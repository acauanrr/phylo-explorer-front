In recent years, with the increase in the availability of data, the need for efficient representation of information increased. Information Visualization has special importance due to its aim on assisting the user in the interpretation of data. Some data change over time, this feature may produce a problem of loss of visual stability in the context. The user often loses information by not being able to track and distinguish the changes that may
occur in the analyzed data set. In this work we studied several information visualization techniques in the literature and propose a visualization approach for text collections that change over time based on phylogenetic trees. Our proposal suggests the reconstruction of the data with phylogenetic trees combined with summarization techniques (Themeriver and Wordclouds) to aid in the interpretation of information. We have analysed document collections tat change over time using this methodology on different datasets.
