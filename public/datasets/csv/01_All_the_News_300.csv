"With Choice of Trade Negotiator, Trump Prepares to Confront Mexico and China - The New York Times",New York Times,Binyamin Appelbaum,2017-01-04,"WASHINGTON  —     Donald J. Trump on Tuesday named as his chief trade negotiator a Washington lawyer who has long advocated protectionist policies, the latest sign that Mr. Trump intends to fulfill his campaign promise to get tough with China, Mexico and other trading partners. Mr. Trump also renewed his episodic campaign to persuade American companies to expand domestic manufacturing, criticizing General Motors via Twitter on Tuesday morning for making in Mexico some of the Chevrolet Cruze hatchbacks it sells domestically. Hours later, Mr. Trump claimed credit after Ford said it would expand vehicle production in Flat Rock, Mich. The choice of Robert Lighthizer (pronounced   ) to be the United States’ trade representative nearly completes Mr. Trump’s selection of top economic advisers and, taken together with the  ’s running commentary on Twitter, underscores Mr. Trump’s focus on making things in America. That is causing unease among some Republicans who regard Mr. Trump’s views on trade as dangerously retrograde, even as they embrace the bulk of his economic agenda. Mainstream economists warn that protectionist policies like import taxes could impose higher prices on consumers and slow economic growth. But some Democrats are signaling a readiness to support Mr. Trump. Nine House Democrats held a news conference Tuesday with the A. F. L. . I. O. president, Richard Trumka, to urge renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada. “We wanted him to know that we’ll work with him on doing that,” Mr. Trumka said. “I don’t think he has enough Republican support to do it, and rewriting the rules of trade is a necessary first step in righting the economy for working people. ” Mr. Trump and his top advisers on trade, including Mr. Lighthizer, share a view that the United States in recent decades prioritized the ideal of free trade over its own  . They argue that other countries are undermining America’s industrial base by subsidizing their own export industries while impeding American importers. They regard this unfair competition as a key reason for the lackluster growth of the economy. In picking Mr. Lighthizer, who has spent much of the last few decades representing American steel producers in their frequent litigation of trade disputes, Mr. Trump is seeking to hire one of Washington’s top trade lawyers to enforce international trade agreements more vigorously. He must be confirmed by the Senate. “He will do an amazing job helping turn around the failed trade policies which have robbed so many Americans of prosperity,” Mr. Trump said in a statement. Mainstream Republicans have sought common ground with Mr. Trump, emphasizing, for example, the importance of enforcing trade rules, but they have not abandoned the party’s longtime advocacy for trade. Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, which will hold hearings on Mr. Lighthizer’s nomination, issued a cautiously supportive statement Tuesday. “As the world and our economic competitors move to expand their global footprints, we can’t afford to be left behind in securing strong deals that will increase our access to new markets for   products and services,” Mr. Hatch said in a statement. “I look forward to a vigorous discussion of Bob’s trade philosophy and priorities. ” Mr. Trump has named a number of advisers on trade, leaving some ambiguity about the division of responsibilities. The   named the economist Peter Navarro, an outspoken critic of China, to lead a new White House office overseeing trade and industrial policy. Mr. Trump also said Wilbur Ross, the billionaire investor and choice for commerce secretary, will play a key role. Mr. Lighthizer, however, is the only member of the triumvirate with government experience. “Those who say U. S. T. R. will be subordinated to other agencies are mistaken,” said Alan Wolff, another former senior American trade official who was the steel industry’s   on trade with Mr. Lighthizer for nearly 20 years, citing Mr. Lighthizer’s encyclopedic knowledge of trade law. “He’ll be a dominant figure on trade, in harmony with Wilbur Ross and Navarro. ” There is also an ideological divide between the people Mr. Trump has named to oversee trade policy and his broader circle of advisers, which is populated by longstanding trade advocates like Gary D. Cohn, the president of Goldman Sachs, who will lead the National Economic Council Rex W. Tillerson, the chief executive of Exxon Mobil, tapped for secretary of state and Gov. Terry Branstad of Iowa, Mr. Trump’s choice for ambassador to China. Proponents of trade hope the broader circle, and congressional Republicans, will exert a moderating influence. “You’re seeing a pretty clear indication that there will be a focus on the enforcement of our trade agreements and on the letter of the law,” said Scott Lincicome, an international trade lawyer at White  Case. “But that doesn’t necessarily mean a significant turn toward protectionism. Even free trade guys like me support enforcement. ” Trade opponents on the left and the right, meanwhile, are hoping Mr. Trump means to break with several decades of   policy. “There’s going to be a war within the Trump administration on where they go with trade, and we’re hoping to energize the worker base he had to make sure they go in the right direction to benefit the American worker,” Mr. Trumka said. Mr. Trump’s promise to immediately designate China as a currency manipulator may offer an early test of the administration’s intentions. Economists see no evidence China is suppressing the value of its currency, although it has done so in the past. Mr. Lincicome said officially labeling China a currency manipulator despite the lack of recent evidence would signal that the administration is taking a hard line on trade issues. A broader shift in trade policy would unfold more slowly. Mr. Trump has promised to renegotiate Nafta the original process took most of three years. He has promised to pursue enforcement actions against other nations, but it takes time to mount cases. He has threatened to impose new tariffs on imports, but sweeping changes most likely would require congressional legislation. Mr. Trump already is seeking to exert influence by seizing the presidential bullhorn. “General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U. S. car   free across border,” he wrote Tuesday on Twitter. “Make in U. S. A. or pay big border tax!” General Motors announced in 2015 that it would make the Cruze in Coahuila, Mexico. American manufacturers are moving   production to Mexico to take advantage of lower labor costs and because of declining domestic demand. They continue to build more expensive vehicles in the United States. Ford’s announcement Tuesday does not reverse that trend. The carmaker said it still planned to move production of the compact Ford Focus from Michigan to Mexico. But it said it would invest in a different Michigan plant to expand production of   vehicles, including its   pickup truck and the Mustang sports car, as well as a new   sport utility vehicle. “We are encouraged by the   policies that   Trump and the new Congress have indicated they will pursue,” said the company’s chief executive, Mark Fields. Mr. Lighthizer served as deputy United States trade representative in the Ronald Reagan administration, when he was involved in pressing Japan to reduce its restrictions on American imports and its subsidies for its own exports. Mr. Trump has criticized China for similar practices, setting the stage for a new round of confrontations. Reagan is often remembered as an advocate for free trade, but his administration in its early hours imposed a quota on Japanese auto imports. It was the first in a long series of measures aimed at putting pressure on the nation that was then regarded, like China in recent years, as a threat to American prosperity. “President Reagan’s pragmatism contrasted strongly with the utopian dreams of free traders,” Mr. Lighthizer wrote in a 2008 piece criticizing Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, for embracing “unbridled” free trade. Conservatives, he argued, “always understood that trade policy was merely a tool for building a strong and independent country with a prosperous middle class. ”"
Trump Appears to Side With Assange Over Intelligence Agencies’ Conclusions - The New York Times,New York Times,"Scott Shane, Maggie Haberman and Julie Hirschfeld Davis",2017-01-05,"Donald J. Trump appears to side with the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange over United States intelligence agencies, with Vice   Mike Pence backing him up. ■ She’s hired: Omarosa Manigault gets a White House post, as do some notable Trump loyalists. But Mr. Trump is leaning on Republican veterans in the Oval Office’s top slots. ■ The   finds something “very strange” about his intelligence briefing on Friday  —   even though the White House says it was always planned for Friday. For the Republican Party, Mr. Assange, the WikiLeaks founder, was once purely a villain. He found little sympathy with conservatives after he leaked American military secrets from Iraq, published purloined diplomatic cables that could have gotten American sources killed and sought refuge in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London, fleeing charges of rape. But now, Mr. Trump appears to be siding with Mr. Assange over the conclusions of America’s intelligence services. Mr. Assange appeared on Fox News on Tuesday night with Sean Hannity, one of Mr. Trump’s biggest news media boosters, to declare once again that the Russians were not the source of the purloined emails that WikiLeaks released from the Democratic National Committee and the personal account of Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, John Podesta. Mr. Trump followed that appearance with a series of Twitter posts on Wednesday that appeared to be preparing his followers for battle once more information on intelligence findings was released, most likely by Thursday. There were actually two separate hackings that the Obama administration has said came from Russian intelligence  —   with “100 percent” certainty. As he has previously, Mr. Assange said: “Our source is not the Russian government. It is not state parties. ” But Mr. Assange has often said that the organization does not always know the identity of its sources. It is highly unlikely that anyone approaching WikiLeaks with the emails obtained by Russian government hacking would acknowledge the source, so it is likely that Mr. Assange cannot be sure of the origin of the emails. Mr. Assange and Mr. Hannity did not address that, in addition to WikiLeaks, the leaked Democratic material was published by two mysterious websites, DCLeaks. com and a blog written by someone called Guccifer 2. 0. American intelligence agencies say they believe both were created by Russian agents. In addition to American intelligence agencies, most private researchers also say they believe that the D. N. C. and Podesta hackings were carried out on orders of Russian government officials, though a few skeptics say they believe the case is unproven by the evidence made public. Mr. Assange’s statement is unlikely to change that conclusion. Intelligence officials will brief Congress on their Russia inquiry on Thursday, ahead of a briefing for Mr. Trump in New York on Friday. Senator John McCain of Arizona, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, will hold the first hearing on the matter on Thursday as well. As for that “terrible” information mentioned by Mr. Trump, the CNN commentator Donna Brazile did send Mr. Podesta an email ahead of a Democratic presidential debate in Flint, Mich. tipping him off that a woman in the audience would ask why the government was not doing more to help clean the city’s   water supply. That was, in fact, reported widely and often, here and here and here and here, among other places. And that was hardly an unexpected query  —   for Mrs. Clinton or for her rival, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. It did cause Ms. Brazile to lose her CNN post. The   appears to be getting a jump on the news. Vice   Mike Pence defended Mr. Trump’s Assange posts at a Capitol Hill news conference Wednesday, effectively doubling down on the incoming administration’s icy blasts toward United States intelligence. Mr. Trump “expressed his very sincere and healthy American skepticism about intelligence conclusions,” Mr. Pence said, with House Republican leaders by his side. Mr. Trump’s remarks have again placed fellow Republicans in an uncomfortable position. Asked on Wednesday morning about the Twitter post, Speaker Paul D. Ryan steered clear of criticizing the   saying he would not be commenting on “every little tweet or Facebook post. ” But he called Mr. Assange “a sycophant for Russia,” who “leaks, steals data and compromises national security. ” Mr. Ryan noted that Mr. Trump had not yet received his latest briefing on Russia. “Hopefully, he’ll get up to speed on what’s been happening and what Russia has or has not done,” he said. Ms. Manigault, the villain and diva from Mr. Trump’s reality television show “The Apprentice,” was officially named assistant to the president and director of communications for the White House Office of Public Liaison, one of a slate of Wednesday appointments that went to ardent Trump loyalists. The appointments include Bill Stepien, a confidant of Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey and a figure in the “Bridgegate” scandal, who will be White House political director. Keith Schiller, who was head of private security at Mr. Trump’s real estate company, will be director of Oval Office operations. John DeStefano, a longtime aide to former House Speaker John A. Boehner, will direct presidential personnel. And George Gigicos, who organized those giant campaign rallies, will be director of advance, a further indicator that Mr. Trump plans to continue that sort of thing as president. But for star power, no one is going to beat Ms. Manigault. Ms. Manigault aside, Mr. Trump is turning to some seasoned veterans to run key operations in his White House. Mr. Trump announced on Wednesday that he had selected Joe Hagin, who served for 14 years in the White House under Roanld Reagan, George Bush and George W. Bush, as his deputy chief of staff for operations, a key post in which he will be responsible for organizing presidential trips and security, among other things. He named Rick Dearborn, who has 25 years of experience on Capitol Hill, as his chief liaison to Congress, heading the Office of Legislative Affairs as well as the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs and Cabinet Affairs. Katie Walsh, who was chief of staff at the Republican National Committee under Reince Priebus, Mr. Trump’s incoming chief of staff, will become his deputy at the White House, overseeing senior staff, scheduling and the Office of Public Liaison. In a statement, Mr. Priebus called the three a “team of doers” who would fill critical roles. Kellyanne Conway, who served as counselor to Mr. Trump, said she was thrilled to have “another strong female leader” on the team in Ms. Walsh. First, Mr. Trump said that the nation should move beyond talk of Russian interference in the presidential election, but that he would listen to what American intelligence experts had to say. Then, on New Year’s Eve, the   promised that by Tuesday or Wednesday, he would reveal information on the hacking that Americans do not know. And now, he seems to think the intelligence community has not quite gotten its story straight. The Obama administration quickly let it be known that, in fact, intelligence leaders always intended to brief Mr. Trump on Friday in New York. And intelligence officials were not amused. Nor were some Republican political consultants. But this is not the first time the   has taken a swipe at the intelligence community, which has concluded that Russia tried to help get him elected president. President Obama is on Capitol Hill on Wednesday to plot a strategy to save his signature domestic achievement, the Affordable Care Act. Vice   Mike Pence countered with his own visit to congressional Republicans. “The first order of business is to repeal and replace Obamacare,” Mr. Pence said. “It needs to be done. ” And Mr. Trump weighed in on Twitter, trying to stiffen Republican spines as Democrats press their point that a fast gutting of the law will endanger the health care of 20 million people covered under the law and put at risk tens of millions more with   health problems. “Schumer clowns” may not be an olive branch to Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the new minority leader, but it is a signal that the incoming president is ready for war over health care. “Republicans should stop clowning around with Americans’ Medicare, Medicaid and health care,” Mr. Schumer responded after meeting with the president. He warned that Republicans would “throw the entire health care system into chaos. ” Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House minority leader, tried to coin a phrase: “Make America sick again? Is that what Republicans want?” The Trump transition office named the lawyer Jay Clayton to be the next chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The last time Mr. Trump held a real news conference was on July 27, when he said President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia had called him a genius and wrongly insisted that “many people” saw bombs strewn all over the floor of the San Bernardino, Calif. attackers’ home and failed to report it. That long stretch without a real news media grilling did not do him much harm. He did, after all, win the election. But he says he will hold a true, open news conference next Wednesday. No word yet whether this session will take the place of the one he scheduled for last month, then canceled, to specifically reveal his plans for the future of his corporation."
California Hires Eric Holder as Legal Bulwark Against Donald Trump - The New York Times,New York Times,Adam Nagourney,2017-01-05,"LOS ANGELES  —   Girding for four years of potential battles with   Donald J. Trump, Democratic leaders of the California Legislature announced Wednesday that they had hired Eric H. Holder Jr. who was attorney general under President Obama, to represent them in any legal fights against the new Republican White House. The decision by the Legislature to retain Mr. Holder, who is now a prominent Washington lawyer, is the latest sign of  the ideological battle that may play out over the next four years between this predominantly Democratic state and Washington. Hillary Clinton, the Democratic candidate for president, defeated Mr. Trump by more than four million votes here. “Having the former attorney general of the United States brings us a lot of firepower in order to prepare to safeguard the values of the people of California,” Kevin de León, the Democratic leader of the Senate, said in an interview. “This means we are very, very serious. ” Mr. de León said he expected California to challenge Washington  —   and defend itself from policies instituted in Washington  —   on issues including the environment, immigration and criminal justice. He said California Democrats decided to turn to Mr. Holder as they watched Mr. Trump assemble his cabinet and begin to set the tone for his presidency. “It was very clear that it wasn’t just campaign rhetoric,” Mr. de León said of Mr. Trump’s proposals over the past year. “He was surrounding himself with people who are a very clear and present danger to the economic prosperity of California. ” Mr. Trump did not immediately return requests for comment. The move by Mr. de León and his Democratic counterpart in the Assembly, Anthony Rendon, follows Gov. Jerry Brown’s appointment of Representative Xavier Becerra as attorney general last month, to succeed Kamala D. Harris, who was elected to the United States Senate. That appointment made Mr. Becerra one of the   Latino officials in this state, and he is expected to be instrumental in battling with the Trump White House over any attempt to enforce stringent measures aimed at immigrants. Mr. Brown has made clear that he intends to challenge the administration on global warming and that his attorney general will be a key to that battle. The Democratic Party controls   of both the Assembly and the Senate in California. Every statewide elected official is a Democrat. Mr. Holder was Mr. Obama’s attorney general from 2009 to 2015. He was the first   to hold that position. He is a partner at Covington  Burling, a law firm in Washington that specializes in representing states and companies against the federal government. “I am honored that the Legislature chose Covington to serve as its legal adviser as it considers how to respond to potential changes in federal law that could impact California’s residents and policy priorities,” Mr. Holder said in a statement. “I am confident that our expertise across a wide array of federal legal and regulatory issues will be a great resource to the Legislature. ” The Legislature has an ample stable of lawyers on staff, but officials said Mr. Holder and his firm brought specific litigation and political skills that could be needed in the coming years. Mr. de León said the final compensation for the firm had not been set, but would be publicly disclosed once it was. “The cost will be very minimal compared to the billions of dollars at stake if California doesn’t adequately make its case,” he said."
Israeli Soldier Who Shot Wounded Palestinian Assailant Is Convicted - The New York Times,New York Times,Isabel Kershner,2017-01-05,"JERUSALEM  —   The fate of just one   Israeli soldier was hanging in the balance. But for many Israelis, the guilty verdict announced on Wednesday was a critical turn in the battle for the character of the state. When the military judges convicted Sgt. Elor Azaria of manslaughter for shooting a Palestinian assailant in the head as he lay wounded on the ground, they were ruling not just on his conduct but also on the host of ethical and political issues it raised. Since the shooting in the occupied West Bank city of Hebron in March, the case has polarized Israelis and rocked the pedestal on which the military normally stands. With the 50th anniversary of Israel’s occupation of the West Bank approaching, the highly charged trial had fueled a debate about military ethics and the place of the army in Israeli society. The verdict did little to heal the rifts the trial had exposed: Hours after it was rendered, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu joined a chorus of voices calling for the soldier to be pardoned. “This is a difficult and painful day for us all,” Mr. Netanyahu said in a Facebook post supporting a pardon, which can be granted by Israel’s president or the army’s top officials. Referring to the Israel Defense Forces, he added, “The soldiers of the I. D. F. are our sons and daughters, and they need to remain above any dispute. ” Prof. David Enoch, an expert in the philosophy of law at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, said he thought the manslaughter conviction was “justified” but added, “I’m not sure this verdict will be welcomed by many of the soldiers and much of the public. ” The military’s rules make clear that assailants must be quickly incapacitated, but that once the threat is neutralized, they should not be killed. Rights groups and other critics have accused Israeli soldiers and police officers of being too quick to pull the trigger, particularly in response to a recent spate of deadly stabbings, shootings and car attacks by Palestinians. The Hebron killing, caught in chilling completeness in a video that quickly went viral worldwide, for many critics crystallized the question of excessive force, and even military leaders said Sergeant Azaria acted without justification. But in Israel, a country where military service is a part of national identity, many Jews called for backing up young soldiers sent on dangerous missions and said that Sergeant Azaria had been in an impossible situation and had little chance of an acquittal, since that would have put his commanders in a bad light. Israel’s defense minister, Avigdor Lieberman, called Wednesday’s decision “a tough verdict. ” “The first thing I ask of all of us  —   those who like the verdict and those like me who like it much less  —   we are all obligated to respect the court’s decision,” Mr. Lieberman said. “We are obligated to maintain restraint. ” Mr. Lieberman, as a member of the parliamentary opposition before his cabinet appointment, had attended the military court to support Sergeant Azaria and called the legal proceedings a “theater of the absurd. ” But on Wednesday, he said, “We must keep the army above and beyond all political argument. ” Politicians to Mr. Netanyahu’s right and left have also called for a pardon, including the education minister, Naftali Bennett, and Shelly Yacimovich of the Labor Party, who said that “Azaria’s shoulders are too narrow to bear the entire weight of the fissure” the case has exposed. Some Israeli experts compared the Azaria verdict to the Kafr Qassem ruling of more than 60 years ago, after border police officers fatally shot 49 Arab men, women and children as they returned from work in the fields, unwittingly breaking a curfew. The murder convictions of officers in that case established that security forces must refuse to follow a “patently illegal order” that carries a “black flag” of criminality. It helped shape the army’s ethos. Now, some fear that in the lower ranks, it has begun to erode. In a measure of the tensions, the verdict was handed down in a special court inside the walled and heavily guarded compound of the military’s headquarters in Tel Aviv, rather than in the courtroom where the trial was held, to keep demonstrators at bay. Video footage showed Sergeant Azaria smiling as he entered the courtroom to applause, and he was embraced by his family and friends. Hundreds of protesters gathered outside the compound, shouting slogans like “free the boy. ” Col. Maya Heller, one of the military judges, spent more than two and a half hours delivering the verdict. She systematically rejected the main points of the defense and said there had been “no justification” for the shooting, according to reports from the courtroom. Describing Sergeant Azaria’s telling of the event as “twisting” and “evolving,” the judge said the defense had tried to “hold the rope at both ends. ” On one hand it asserted that the victim, Abed     appeared to pose a danger because he was still moving, and on the other it brought medical witnesses who contended that he was dead by the time Sergeant Azaria shot him in the head. The judge seemed to give great weight to statements Sergeant Azaria, a medic who was 19 at the time, made at the scene, indicating he had acted not out of fear but for revenge. A soldier testified that before the shooting, Sergeant Azaria had said, “How is it that my friend was stabbed and the terrorist is still alive?” After the shooting, a commander who was at the scene recalled Sergeant Azaria saying, “The terrorist deserved to die. ” Ilan Katz, one of Sergeant Azaria’s lawyers, vowed to appeal. The military’s high command had denounced the shooting immediately after it happened, calling it a grave breach of proper military conduct. But Israeli society was divided against the backdrop of continued Palestinian attacks, many   politicians and celebrities, along with Jewish parents of soldiers, hailed Sergeant Azaria as a hero. Mr. Netanyahu first condemned Sergeant Azaria’s actions, then phoned the soldier’s family to offer sympathy and reassurances that he would be treated fairly. Local television stations frequently showed images of Sergeant Azaria’s distraught parents hugging him in court. Appealing to public sentiment in a country blighted by wars and terrorism, and where most Jewish    are conscripted for up to 32 months of military service, his supporters portrayed him as “everybody’s child. ” In remarks recorded before the verdict, the military’s chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Gadi Eisenkot, tried to puncture that narrative. “An    in the Israeli Army is not ‘everybody’s child,’” he said. “He is a fighter, a soldier who must dedicate his life to carry out the tasks we give him. We cannot be confused about this. ” The episode began when two Palestinian men stabbed and wounded an Israeli soldier at a checkpoint in Hebron. Israeli soldiers killed one and wounded the other, Mr. Sharif, 21. Sergeant Azaria arrived at the scene about six minutes later. The video showed calm had been restored. Yet 11 minutes after the initial attack, he cocked his rifle and shot Mr. Sharif as he lay on the road. Lawyers representing Sergeant Azaria said he had acted to save his comrades, in the belief that Mr. Sharif, who was still moving, might have been concealing an explosive belt under his jacket. But Sergeant Azaria did not warn the other soldiers or the medical staff nearby to move away. During the trial, Sergeant Azaria’s company commander, Maj. Tom Naaman, said he “did not feel any danger” from Mr. Sharif, undercutting the defendant’s claims. Yusri   Mr. Sharif’s father, told reporters that the verdict was “a good step” but that he hoped there would be no lenience in the sentencing, which is scheduled for Jan. 15. Ahmad Tibi, an Arab member of the Israeli Parliament, said on  Twitter that dozens of soldiers and commanders who killed Palestinians should have been convicted. “Fifty years of occupation add up to much more than one Azaria,” Mr. Tibi wrote."
Work. Walk 5 Minutes. Work. - The New York Times,New York Times,Gretchen Reynolds,2017-01-09,"Stuck at your work desk? Standing up and walking around for five minutes every hour during the workday could lift your mood, combat lethargy without reducing focus and attention, and even dull hunger pangs, according to an instructive new study. The study, which also found that frequent, brief walking breaks were more effective at improving   than a single, longer walk before work, could provide the basis for a simple, realistic New Year’s exercise resolution for those of us bound to our desks all day. There is growing evidence, of course, that long bouts of uninterrupted sitting can have undesirable physical and emotional consequences. Studies have shown that sitting motionless reduces blood flow to the legs, increasing the risk for atherosclerosis, the buildup of plaques in the arteries. People who sit for more than eight or nine hours daily, which for many of us describes a typical workday, also are at heightened risk for diabetes, depression and obesity compared with people who move more often. In response, researchers and some bosses have proposed a variety of methods for helping people reduce their sitting time at work, including standing workstations and treadmill desks. But such options are cumbersome and costly, making them impractical for many work situations. Some experts have worried, too, that if people are physically active at the office, they might subsequently become more tired, grumpy, distracted or hungry, any of which could have an undesirable effect on work performance and   health. So for the new study, which was published in November in the International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity, researchers from the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, the Johnson  Johnson Human Performance Institute and other institutions decided to test several methods of increasing movement among office workers. (The study was funded largely by Johnson  Johnson, with additional support from the Colorado Nutrition Obesity Research Center.) To start, the researchers invited 30 sedentary adult office workers to a university clinic to complete a battery of health tests and questionnaires. The researchers measured their heart rates and stress hormone levels and asked them to rank, on a numerical scale, how energetic or tired they felt, as well as how happy they were, and whether they were feeling peckish or had little appetite just then. The volunteers also completed computerized games designed primarily to test their ability to concentrate and make decisions. Then, on three subsequent visits to the clinic, each volunteer simulated a   workday. During one visit, the volunteers sat for the whole time with no interruptions, except for bathroom breaks. During another, they walked moderately for 30 minutes at the start of their experimental day, and then sat for the next five and a half hours with no additional scheduled breaks. Finally, during a third visit, the volunteers sat for most of the six hours, but began each hour with five minutes of moderate walking, using treadmills at the clinic. At the start and end of each session, the researchers drew blood to check levels of stress hormones. And periodically throughout each day, they asked their volunteers to numerically rate their moods, energy, fatigue and appetites. The volunteers also repeated the computerized testing of their thinking skills at the close of each session. The researchers then analyzed the data. The numbers showed that on almost all measures, the subjects’ ratings of how they were feeling rose when they did not sit for six uninterrupted hours. They said that they felt much more energetic throughout the day if they had been active, whether that activity was bunched into a single longish walk at the start of the day or distributed into multiple brief breaks. On other measures, though, the   walks were more potent than the concentrated   version. When the workers rose most often, they reported greater happiness, less fatigue and considerably less craving for food than on either of the other days. Their feelings of vigor also tended to increase throughout the day, while they often had plateaued by early afternoon after walking only once in the morning. There were no differences on the scores on the cognitive tests, whether they sat all day or got up and moved. Stress hormones also remained steady during each visit. These results suggest that “even a little bit of activity, spread throughout the day, is a practical, easy way to improve ” says Jack Groppel, a study author and a founder of the Johnson  Johnson Human Performance Institute. He points out that the walking breaks did not cause people to feel more tired or hungry, but instead had the opposite effect. They also did not alter people’s ability to focus, so, in theory, should not affect productivity (for good or ill). This study, however, was small in scale,   and limited by its dependence on the volunteers’ perceptions of their responses to the experiment. But even so, “it’s clear that moving matters,” Dr. Groppel says. So set your 2017 appointment calendar, he suggests, to devote five minutes every hour to physical activity, whether you walk up and down a staircase, along a corridor or just pace around your office."
It’s Time to Ignore Advice About Which Stocks to Buy in 2017 - The New York Times,New York Times,Damon Darlin,2017-01-09,"It’s that time of year when financial advice sites issue their lists of the “Stocks to Buy for 2017. ” Before you take them up on their suggestions, let’s look at how well such portfolios did in 2016. The portfolios of stocks they were telling you to buy generally did much worse than the stock market over all. The results underline what many personal finance experts recommend: Invest in a broad,   mutual index fund. (The Times’s “Your Money” columnist wrote more on this here.) In 2016, the broad S. P. stock index increased 9. 5 percent. But if you invested in Forbes’s 2016 list, your money grew about 7 percent. Kiplinger’s was about half that. A list that appeared on the Money magazine site garnered 4. 9 percent, and Barron’s returned 5. 3 percent. One such list at CNBC did a little better than most at 10. 6 percent. But Vanguard’s Total Stock index fund returned 12. 5 percent in the same period. We even calculated these returns by assuming that any of the dividends were reinvested, but still none beat the widely owned index fund. There is nothing wrong with these lists if you are using them as mere suggestions of what companies might be worth investigating. There were some bona fide winners on almost every list: Goldman Sachs, Kennametal, Ellie Mae, Douglas Dynamics,   Burlington Stores. You might not have heard of some of those companies, so it’s not a bad place to look for ideas. But the problem with such lists is that they encourage people to approach investing the wrong way. Unsophisticated investors are being persuaded that they should own a sheaf of stocks. But as you can see, even when the stocks are recommended by professional money managers and filtered through some of the best financial journalists, they don’t do as well as the averages. The best advice remains the same: If you have money you want to play with, go have some fun with a few stocks that you can monitor closely. If you keep it simple, it’s easier to track and respond.

"Megyn Kelly’s Jump to NBC From Fox News Will Test Her, and the Networks - The New York Times",New York Times,Jim Rutenberg,2017-01-05,"For Megyn Kelly, the shift from Fox News to NBC  —   where she will host a daily daytime show and a Sunday newsmagazine program  —   will be a test of whether she can connect with a broader audience in a different format and reach another level of television stardom. But her move, announced Tuesday, has broader implications for the television news industry, raising new questions about the future of Fox News, where she was a countervailing presence in an opinion lineup heavy with   ideology, and of NBC News, which has been a longtime bête noire for conservative press critics. And it comes as all news organizations gird for a new era of media coverage that arrives Jan. 20 with the inauguration of Donald J. Trump. The Murdoch family, which controls Fox News’s parent company, 21st Century Fox, had become so invested in Ms. Kelly as a franchise that they were prepared to pay her a salary of more than $20 million a year. People inside and outside the network widely took that to mean the Murdochs were staking the network’s future on a journalist who effectively made her name by upending the expectations for a Fox News anchor  —   for instance, by publicly taking on the Republican nominee for president. But now Fox News, long the cable news ratings leader and an influential voice in the national political debate, is on course to begin coverage of a new administration with no   anchor with Ms. Kelly’s history of challenging Mr. Trump. Her show, “The Kelly File,” was sandwiched between the   program of Bill O’Reilly  —   she was regularly second to him in the cable news ratings  —   and that of Mr. Trump’s major booster, Sean Hannity. Her departure, coming after that of Greta Van Susteren, also means that Fox faces the prospect of having no female host in prime time. That is a potentially troubling development for the network as its seeks to move past last summer‘s sexual harassment scandal involving its   and former chairman, Roger Ailes, in which many women described experiencing harassment or intimidation. (Fox is said to be looking at several potential female successors for Ms. Kelly.) For NBC, the addition of Ms. Kelly, 46, may help address a challenge confronting many major news organizations: connecting with a politically diverse audience. In bringing Ms. Kelly to NBC, Andrew Lack, the chairman of the news division, is adding a journalist schooled in the preferences and worldviews of the conservative Americans who helped elect Mr. Trump, and whose anger so many news organizations failed to appreciate. Ms. Kelly’s closely watched career move capped months of drama in the political sphere, in which she was often at the center of Mr. Trump’s intense,   campaign, and in the media world, where she became a key figure in the events that led to Mr. Ailes’s ouster. Ms. Kelly was the most prominent among a group of women at the network who told internal investigators that Mr. Ailes had engaged in inappropriate behavior. (Mr. Ailes has denied all the accusations.) Despite having made a generous offer to Ms. Kelly, Rupert Murdoch, an executive chairman of 21st Century Fox, whose   negotiation tactics are legendary, offered a supportive statement about her decision to leave. “We thank Megyn Kelly for her 12 years of contributions to Fox News,” the statement read. “We hope she enjoys tremendous success in her career and wish her and her family the best. ” Though the loss of Ms. Kelly is a blow to Fox News, the network has a winning formula that has kept it atop the ratings for many years, and helped it to avoid the   its rivals experienced in the weeks after Election Day, as The Associated Press reported. And now the nation has a new Republican president whose approach speaks to the sensibilities of many of Fox’s viewers. Company executives said the Murdochs knew Ms. Kelly was a flight risk their offer included keeping her in prime time, and she had made it clear she was seeking a job that would give her more time for her family. Ms. Kelly had spoken with top executives at ABC News, CNN and in the syndication industry, as well as NBC News, but NBC remained largely under the radar as a landing spot. One person briefed on Ms. Kelly’s deliberations said that Mr. Lack won her over by starting the talks with a question about what she was seeking, instead of flatly offering possibilities. He then came back with a deal that was tailored to her preferences. A daytime show would give her a schedule that would allow her to see her children off to school and to have dinner with them and her husband, Douglas Brunt, a novelist. People briefed on the talks, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, declined to disclose what Ms. Kelly’s new annual salary would be at NBC. Fox News rivals who sought to hire Ms. Kelly away, including NBC News, had indicated that they could not match the $20 million offer from Fox, the cable news leader for the last 15 years running. But even a modest raise for Ms. Kelly would place her among television’s   journalists. The Wall Street Journal recently reported she was to collect $15 million for the final year of her contract. Her high price tag was worth it for Mr. Lack, who took over leadership of NBC News and MSNBC in 2015, 14 years after he had ended an   tenure running the divisions. Executives at NBC Universal turned to him to stabilize the network after the suspension of the nightly news anchor Brian Williams for embellishing accounts of his reporting in Iraq, and as MSNBC floundered in the ratings. Among his moves since returning has been to direct MSNBC back toward more traditional, hard news coverage during its daytime hours  —   like its cable news rivals, it hit record ratings highs last year  —   and away from its yearslong market position as a   answer to Fox News, which at times colored the reputation of its sister, NBC News. Ms. Kelly will not be reporting for MSNBC, which still has     hosts like Rachel Maddow and Lawrence O’Donnell. In a brief interview, Mr. Lack said he would be closely involved in the creation of Ms. Kelly’s daytime show, which will run Monday through Friday at a time to be determined, as well as the one she will anchor on Sunday nights. That show will be in the vein of CBS’s “60 Minutes,” where Mr. Lack worked early in his career. “The thing about this that is challenging but exciting as hell is that we love making new shows,” he said. “You don’t get that opportunity that often any more, and you don’t get the opportunity to do that with a talent like Megyn. ” Yet the move has its risks for all involved, especially the daytime program. Daytime television has been notoriously difficult for news stars. People involved in the discussions said that the program was not planned to be in the mold of a traditional daytime talk show, nor much like the     special Ms. Kelly hosted last May on the Fox broadcast network, which drew some harsh criticism (some of which Ms. Kelly dismissed as liberal disappointment over a friendly interview with Mr. Trump). In an interview with Charlie Rose on “CBS Sunday Morning” last year, Ms. Kelly described the television show of her fantasies. “How about if we merge a little Charlie Rose, a little Oprah, and a little me all together,’’ she said. “And we serve that up as an hour? Wouldn’t you watch that?” Ms. Kelly kept a relatively low profile on Tuesday, addressing her own news at the end of that night’s edition of “The Kelly File. ” “This was a tough decision for me,” Ms. Kelly said, thanking the Murdochs and attributing the move in part to her desire for more time with her children. Her last show on Fox is on Friday."
Anchor Becomes the News as Megyn Kelly Leaves Fox News for NBC - The New York Times,New York Times,John Koblin and Michael M. Grynbaum,2017-01-04,"Megyn Kelly’s new office at NBC News sits a block north of Fox News headquarters in Midtown Manhattan. But it might as well be a world away. In switching networks at a pivotal point in her career, Ms. Kelly, the No.   personality in cable television news, is taking a calculated risk that she can swap her dedicated Fox audience for the broader, but more fickle, viewership of network television. There are challenges from the  . Her splashy arrival has the potential to fray nerves among the big personalities at the network  —   who already compete against one another for interviews and scoops. Ms. Kelly, 46, will also be taking on a daytime talk show format that has been a virtual graveyard for television news personalities in the last 10 years. And the new Sunday newsmagazine show that NBC plans to build around Ms. Kelly will go up against a giant that has not been meaningfully challenged for decades: “60 Minutes” on CBS. Still, Ms. Kelly is a bona fide star with a   book and a breakout role in this year’s presidential campaign, when she clashed with Donald J. Trump. NBC News comes out the winner in one of the most closely watched talent sweepstakes in years, acquiring one of television’s biggest names who could play a role in any number of major network events, like coverage of elections or the Olympics. Interviews on Tuesday with network executives and producers  —   from Fox, NBC and other rival channels  —   suggest that Ms. Kelly’s performance at NBC will be as closely watched in the industry as her past few months of contract negotiations. Ms. Kelly will have to design her daytime talk show from scratch. Even though she made her name as a news anchor, she has argued that she is not obsessed with politics. When she hosted a   special on Fox in May  —   her first major foray outside cable news  —   she expressed a desire to combine the qualities of Oprah Winfrey, Barbara Walters and Charlie Rose. That special  —   which featured interviews with Mr. Trump, the celebrity lawyer Robert Shapiro and the actress Laverne Cox  —   received middling reviews. It was far from a ratings hit: Among adults younger than 50, the demographic most important to broadcasters, Ms. Kelly’s special performed about as well as ABC’s “Beyond the Tank,” a   spinoff. A daily daytime talk show also poses risks.   talent like Jane Pauley, Meredith Vieira, Katie Couric and Anderson Cooper have taken a stab at the genre in the past, and each one failed. In Ms. Pauley’s case, NBC invested millions of dollars, but the show was yanked in 2005 after just one year. NBC said on Tuesday that Ms. Kelly’s show was expected to be closer to a news program than the typical daytime talk show, although it is unclear what exactly that will mean or how much appetite there is for news amid a landscape including shows like “Days of Our Lives,” “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” and “Steve Harvey. ” The audience for daytime television is also significantly more diverse than Fox’s   viewership. Starting a Sunday rival to “60 Minutes,” the   among newsmagazines, is likewise no easy task. “Rock Center,” which Brian Williams hosted, lasted two seasons. NBC’s most recent newsmagazine, “On Assignment,” ran    against “60 Minutes” over five weeks the show averaged about four million viewers, compared with more than nine million for “60 Minutes,” which broadcast two repeats during that time. (This season, “60 Minutes” is averaging more than 14 million viewers.) It is also unclear how NBC will accommodate Ms. Kelly’s show during the National Football League season, when NBC’s popular “Sunday Night Football” package includes a highly rated pregame show that begins at 7 p. m. Eastern. But Andrew Lack, NBC News’s chairman, has long had newsmagazines in his blood. In addition to overseeing a “60 Minutes” competitor on CBS in the 1980s, Mr. Lack presided over NBC in the 1990s when newsmagazines, including the network’s popular “Dateline,” dominated   lineups. Fox, meanwhile, must now set a course without one of its biggest names, as the network continues to recalibrate itself after the ouster of its chairman, Roger Ailes. Ms. Kelly’s exit from Fox News was so abrupt that it was announced on the day that the network had run a   ad in The Wall Street Journal trumpeting the ratings of its   lineup, with Ms. Kelly prominently pictured. Her departure stunned the Fox newsroom, where journalists and executives spent Tuesday afternoon speculating over which anchor might replace Ms. Kelly in the coveted 9 p. m. slot  —   and wondering if Ms. Kelly would even appear that night. When Greta Van Susteren, another veteran anchor, announced her departure in September, network representatives visited her home to tell her not to bother coming in. In the end, Ms. Kelly was granted a chance to bid farewell to Fox News viewers  —   her last show is Friday. It is not clear who will replace her. Fox News has never had an     lineup. Potential replacements being floated inside the network on Tuesday include four women who have regularly filled in for Ms. Kelly: Sandra Smith, a host of Fox’s noon show, “Outnumbered” Trish Regan, a rising star at Fox Business Network Shannon Bream, who covers the Supreme Court and Martha MacCallum, a morning anchor. Kimberly Guilfoyle, a host of “The Five” who is friendly with Mr. Trump’s circle, and Tucker Carlson, who has put up high ratings since taking over Fox News’s 7 p. m. slot, have also been suggested. Sean Hannity, whose viewership at 10 p. m. increased enormously in 2016 and has spiked since Election Day, could be moved up an hour, but his momentum in his time slot may make Fox executives reluctant to make a switch. One winner in the sweepstakes for Ms. Kelly could be CNN, even though it did not succeed in recruiting her. CNN, while still behind Fox News in total viewers by a wide margin, has occasionally beaten Fox among viewers 25 to 54, the demographic that determines advertising rates. In 2016, CNN finished within 58, 000 viewers of Fox in prime time in the demographic  —   cutting Fox’s lead in half. Since the election, Fox has regained a sizable lead, but now, without spending a penny, CNN will now have an opportunity to take another run at Fox’s   advantage."
President Xi’s Great Chinese Soccer Dream - The New York Times,New York Times,Chris Buckley,2017-02-01,"QINGYUAN, China  —   The 48 soccer fields of the vast Evergrande Football School in south China seem barely enough for its 2, 800 students. Against a backdrop of school spires that seem modeled on Hogwarts, the young athletes swarm onto the fields nearly every day, kicking, dribbling and passing in the hope of soccer glory and riches. “Soccer will be my career after I grow up,” Wang Kai, a gangly    who has studied at the boarding school for over three years, said after a morning session under the supervision of a Spanish coach. “I want to be the Chinese Cristiano Ronaldo,” he said, referring to the Portuguese superstar. Grooming the next Ronaldo or Messi has become a national project in China, where the country’s No. 1 fan, President Xi Jinping, is bent on transforming the country into a great soccer power. It is a moonshot for China, whose teams have ranked poor to middling in recent international competition. But the effort has already unleashed a surge of spending and support for the game that has stunned fans and players around the world. In the last two weeks, the main Chinese league has plucked foreign stars from Europe and South America with contracts reported to be worth as much as $40 million a year, the highest pay for any soccer player in the world. A Chinese club offered the real Ronaldo $105 million a year, but he declined, his agent said last week. These giddying sums are shaking the landscape of pro soccer. Antonio Conte, the manager of England’s fabled Chelsea team, denounced the Chinese spending spree last month as a “danger for all teams in the world. ” The drive to match China’s economic ascent with success on the soccer field has become emblematic of Mr. Xi’s ambition to transform China into a great and confident power. “My biggest hope for Chinese soccer is that its teams become among the world’s best,” he announced in 2015. In the last two years, the government has poured the kind of concentrated effort into soccer that it has previously devoted to winning Olympic medals in individual sports like diving and gymnastics. It has promised to clean up and reorganize professional soccer and build a new generation of players by creating tens of thousands of soccer fields and adding soccer programs in tens of thousands of schools. The aim is to establish a flow of top players eventually capable of winning the coveted men’s World Cup and returning the women’s team to its former glory. That effort has emboldened Chinese clubs to spend lavishly. As well as paying tens of millions for foreign players, Chinese team owners have spent hundreds of millions of dollars buying into European clubs, hoping to tap their coaching and marketing expertise. “Current spending has created massive expectations,” said Simon Chadwick, a professor of sports enterprise at the University of Salford in Britain. “Spending big on players is also about acquiring heroes and icons. ” But if soccer distills Mr. Xi’s national ambitions, it also illustrates how his plans could falter, as they have in other arenas, in a muddle of rushed and distorted enforcement, especially at the local level. There has been resistance by parents, worried about their children taking precious time away from academics, as well as fear that splurging on foreign stars diverts money and attention from fostering homegrown talent. The pitfalls in fixing soccer, it turns out, are a bit like those in fixing the economy a desire for quick, flashy success is putting   goals at risk. People’s Daily, the main newspaper of the Communist Party, warned last month of a “bubble” of reckless spending in Chinese professional soccer that could burst and badly damage the sport. Too many investors had feverish expectations, while some clubs, officials and schools were only going through the motions of developing young players, the newspaper said. “One of the biggest problems is ” said Cameron Wilson, a Scottish resident of Shanghai who edits Wild East Football, a website that follows the sport in China. “There are these great plans and ideas. But when it gets down to the   level in the provinces, it’s like people doing their own thing. ” China’s passionate soccer fans would be thrilled to have competitive national teams instead of the lackluster ones they have now. The national men’s team recently placed 83rd in FIFA rankings, just ahead of the Faroe Islands, a remote outcrop of Denmark with fewer than 50, 000 inhabitants, and it is unlikely to win a spot in the 2018 World Cup. The women’s team  —   the pride of Chinese soccer in past decades  —   has stumbled. It was   for the Women’s World Cup in 1999 but slipped to 13th in the latest  rankings. “The national team is a joke,” said Xu Yun, 16, who had come to Workers’ Stadium in Beijing to watch his favorite Beijing team clobber a listless opponent from Henan Province. “I think it will need decades to get it right. It’s not just a question of spending money, it’s attitude. ” For years, the domestic professional game was riddled with corruption, brazen even by China’s   standards. Since   revelations grew into a national scandal in 2009, the worst cheating has been cleaned up. “It still exists,” Mr. Wilson said. “Just not so blatantly. ” For Xi, soccer has been a passion since childhood. His trips abroad have included photographs with David Beckham and other soccer celebrities. In Ireland in 2012, he famously had an enthusiastic but seemingly rusty go at kicking a ball. In September, he revisited his old school in Beijing, where he learned to kick and became a fan of the game, according to memoirs of his former teacher. “Look how healthy I am,” Mr. Xi told young soccer players at the school. “I laid the basis for that through sports when I was young. ” Private investors have piled into professional soccer, encouraged by Xi’s backing for the game and apparently eager to curry favor with his government. In the main pro trading season last year, the 16 Chinese Super League teams spent about $300 million hiring away promising foreign players, outstripping player spending by the English Premier League by nearly $120 million, according to FIFA TMS, a player transfer data company. Prices in 2017 are likely to go even higher. But Mr. Xi’s focus is on the long game and the next generation of players. His plan calls for 50, 000 schools to have a strong emphasis on soccer by 2025, a leap from 5, 000 in 2015. The number of soccer fields across the country will grow to over 70, 000 by the end of 2020, from under 11, 000. By then, the plan says, 50 million Chinese, including 30 million students, will regularly play soccer. “Now principals at every school are paying quite a bit more attention to soccer,” said Dai Wei, the athletic director at r. Xi’s old school, the Bayi School. “That was unthinkable before. ” Yet there is deep cultural resistance, even at Bayi. Some parents discourage their children from committing time to sports, Mr. Dai said, because they have so much homework and face stiff competition on academic exams. While China has excelled at individual sports that demand intense discipline from an early age, the country has not done as well at fostering group sports, where skills like teamwork and improvisation count as much as personal virtuosity. The privately run Evergrande school, the world’s biggest soccer boarding school, says its formula of intense training combined with a solid education could show the way for developing young players. “As more soccer schools are built, there’ll be more and more kids playing, and the stars will multiply, too,” said Liu Jiangnan, the principal of the school, which opened in 2012. “I’d guess that in seven or eight years, half the members of the Chinese national squad will come from this school. ” Drawn by such hopes, parents pay up to about $8, 700 a year to send children here, where 24 Spanish coaches oversee training. Students spend 90 minutes a day on drills and also play on weekends. Promising players get scholarships, and children from poorer families get discounts, school officials said. But even here, the children come to the game later than their European and South American counterparts, and they often lack solid grounding in teamwork and tactics, said Sergio Zarco Diaz, a Spanish coach. “The kids are getting better, year by year,” he said hopefully. But the Evergrande approach is too expensive to be widely copied. Some schools, facing a shortage of coaches and space for fields, have devised their own drills, like soccer gymnastics, in which children stand in lines tossing a ball up, down and around. It may impress visiting officials, but it is scant preparation for the free flow of the game, said Zhang Lu, a widely respected soccer commentator. “Chinese soccer has failed before through rushing for instant success,” Mr. Zhang said in an interview in Beijing, recalling previous failed efforts to build up the game in the 1980s and 1990s. “The problem is that everyone’s thinking is still deeply set in traditional ideas. Everyone thinks soccer is just about getting results, competition, training, creating stars. ” Mr. Zhang has instead been encouraging schools to focus on fun and broad participation. That approach gives more children a break from the monotony of the classroom and will eventually bring out more future champions than an elitist,   approach, he argues. Some schools are trying his way. On a recent afternoon, the smog that often covers Beijing lifted and the children of Caoqiao Elementary School rushed onto the fields, shouting and squealing with delight. “This morning soccer had been canceled because of the smog,” said the principal, Lin Yanling. “But at midday I notified the kids that it was back on, and they all went crazy with relief. ”"
Tech Giants Seem Invincible. That Worries Lawmakers. - The New York Times,New York Times,Farhad Manjoo,2017-01-05,"In the technology industry, the sharks have never long been safe from the minnows. Over much of the last 40 years, the biggest players in tech  —   from IBM to   to Cisco to Yahoo  —   were eventually outmaneuvered by   that came out of nowhere. The dynamic is so dependable that it is often taken to be a kind of axiom. To grow large in this business is also to grow slow, blind and dumb, to become closed off from the very sources of innovation that turned you into a shark in the first place. Then, in the last half decade, something strange happened: The sharks began to get bigger and smarter. Nearly a year ago, I argued that we were witnessing a new era in the tech business, one that is typified less by the storied   in a garage than by a posse I like to call the Frightful Five: Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Alphabet, Google’s parent company. Together the Five compose a new superclass of American corporate might. For much of last year, their further rise and domination over the rest of the global economy looked not just plausible, but also maybe even probable. In 2017, much the same story remains, but there is a new wrinkle: The world’s governments are newly motivated to take on the tech giants. In the United States, Europe, Asia and South America, the Five find themselves increasingly arrayed against legal and regulatory powers, and often even against popular will. The precise nature of the fights varies by company and region, including the tax and antitrust investigations of Apple and Google in Europe and Donald J. Trump’s broad and often incoherent criticism of the Five for various alleged misdeeds. This is the story that will shape the contours of the next great era in tech: Five huge companies that can only get bigger are set against governments that increasingly see them as a clear threat to governing authority. So, happy New Year. Let’s start with some stats. In 2017, the Five are bigger than ever. As in 2016, they are half of the world’s 10 most valuable companies, when measured by stock market value. Their wealth stems from their control of the inescapable digital infrastructure on which much of the rest of the economy depends  —   mobile phones, social networks, the web, the cloud, retail and logistics, and the data and computing power required for future breakthroughs. Meanwhile, the Five are poised to jump beyond their corner of the lagoon. Over the last few years they have begun to set their sights on the biggest industries outside tech  —   on autos, health care, retail, transportation, entertainment and finance. The Five aren’t exactly immune to business cycles. Apple’s sales were flat last year, and after a monster 2016, Alphabet’s stock price hit a plateau. The Five also aren’t entirely safe from competition from   and one of the persistent features of the tech industry is that some of the most perilous threats to giants are the hardest to spot. Still, at the moment, thanks to smart acquisition strategies and a   outlook, the Five sure do look insulated from competition from   today’s most valuable tech upstarts, like Airbnb, Uber and Snap, could grow quite huge and still pose little threat to the collective fortunes of the Frightful Five. What has changed is public perception. For years, most of the Five enjoyed broad cultural good will. They were portrayed in the news media as forces of innovation and delight, as the best that American capitalism had to offer. The exceptions were Microsoft, which reached towering heights through corporate ruthlessness in the 1990s, and Amazon, which got under people’s skin for, among other things, making books cheaper and more widely accessible, thereby hurting bookstores. But generally people loved tech giants. They had gotten huge just the way you’re supposed to in America  —   by inventing new stuff that people love. And even their worst sins weren’t considered that bad. They weren’t causing environmental disasters. They weren’t selling cigarettes. They weren’t bringing the world to economic ruin through dangerous financial shenanigans. After I noted the Five’s growing invincibility last year, the biggest pushback I got from people at these companies had to do with the moniker I had given them: Why hadn’t I called them the Fabulous Five? Over the last year perception began to change. Familiarity breeds contempt as technology wormed deeper into our lives, it began to feel less like an unalloyed good and more like every other annoyance we have to deal with. Silicon Valley grew cloistered, missing people’s unease with the speed with which their innovations were changing our lives. When Apple took on the Federal Bureau of Investigation last year over access to a terrorist’s iPhone, many in tech sided with the company, but a majority of Americans thought Apple should give in. During the long presidential campaign, Mr. Trump said a lot of things that people in tech found ridiculous. He vowed to call on Bill Gates to help him shut down the parts of the internet that terrorists were using. He promised to force Apple to make iPhones in America. He suggested that The Washington Post was running critical stories about him because its owner, Jeff Bezos, was scared that Mr. Trump would pursue antitrust charges against Mr. Bezos’s main company, Amazon. Few in the tech industry supported Mr. Trump, but the industry’s antipathy seemed to matter little to the public. For years, most of the Frightful Five were given the benefit of the doubt as economic disrupters that were undercutting the cultural and economic power of the big industries that many people despised  —   entertainment giants, cable and phone companies, and the news media, among others. “During the periods where incumbents are battling disrupters, in general the U. S. has done a good job of encouraging disrupters,” said Julius Genachowski, the former chairman of the Federal Communications Commission who is now a partner at the Carlyle Group, a private equity firm. That describes the general direction of policy during the Obama administration. The tech giants were less giant for much of the Obama years, and various parts of the United States regulatory and legal infrastructure sought to protect and nurture them. During Mr. Genachowski’s term at the F. C. C. and then again during the term of his successor, Tom Wheeler, the commission passed rules favoring “network neutrality,” which declared that telecommunications companies could not favor some kinds of content online over others. It was a policy broadly favored by tech companies. But as Mr. Genachowski noted, as the disrupters grow, the dynamic often shifts. “The next part of the arc is that disrupters become very successful and in some ways turn into incumbents, and then you see two things  —   battles between incumbents and other incumbents, and a next generation of disrupters tackling incumbents,” he said. That’s where we are now. The Five have become incumbents themselves, and they are more likely to be treated as such by governments, who will look to both sides of the ledger  —   their benefits to society as well as their potential costs  —   when deciding how to police them. But there’s a twist: With the Five, unlike in previous eras of tech, it is not clear that there are many potential disrupters among today’s  . The battles for dominance in cloud services, artificial intelligence and data mining,   assistants,   cars, virtual reality and most every other Next Big Thing are being waged among the Five. That could likely raise the hackles of regulators and lawmakers even more and depending on your position on corporate power versus governmental power, things could be fabulous, or frightful."
"Chinese City Official Shoots 2 Others and Kills Himself, State Media Says - The New York Times",New York Times,Chris Buckley and Adam Wu,2017-01-05,"BEIJING  —   A city official in southwest China unleashed a barrage of gunfire on the city’s mayor and Communist Party secretary during a meeting on Wednesday, injuring them before fleeing and killing himself, the official news media reported. Privately owned guns are rare in China, because of a virtual ban on civilian use, and grisly attacks on officials by colleagues are also uncommon. So rumors of the shooting in Panzhihua, an industrial city in Sichuan Province, rippled quickly across the Chinese internet even before the local authorities confirmed the news. Panzhihua was built as part of Mao’s plans to relocate factories deep inland, where they would be protected from a feared war. But the violence in this isolated site was nonetheless an embarrassing breach of the efforts by China’s president, Xi Jinping, to remake officialdom into a clean, impeccably disciplined bureaucracy. Details were sparse, and there were no clues to the gunman’s motives. But the brief initial report in the state media sketched a scene of the head of the Panzhihua Land and Resources Bureau, Chen Zhongshu, bursting into a meeting at an exhibition center and opening fire on officials there. “The gunman stormed into the meeting, fired repeatedly at the main leading comrades of the city party committee and government and then fled,” said an online report by Sichuan Daily, an official provincial newspaper, citing the Panzhihua government press office. The suspect in the shooting, Mr. Chen, was found dead in the exhibition center. He had taken his own life, the report said without giving details. The mayor, Li Jianqin, and party secretary, Zhang Yan, were wounded and sent to the hospital, but their injuries were not considered   the report said. Mr. Zhang, the party secretary, has worked in Panzhihua since 2006, and the mayor, Mr. Li, has worked there since last year, according to Chinese news reports. Both officials went to meetings and inspection visits with Mr. Chen previously, but there was nothing in the earlier reports to suggest that trouble had been brewing. Photographs on Chinese news websites showed armored vehicles and paramilitary troops massed outside the exhibition center in the aftermath of the violence."
"Drop in Gang Violence Drove New York City Shootings Below 1,000 in 2016 - The New York Times",New York Times,Benjamin Mueller and Al Baker,2017-01-04,"A steep drop in gang violence last year drove shootings in New York City to the lowest number in at least a   Police Department data shows, a result of what police officials say has been a focus on gang takedowns and targeted arrests in some of the city’s roughest neighborhoods. The internal police data, obtained by The New York Times, paints a detailed portrait of the motives, locations and circumstances behind murders and shootings for the last two years.   shootings fell to 412 in 2016, from 560 the year before, according to the data, which tracked shootings and murders through Dec. 28 of each year.   killings dropped to 79 in 2016, from 129 in 2015. Those   helped push citywide shootings to a new low of 998 by year’s end, police officials said, down from 1, 138 in 2015. Murders also fell, to 335 from 352 the year before. The New York City police commissioner, James P. O’Neill, has noted the department’s efforts to push shootings below 1, 000 for the first time since at least the early 1990s, when the police began keeping similar records. Mr. O’Neill and Mayor Bill de Blasio were expected to discuss those efforts at a news conference in Brooklyn on Wednesday. Scores of gang takedowns this year, resulting in about 900 arrests, took violent people off the streets and made it more costly to engage in   crimes, police officials said. “Precision policing targets those people who are responsible for the violence, which in a significant amount of cases are gangs,” said Stephen P. Davis, the department’s chief spokesman. “By going after the gang members, arresting them, we recognize the resultant reduction in violence. ” Violent crime has been more persistent  in some communities, especially outside Manhattan. But the Police Department, in continuing to drive down crime even as it has pulled back from heavy   enforcement and aggressive tactics like    has shown the value of focusing resources on stopping serious crime, said David M. Kennedy, a professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. “New York City, in many ways, convinced the rest of the country that things like zero tolerance were the way to make communities safe,” he said. “And now it’s showing the country that you absolutely do not need to do that, you should not do it, and there are much, much better and less damaging ways to work with communities to produce public safety. ” The reductions in New York stand in stark contrast to some other cities, most notably Chicago, which had a sharp increase in murders and shootings in 2016 and ended the year with 762 homicides. The New York Police Department data offers a rare glimpse into the more granular ways that the department’s Detective Bureau tracks and classifies crime, as well as the   tangle of reasons that people are shot and killed. Shootings and murders dropped across almost every category of motive last year. Murders in which drugs were the primary motive, for example, dropped to 29 in 2016, from 42 the year before. But domestic killings rose slightly, to 57 last year from 49 in 2015. Criminologists believe gang enforcement can result in arrests of people who are also domestic offenders, but they say that domestic violence remains more difficult to prevent, because it can escalate inside homes, without the police being notified. Mr. Kennedy said that efforts in smaller jurisdictions across the country to respond to the earliest signs of domestic violence and to punish repeat offenders were showing results, but that those strategies would be more difficult to replicate in a city the size of New York. Fewer people were murdered with guns in 2016, but the number of people killed by cutting rose to 73, from 50 the year before. Murders and shootings on the street, in public housing and in commercial locations all dropped last year through Dec. 28. Murders on playgrounds climbed to 12, from three the year before, and also rose in dwellings and in vehicles. More broadly, murders indoors ticked up by 19, while outdoor murders fell by 49. About a third of shootings and murders occurred between 10 p. m. and 2 a. m. and more than half happened between 6 p. m. and 2 a. m. The biggest share of murders were motivated by what the police call a “dispute. ” Of those, the largest share had to do with words that were exchanged, followed by disputes over a man or woman, over money, and over a previous history. Five murders in 2016 were deemed to be motivated by a stare or a disrespectful act, two by gambling and two by road rage. Just under a third of the shooting cases last year were closed with an arrest, and 22 percent of the cases were closed because the police had exhausted all leads. Forty percent of the murder cases were closed with an arrest, and eight others were termed an exceptional clearance, a category that would include cases in which the person suspected of being the killer was murdered before an arrest was made."
How ‘Elites’ Became One of the Nastiest Epithets in American Politics - The New York Times,New York Times,Beverly Gage,2017-01-07,"Our new president is a    billionaire Ivy League graduate, a real estate tycoon, a TV star and a son of inherited wealth. But he is no longer, by his own calculations, a member of the “elite. ” Nor are the men (and the few women) now joining his inner circle  —     and corporate executives, Harvard and Yale alumni, Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and Goldman Sachs bankers. The true elite apparently sits elsewhere, among those who, in Sarah Palin’s notable 2008 formulation, think “that they’re  —   I guess  —   better than anyone else. ” As an adjective, the word “elite” still conveys something positive, even aspirational: elite athlete, elite model, elite travel services. But as a noun, embodied by actual living people, it has become one of the nastiest epithets in American politics. “Elites have taken all the upside for themselves and pushed the downside to the   and   Americans,” complains Trump’s adviser Steve Bannon (of Harvard, Goldman Sachs and Hollywood). In this formulation, elites are a destructive, condescending collective, plotting against the beleaguered masses outside their ranks. And in these attacks, the   and his team are deploying one of the most effective partisan political stereotypes of the modern age. For most of American history,   sentiment was a matter of up versus down, not left versus right. But about half a century ago, the conservative movement set out to claim   politics as its own. That meant redefining the term away from class and toward culture, where the “elite” could be identified by its liberal ideas, coastal real estate and highbrow consumer preferences. The   Club for Growth captured this type in a famous 2004 attack ad, instructing the Democrat Howard Dean to “take his           New York         freak show back to Vermont where it belongs. ” Trump adjusted the formula for the hot topics of the 2016 campaign. “I was on the right side of that issue, as you know, with the people,” he boasted after Brexit, adding that “Hillary, as always, stood with the elites. ” His complaints against “political correctness” conjure a world of absurdist campus politics, where overprivileged students squabble over gender pronouns and the fine points of racial victimization. “Media elites” come in for special attack, cordoned off in pens to be mocked and jeered at during rallies, labeled both liars and incompetents. But Trump has also ventured beyond mere   turning the 2016 election into a competition between knowledge systems: the      “people” versus the    “elites. ” His campaign insisted for months that pollsters and technocrats and media would be proven wrong by his electoral success. The fact that he did win dealt a blow to an entire worldview, one in which empirical inquiry and   were supposed to triumph in the end. The question, now, is whether it’s possible to run an executive branch based on hostility toward experts and professionals of all political stripes  —   and how many billionaires and Ivy Leaguers Trump can appoint before this rhetorical pose begins to break down altogether. The notion that distant elites might be conspiring against the people comes straight from the Founding Fathers, whose Declaration of Independence lamented the “long train of abuses and usurpations” inflicted upon ordinary Americans by an arrogant British king. From there on, United States history might be seen as a repeating cycle of   revolt. The Jacksonians rebelled against the Founders’ aristocratic pretensions. Northern “free labor” went to war against the oligarchical slavocracy. And the Populist revolts of the late 19th century adapted this story to modern capitalism, with farmers and laborers rebelling against robber barons, bankers,   experts and   professionals. The first historians to study those Populists described them as heroic crusaders, champions of the “people” against the “powers. ” But by the middle of the 20th century, alarmed by the rise of fascism and homegrown demagogues like Senator Joseph McCarthy, a new generation of scholars took a more anxious view of the   spirit. In his 1955 book “The Age of Reform,” Richard Hofstadter dismissed the Populists as   provincial   the latent fascists of their day. Eight years later, his “  in American Life” documented a dangerous suspicion of “the critical mind” that seemed to course through the national culture. From his perspective, the 1952 election captured everything wrong with American political life, with Dwight Eisenhower’s “philistinism” winning over Adlai Stevenson’s “intellect. ” Hofstadter did not usually describe his ideal intellectually minded citizens as members of an “elite. ” That word conveyed something different  —   a ruling class that held direct political and economic power. The most famous articulation of this view came from the sociologist C. Wright Mills, in his 1956 assessment of America’s “power elite. ” “They rule the big corporations,” Mills wrote. “They run the machinery of the state and claim its prerogatives. They direct the military establishment. ” In Mills’s view, these people were tied together not by culture or ideology but by their positions at the helms of large,    institutions. As individuals, they might be Republicans or Democrats, and might live in Ohio or California. The point was that they were in charge of things. But that vision never gained much traction in mainstream politics, where a more partisan, targeted definition was starting to emerge. William F. Buckley Jr. carved out some essentials in his first book, “God and Man at Yale,” drawing a neat distinction between respectable   men like himself and the socialistic eggheads of the professoriate. Ronald Reagan chose the term “elite” to bring it all together in his famed 1964 speech, “A Time for Choosing,” delivered on behalf of the Republican presidential candidate Barry Goldwater. “This is the issue of this election,” he said: “whether we believe in our capacity for   or whether we abandon the American Revolution and confess that a little intellectual elite in a   capitol can plan our lives for us better than we can plan them ourselves. ” Lyndon Johnson won that election in a blowout, but Reagan’s vision of a smug and detached liberal elite helped spark the oncoming “culture wars,” pitting a supposedly indignant Middle America against the liberal snobs of the coasts. By the 1990s, with the rise of   media stars like Rush Limbaugh and Bill O’Reilly, bashing the “liberal elite” had become a favorite blood sport of the American right. Despite all the abuse hurled their way, some “liberal elites” have accepted at least part of their detractors’ critique, particularly on the progressive left. It was during Bill Clinton’s presidency that the social critic Christopher Lasch published “The Revolt of the Elites and the Betrayal of Democracy,” which mourned that “   liberals” had turned into “petulant,   intolerant” scolds, thoroughly out of touch with the concerns of Middle America. Since then, the torch has passed to a younger generation of writers, including MSNBC’s Chris Hayes, whose 2012 “Twilight of the Elites” called for rethinking the entire ethos of liberal “meritocracy”  —   a system, he argued, that tends to fuel   and incompetence at the top while offering little but contempt and dim prospects for those at the bottom. So as 2017 begins, we find ourselves in a strange and uncertain political moment. Antipathy toward a wealthy, preening managerial class seems to be gaining popularity across the political spectrum  —   and, oddly, to have helped elect a wealthy, preening incoming president. Meanwhile, both liberal and conservative “elites” are scrambling to figure out what happens if the   continues to reject basic political norms and even routine intelligence briefings. Under a Trump presidency, such “elites” may have no choice but to attempt a radical redefinition of their role in American life. Otherwise, the man in the White House will do it for them."
"10 Engaging Proposals, From the Rooftop to the Subway - The New York Times",New York Times,Vincent M. Mallozzi,2017-01-07,"“Will you marry me?” Hundreds of thousands of potential grooms and brides pop that question every year, and yet the logistics of delivering that momentous phrase  —   where to do it, when to do it and how much of a surprise should it be  —   remains among the most important decisions anyone planning on getting married has to make. Some of the couples whose wedding announcements were featured in the pages of The New York Times this past year, or whose weddings The Times learned about, got engaged in unusual spots  —   from a Manhattan rooftop to a subway construction site below the city’s streets  —   and one proposal even involved seeking advice from President Obama. And, of course, at least several can now be found on YouTube. Here are 10 of our most engaging stories of the year. Mr. Litman, who first began dating Ms. Michelis in the eighth grade at the Horace Mann School in the Riverdale section of the Bronx, proposed in November 2015 in Montauk, N. Y. the entire scene captured by a drone hovering above on an unusually warm   day at the beach. With waves rushing the shore and the Montauk Point Lighthouse in the distance, Ms. Michelis can be seen from a windblown aerial view playfully running beneath the drone before turning back to Mr. Litman. As she runs closer, he drops to his knee, engagement ring in hand. Momentarily shocked at the sight, she drops her purse as he asks her to marry him, and the two then fall into each other’s arms. “The first thing that came to my mind was, I can’t wait to show it to our kids,” Ms. Michelis said. They were married Oct. 8. The couple first met in fall 2011 while working on the digital team for Mr. Obama’s   campaign. After the president’s victory, Mr. Fallsgraff became the digital director of Organizing for Action, the nonprofit organization that manages the social media and digital accounts for Mr. Obama. In 2015, Mr. Fallsgraff and his team were filming a video with Mr. Obama at a hotel in Washington during the Organizing for Action Spring Organizing Summit. Knowing he was planning to leave in June, Mr. Fallsgraff took the opportunity to talk with the president, and told him that he was bent on proposing (which he would do three months later). “You got a rock picked out and all that?” he recalled Mr. Obama asking. Mr. Fallsgraff told him he had yet to get the ring and asked if the president had any advice. Mr. Obama suggested that Mr. Fallsgraff get help from someone Ms. Wilson trusted and who understood her taste. When Mr. Fallsgraff suggested that he was thinking of asking Ms. Wilson’s best friend, the president responded, “I think that’s the right strategy, but you’ve got to swear her to secrecy. ” The next time Mr. Fallsgraff saw Ms. Wilson’s best friend, he pulled her aside. “I told her I had a mission for her from the president of the United States,” he said. Mission accomplished. Mr. Fallsgraff and Ms. Wilson were married July 3. The couple, who met in June 2015 through a dating app called the League, went to Paris six months later for a New Year’s celebration. While at a restaurant there, Mr. Purcell ordered a bottle of Champagne for what he thought was 110 euros, the equivalent of about $119. But when the bill arrived after dinner, he realized he had mistakenly ordered a bottle of vintage Champagne  —   the 2003 Dom Pérignon Rosé  —   at a cost of 1, 100 euros, a total at the time of roughly $1, 195. In May, Mr. Purcell invited Ms. Bui to the rooftop of his apartment building in San Francisco to enjoy the unobstructed   view that included the Golden Gate Bridge. As they took in the view, Mr. Purcell surprised Ms. Bui by breaking out an expensive bottle of the same vintage Champagne he had mistakenly bought in Paris. It was all a part of a special occasion, he told her, and then he surprised her again, this time with an engagement ring. They were married Nov. 26. The couple, who met in 2007 while they were working for the New York City Department of City Planning, became engaged in May 2014, when Mr. Meagher proposed while they were on a tour of the construction site of the 86th Street station, part of the Second Avenue subway. The tour, conducted below street level, included residents who live near the new subway line as well as officials with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. “We’re both passionate about cities and infrastructure,” Mr. Meagher said. And about each other, as the group learned when Mr. Meagher, wearing a hard hat and an orange safety vest, got down on one knee and asked Ms. Grossman, who was wearing the same gear, to marry him. Gasps, then applause, broke out among the tour group, as well as from the bride’s parents, who had also shown up for the occasion. They were married Jan. 9. The couple met in August 2014 during a performance of the Broadway musical “A Gentleman’s Guide to Love and Murder. ” Mr. Fogelman, who was there alone, tried to move to an empty seat next to Ms. Phillips to get a better view of the stage. “Not in the middle of a song,” said Ms. Phillips, who was there with a friend. Mr. Fogelman waited until after the song to switch seats, and at intermission, he apologized profusely to her for his poor theater etiquette. She forgave him, he sat down next to her, and they began talking. They were soon dating, and in August 2015, while sitting in those same seats, Mr. Fogelman turned to Ms. Phillips at intermission and proposed. “It turned out to be a wonderful   at the theater,” Ms. Phillips said, “one that I will never forget. ” They were married Sept. 4. Mr. Whelden, a plumber in Boston who sings with two professional   touring a cappella groups (Five O’Clock Shadow and Overboard) proposed during his performance at a New Year’s Eve concert in Rockport, Mass. The crowd roared when he sang “Fall in Love,” a song he wrote for his future bride that included the words “will you marry me. ” “It was the most amazing, romantic proposal I could’ve ever imagined,” Ms. Delaney said. They were married May 7. The couple, who were both living in Park Slope, Brooklyn, met through OkCupid in early 2011. They immediately became a couple. In July 2015, they moved into a   together in Bay Ridge. On their first day in the new place, Ms. Roth put in motion her proposal while Ms. Marini was at work. She was hiding when Ms. Marini returned, and watched her follow a path of lighted candles to a makeshift bed where Chinese food boxes had been placed across the floor, leading to a smaller box. (“Melina had always idealized the movie trope of people moving into a new apartment that’s not yet furnished, and having to eat Chinese food on the floor, ” Ms. Roth explained.) When Ms. Marini opened the smaller box, which contained an engagement ring, she started sobbing. Along with the ring was a note that said: “Will you marry me? Check yes or no. ” Ms. Marini checked “yes,” and she and Ms. Roth, who came out of hiding, cried in each other’s arms. “I’m not the type of person who wants to see ‘Will you marry me?’ splashed across a Jumbotron,” Ms. Marini said. “This was much more intimate to me, and much more meaningful. ” They were married Aug. 6. The couple met on March 11, 2005, while shooting pool in what Ms. Powell described as a dim, smoky bar on Avenue B in Manhattan. They shared several beers, then a single kiss outside the bar. Mr. Albertson, 23 at the time, was beyond taken with her, but Ms. Powell, then 20, was not quite ready for a serious relationship. They settled on becoming friends. Ms. Powell eventually married another man, and fell out of touch with Mr. Albertson. By May 2014, however, Ms. Powell was divorced and dating Mr. Albertson, often telling him that the word “marriage” now frightened her. On March 11, 2015, 10 years to the day they met, they were back on Avenue B and heading into that same dim, smoky bar when Ms. Powell looked down and saw a huge chalk mark indicating the spot where she had first kissed him. She turned to find him down on one knee, holding her engagement ring. “I was freaking out,” she said. “I just started crying and hugging him. ” He proposed but managed to avoid scaring her by leaving out the word “marriage. ” “I was wondering,” he said, “if you wanted to hang out with me forever. ” They were married March 11. Mr. Turke, who proposed in February, chose to give his future bride a full day of   bliss, rather than a single moment of happiness. An hour after he sneaked out of their apartment at 6 a. m. he called her with instructions to go into their kitchen, where she found a huge bouquet of white lilies with several notes that he had left for her, including one that read, “Today is the day that we get engaged,” and another that read, “Enjoy the moments ahead of you, have fun and say ‘yes. ’” What ensued was a dizzying series of events that first took Ms. Helmling to the NoMad Hotel in Manhattan, where she found her three best friends waiting at a breakfast table. A waiter then gave them a note with instructions to walk across the street to a spa, where they each enjoyed Champagne and a massage before being whisked away for manicures and pedicures. Later in the day, Ms. Helmling was chauffeured over the George Washington Bridge to a small park in New Jersey overlooking the Hudson River  —   the spot where Mr. Turke had first asked her out in September 2013. “When she arrived, we hugged and cried and she told me all about her day,” said Mr. Turke, who also presented a slide show that included every photo that had both of them in it, arranged in chronological order as a way of telling their story. Then he proposed, and Ms. Helmling cried some more. They were married Nov. 13. The couple met online in 2008. At the time, Mr. Stucky was living in Somerville, Mass. and going through a divorce. They were soon dating, but their relationship began to sputter. In the space of three years, each of them proposed to the other, and each was soundly rejected. In June 2014, Ms. Mathiowetz was partying with friends in New York when she consumed too many psychedelic mushrooms. The episode left her paralyzed for nearly six hours  —   and longing again for Mr. Stucky, whom she was no longer seeing. “I can’t believe I haven’t been telling you every day that I love you,” she called to tell him the moment she got back on her feet. Mr. Stucky was feeling much the same way, as he too had had a   experience, he said, a nightmare in which he was on his knees and looking up at a stranger who was telling him he had only 24 hours to live. Completely shaken, he awoke and began taking into account all the things in life that mattered most to him, and quickly realized that Ms. Mathiowetz was at the top of that list. Those shared experiences brought them back together, and in January 2015, Mr. Stucky proposed to Ms. Mathiowetz, for a second time, during a weekend trip at a    in Portsmouth, N. H. This time, she accepted. They were married June 11."
"For a Mother With Big Dreams, Two Forbidden Words: ‘I Can’t’ - The New York Times",New York Times,John Grippe,2017-01-04,"Alicia Rivera, a    single mother with four children and big dreams, must budget her money and her time wisely. “I got my kids,” Ms. Rivera said. “I don’t want to waste my time. ” Ms. Rivera and her children  —   Joaquin, 17 Nelson, 16 Alyssa, 11 and Rafael, 2  —   live in a   apartment in the Bronx, near the southern tip of the Bronx River Parkway. The past few years have sometimes been overwhelming for her as she tries to raise her children by herself, get an education and lay the foundation for a professional career. When she was seven months pregnant with Rafael, Ms. Rivera injured her back while working as a home health aide. Soon after he was born, she switched to another job, helping   people navigate complicated real estate and tax forms and other paperwork. Ms. Rivera makes about $100 every week. She also receives $216 a month in Supplemental Security Income and $506 a month in food stamps. With a monthly rent of $308, she needs to keep a frugal budget. But Ms. Rivera has a plan. She is on track to receive an associate degree from Plaza College in April. Her goal is to then earn a bachelor’s degree and a master’s degree, both in business, from Metropolitan College of New York. She dreams of opening a dance studio in the Bronx. Ms. Rivera grew up in the Bronx with a mother who could not afford to send her to dance classes. But she loved dancing in front of the family’s television as they watched the   variety show “Sábado Gigante. ” “And you see these kids dancing, and you see me dancing in the living room, too,” Ms. Rivera said. “I used to wear my mom’s makeup, her heels. ” Ms. Rivera passed on her love of dancing to her children, especially Joaquin, who leads a dance team at his school, the Knowledge and Power Preparatory Academy, near Fordham University in the Bronx. She watched him at a dance rehearsal at the school, and she said the students’ moves reminded her of the “Step Up” movie series. “Made me laugh, made me have a good time,” she said. “I felt like joining them,” she said, beaming. At times, Ms. Rivera has struggled to balance her obligations at home, school and work. As she devoted more time to her studies, her son Nelson, who attends the same academy as Joaquin, started having trouble at school. A counselor there contacted her, saying that Nelson did not want to go to class. The counselor referred her to the Family Assistance Program, which soon referred them to the Children’s Aid Society, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. At Children’s Aid, Ms. Rivera said, she learned how to improve her parenting. She said she used to get frustrated and yell at Nelson when he struggled to get up and get ready in the morning. A counselor told her that yelling at him was not going to solve the problem. Therapy sessions with the family also made it clear that her sons needed their own rooms. Ms. Rivera said she started to notice positive changes at home after several months of therapy. Her older sons now have their own rooms. Alyssa agreed to share a room with her mother and Rafael. Her elder sons are more focused now. Nelson comes to her with problems, not letting them linger, and they work them out together. Joaquin is starting to research colleges. The Children’s Aid Society also provided Ms. Rivera $413 in Neediest funds to replace her sons’ broken beds with new ones. Nelson and a friend put them together, she said. While still attending school, Nelson is taking some online courses, which cost $49 a month. Ms. Rivera wants to withdraw Nelson to take online classes full time so that she can monitor his schoolwork more carefully. In addition to opening a dance school, Ms. Rivera wants to start a business similar to her present workplace. While the family has learned to resolve problems, Ms. Rivera refuses to lower her expectations. She bristles when she hears her children or their friends say they cannot do something. “Don’t say, ‘I can’t,’” she said. “Joaquin never says, ‘I can’t,’ because he hears me. ” That is one way she lays the foundation for her children’s future. Ms. Rivera said Alyssa was struggling one day with homework. So she took time out of her own schoolwork, encouraged her daughter and patiently walked her through the steps of writing a   essay. “It took her three hours, and when she was done, I said, ‘You see? You could do it. ’”"
Senate Republicans Open Fight Over Obama Health Law - The New York Times,New York Times,Thomas Kaplan and Glenn Thrush,2017-01-05,"WASHINGTON  —   Congress opened for battle over the Affordable Care Act on Wednesday as Republicans pushed immediately forward to repeal the health care law and President Obama made a rare trip to Capitol Hill to defend it. The bitterness that has long marked the fight intensified as Republicans seized the opportunity to make good on a central campaign promise to get rid of the law, a pledge reinforced on Wednesday by Vice   Mike Pence, who met with House Republicans not far from where the president gathered with Democrats. The Affordable Care Act, Mr. Obama’s signature health care law, has created online insurance marketplaces, offered new protections to people seeking health insurance, and provided coverage to millions of people near the poverty line through expanded Medicaid. Health policy experts say that system could collapse if Republicans cut off funds for the expanded coverage and end penalties for people who go without health insurance. “The American people voted decisively for a better future for health care in this country,” Mr. Pence said, “and we are determined to give them that. ” He said that   Donald J. Trump would use his executive authority to help make the transition away from the health care law, but did not offer specifics. Democrats vowed aggressive resistance, however, and said they would not participate in drawing up a replacement for the law after the swift efforts to unravel it. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the new Democratic leader, playing off Mr. Trump’s campaign slogan, said repealing the law would “make America sick again. ” Republicans are using a procedural approach that will allow them to repeal substantial parts of the health care law without Democrats’ being able to mount a filibuster in the Senate. By a vote of 51 to 48 on Wednesday, the Senate took the first step, agreeing to take up a budget resolution, or blueprint, that would clear the way for legislation repealing major provisions of the  law. But even as Republicans spoke of moving quickly to repeal the law, it remained far less clear how and when they would go about replacing it. Senate debate on the budget resolution is expected to continue for several days, and the House plans to take up the measure once the Senate has approved it. As Republicans charged ahead, both sides seemed cognizant of the possible fallout from unwinding the law, which has become deeply enmeshed with America’s health care system and has provided insurance for about 20 million people. Mr. Trump weighed in with several Twitter posts. He advised that Republicans needed to “be careful in that the Dems own the failed Obamacare disaster,” and added, “Don’t let the Schumer clowns out of this web. ” Mr. Trump predicted that the health care law would “fall of its own weight. ” Representative Chris Collins of New York, a Republican who is one of Mr. Trump’s top supporters in Congress and is part of his transition team, said it was important to be sure that Democrats bear responsibility for the failings of the health care law. Republicans point out that premiums have risen and that consumers in many places have fewer choices of insurers. “We have to make sure we keep reminding America, we are repealing it because it failed, we are repealing it because they all but demanded that we repeal it,” Mr. Collins said. “And that was a key piece of Donald Trump’s campaign. ” But as Republicans expressed eagerness to repeal the law, they acknowledged that replacing it would take more time. It is also unclear how insurance companies will react during this period and whether they will continue to offer the marketplace plans that millions of people have come to rely on. “There will naturally be a reasonable transition period,” said Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas. “You can’t adopt new reforms all at once. ” Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Senate Republican, noted that it had taken six years to get into “the ditch we find ourselves in now. ” “When your truck or car is in a ditch, the first thing you need to do is get out of the ditch,” Mr. Cornyn said. “And sometimes that takes a lot of hard work. ” To that, Senator Debbie Stabenow, Democrat of Michigan, parried that when a car goes into a ditch, “the first thing I don’t do is dismantle the car. ” “That doesn’t help me get anywhere in terms of transportation,” she said. Democrats signaled little interest in helping Republicans determine what to do after repealing major parts of the health care law. Mr. Schumer predicted that in a year, Republicans would “regret that they came out so fast out of the box. ” He said Democrats would consider working on a replacement only after Republicans presented their own plan. “If you are repealing, show us what you’ll replace it with first,” Mr. Schumer said. “Then we’ll look at what you have and see what we can do. ” Later, Mr. Schumer said of Mr. Trump, “It’s his and their responsibility, plain and simple  —   name calling isn’t going to get anything done. ” He added, “They really need to calm things down a little. ” Speaker Paul D. Ryan tried to offer assurance that no change in coverage would be abrupt. “The point is, in 2017, we don’t want people to be caught with nothing,” he said. “We want to make sure that there’s an orderly transition so that the rug is not pulled out from under the families who are currently struggling under Obamacare while we bring relief. ” Mr. Obama huddled with congressional Democrats for about 90 minutes in what was billed by the White House as a strategy session to forge a unified Democratic response to the Republicans’ rollback effort. In reality, the session was essentially a   party for a man who passed his signature legislative accomplishment under   majorities in Congress and a “pep rally” for Affordable Care Act defenders, in the words of an attendee, Representative Hank Johnson, Democrat of Georgia. The gathering, which could be Mr. Obama’s last trip to the halls of Congress that have been the site of alternating triumph and defeat, had a     air, with numerous Democratic lawmakers, including Mr. Johnson, sneaking out to attend to business more pressing than hearing the president’s words. Mr. Obama, for his part, did not ask his allies to block all efforts to alter the law, but warned Democrats against “rescuing” Republicans by defecting on votes that would dismantle it. The president provided an array of arguments for keeping the Affordable Care Act and offered a mild mea culpa for his shortcomings as a salesman over the years. Senator Jeff Merkley, Democrat of Oregon, said, “He acknowledged the failures in selling the law in its entirety to the American people. ”"
The Parliamentary Tactic That Could Obliterate Obamacare - The New York Times,New York Times,Robert Pear,2017-01-05,"WASHINGTON  —   Republicans hope to repeal major parts of the Affordable Care Act using an expedited procedure known as budget reconciliation. The process is sometimes called arcane, but it has been used often in the past 35 years to write some of the nation’s most important laws. “Reconciliation is probably the most potent budget enforcement tool available to Congress for a large portion of the budget,” the Congressional Research Service, a nonpartisan arm of Congress, has said. Here is a primer. Q. What is the budget reconciliation process? A. It is a way for Congress to speed action on legislation that changes taxes or spending, especially spending for entitlement programs like Medicare and Medicaid. Although conceived primarily as a way to reduce federal budget deficits, it has also been used to cut taxes and to create programs that increase spending  —   changes that can raise deficits. In the Senate, a reconciliation bill can ordinarily be passed with a simple majority. For other bills, a   majority is often needed to limit debate and move to a final vote. Q. Why is it called reconciliation? A. The term originated in the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, which was intended to give Congress more control over the budget process by allowing lawmakers to set overall levels of spending and revenue. The process begins with a budget blueprint, a resolution that guides Congress but is not presented to the president for a signature or veto. It recommends federal revenue, deficit, debt and spending levels in areas like defense, energy, education and health care. The resolution may direct one or more committees to develop legislation to achieve specified budgetary results. By adopting these proposals, Congress can change existing laws so that actual revenue and spending are brought into line with  —   reconciled with  —   policies in the budget resolution. Q. How has reconciliation been used? A. Since 1980, Congress has completed action on 24 budget reconciliation bills. Twenty became law. Four were vetoed. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 was a vehicle for much of the “Reagan revolution. ” It squeezed savings out of Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps, the school lunch program, farm subsidies, student loans, welfare and jobless benefits, among many other programs. In 1996, Congress reversed six decades of social welfare policy, eliminating the individual entitlement to cash assistance for the nation’s poorest children and giving each state a lump sum of federal money with vast discretion over its use. Those changes were made in a reconciliation bill, pushed by Republicans but signed by President Bill Clinton. Congress reduced deficits with another reconciliation bill, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. That law also created the Children’s Health Insurance Program, primarily for uninsured children in   families. On the same day in 1997, Mr. Clinton signed a separate reconciliation bill that cut taxes. The Bush tax cuts were adopted in reconciliation bills signed by President George W. Bush in 2001 and 2003. On several occasions, Congress has increased assistance to   working families by increasing the   tax credit in reconciliation bills. Congress also made changes to the Affordable Care Act in a reconciliation bill passed immediately after President Obama signed the health care overhaul in 2010. Later, when Republicans controlled both houses of Congress, they passed a reconciliation bill to eviscerate the Affordable Care Act, but Mr. Obama vetoed the bill in January 2016. Republicans say that measure will provide a template or starting point for their efforts to undo the health care law this year, with support from   Donald J. Trump, who calls the law “an absolute disaster. ” Q. How does the reconciliation process work in the Senate? A. In the House, leaders of the majority party can usually control what happens if their members stick together. In the Senate, by contrast, one member or a handful of senators can often derail the leaders’ plans. The reconciliation process enhances the power of the majority party and its leaders. Senate debate on a reconciliation bill is normally limited to 20 hours, so it cannot be filibustered on the Senate floor. The Senate has a special rule to prevent abuse of the budget reconciliation process. The rule, named for former Senator Robert C. Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia, generally bars use of the procedure to consider legislation that has no effect on spending, taxes and deficits. The Senate parliamentarian normally decides whether particular provisions violate the Byrd rule, but the Senate can waive the rule with a   majority. Q. What does this mean for the Affordable Care Act? A. Republicans hope to use the   procedure of budget reconciliation to repeal or nullify provisions of the law that affect spending and taxes. They could, for example, eliminate penalties imposed on people who go without insurance and on larger employers who do not offer coverage to employees. They could use a reconciliation bill to eliminate tens of billions of dollars provided each year to states that have expanded eligibility for Medicaid. And they could use it to repeal subsidies for private health insurance coverage obtained through the public marketplaces known as exchanges. Republicans could also repeal a number of taxes and fees imposed on certain   people and on health insurers and manufacturers of   prescription drugs and medical devices: tax increases that help offset the cost of the insurance coverage expansions. Those provisions were all rolled back in the reconciliation bill Mr. Obama vetoed last January. That bill did not touch insurance market standards established in the Affordable Care Act, which do not directly cost the government money or raise taxes. The standards stipulate, for example, that insurers cannot deny coverage or charge higher premiums because of a person’s   conditions. Insurers must allow parents to keep children on their policies until the age of 26, and they cannot charge women higher rates than men, as they often did in the past. Such provisions are politically popular, but it is not clear how they could remain in force without the coverage expansions that help insurers afford such regulations. Without an effective requirement for people to carry insurance, and without subsidies, supporters of the health law say many healthy people would go without coverage, knowing they could obtain it if they became ill and needed it. Democrats say they will fight to preserve the law after Mr. Obama leaves office. Recent history shows that lobbying and public pressure can sometimes make a difference, altering the votes of individual lawmakers and changing the contents of a reconciliation bill."
"In Republicans’ Ethics Office Gambit, a Spectacle of Tweets and Retreats - The New York Times",New York Times,Carl Hulse,2017-01-05,"WASHINGTON  —   Majorities in Congress often overreach, but usually not on the very first day. House Republicans, on the verge of a Washington takeover as the new Congress convened Tuesday, couldn’t stop themselves from trying to dilute the power of a despised ethics watchdog as their first order of business. In the process, they created an unsightly spectacle that pretty much ruined an   celebration of unified Republican government, undermined their own leadership and perhaps foretold the shape of things to come. House Republicans take a stand on a contentious issue, Donald J. Trump turns to Twitter to break with House Republicans, then Republicans frantically reverse course. “Mr. Trump campaigned that he was going to drain the swamp, and here we are on Day 1 trying to fill the swamp,” Representative Walter B. Jones, Republican of North Carolina, said after he and his colleagues hurriedly jettisoned a plan seen as a brazen attempt to weaken an independent ethics office that some felt had been unfair to lawmakers. “That is not a good way to start. ” Deluged by angry phone calls and bad headlines, chagrined Republican officials say they were well on their way to abandoning the ethics revisions adopted Monday night in a   party meeting before Mr. Trump weighed in via Twitter and suggested that the overhaul shouldn’t be a top priority, urging Republicans to focus instead on taxes and health care. But the final decision did come after the  ’s Twitter posts, underscoring his sway over House Republicans who had moved ahead despite objections and warnings about the optics of the change from Speaker Paul D. Ryan and Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the majority leader. House Republicans might have amusedly applauded Mr. Trump’s cutting tweets when they were aimed at the news media and other common foes, but they found them measurably less funny when the criticisms were directed their way, raising alarms among Republicans about his power to corral them via social media. Following the decision to reverse course, several lawmakers were quietly fretting that Mr. Trump’s megaphone was much more powerful than they had realized. Other Republicans both on and off Capitol Hill were wondering how the   proposal got as far as it did, given the stated reservations of Mr. Ryan and Mr. McCarthy among others. They said it did not bode well that the rank and file was so willing to ignore leadership on such a potentially critical matter, demonstrating once again how hard it can be to manage the House Republicans even when the party is set to control both Capitol Hill and the White House. Mr. Ryan had already headed off an earlier rules change that was deemed potentially embarrassing: a proposal to let lawmakers resume funding of pet projects through designated “earmarks” as long as the money went to public entities. Abuse of earmarks was one of the main sources of congressional corruption that led to tighter ethics rules and a ban on such spending, and Mr. Ryan and his allies believed that a quick move to restore them so soon after Mr. Trump’s election would not send the proper signal. But Mr. Ryan has promised to revisit both the earmark issue and the revisions to the Office of Congressional Ethics later this year. The ethics office was created in 2008 at the urging of Representative Nancy Pelosi, the California Democrat who was then the House speaker. This was in response to criticism that the Select Committee on Ethics, comprising lawmakers from both parties, was ineffective, given a string of   corruption cases and other breakdowns such as a scandal involving teenage House pages. Lawmakers from both parties were against the office then, as well as now, and would much prefer to be judged by their peers  —   politicians currently serving in the House who might be more sympathetic  —   as opposed to a more discrete board and staff. But in moving ahead with the rules change on a strictly partisan basis, Republicans opened the door to Democrats berating them for the proposal, even though a significant number of Democrats are just as unhappy with the ethics office. It was similar to a move House Republicans made in 2005 when they used the   rules package to weaken the ethics committee itself after a series of rebukes against Tom DeLay, the majority leader. That decision sparked an outcry from Democrats and watchdog groups that helped Democrats regain the majority the next year with a message that Republicans were fostering a culture of corruption. “I think it is always better to do changes to the ethics process in a bipartisan manner,” said John Feehery, a former top Republican aide in the House. “It protects you from political attacks. ” The tussle over the ethics office is just one illustration of how Mr. Trump and his outsider ideas could clash with his own party in Congress. Mr. Trump has vowed to move forward with a proposal to impose term limits on Congress, and many in the party are not happy with that idea. Other sources of friction are bound to emerge, given his campaign message about shaking up Washington. “I just could not believe that the Congress does not understand that, if anything, we need to bring sunshine in,” Mr. Jones said. House Republicans may understand that idea a little bit better now."
Ivanka Trump’s New Washington Home Once Belonged to a Putin Foe - The New York Times,New York Times,Julie Hirschfeld Davis,2017-01-23,"WASHINGTON  —   Ivanka Trump, who is weighing a prominent role in her father’s administration, is planning to move with her family to a mansion in the exclusive Kalorama section of Washington, two people familiar with the decision said Wednesday. The house was previously owned by a   financier with extensive investments in Russia and ties to a Russian opposition leader. Ms. Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, a close adviser to   Donald J. Trump who is expected to be an influential voice in the administration, have chosen a      house just around the corner from President Obama’s new home. The newly renovated house, with its sleekly modern décor, sold for $5. 5 million in December, the people said, insisting on anonymity because the transaction was private. The home was previously owned by Dan K. Rapoport and his wife, Irina, according to property records filed with the District of Columbia. Neither responded to emailed requests for comment. Ms. Trump’s relocation plans, first reported by Washingtonian magazine, are the latest evidence that she and Mr. Kushner will remain major players in Mr. Trump’s administration. Both played crucial roles in his presidential bid and have wielded outsize power during his transition. People close to the couple declined to comment on their impending move, as did William F. X. Moody, a   at Washington Fine Properties, who first disclosed the deal. But in the neighborhood where they are planning to live  —     of ambassadors and prominent figures on the Washington social circuit  —   residents have been buzzing about their    neighbors. “Everybody’s atwitter about it,” said Tony Podesta, chairman of the Podesta Group, a top Washington lobbying firm. “I’ve been getting lots of emails saying, ‘Here we go again,’ ” Mr. Podesta said, alluding to the burst of local mayhem that attended the decision by Mr. Obama and his family to rent a   home in the neighborhood after they leave the White House. “It will be great to have them as neighbors,” Mr. Podesta said of Ms. Trump and Mr. Kushner, who have three children. The white house on Tracy Place where Ms. Trump and Mr. Kushner plan to live with their children is just around the corner from the Obamas’ luxurious   home on Belmont Road, which has been undergoing extensive renovations directed by the Secret Service to fortify it for their arrival. A security checkpoint is expected to be built at the intersection of Tracy and Belmont before Mr. Obama moves in, residents said. There was no sign of Ms. Trump or her husband at the house on Wednesday afternoon. But the property was a flurry of activity, as workers and painters filed in and out past television reporters staked out on the sidewalk and   speculated about their new neighbors. John Damgard, who has owned a house on the block since 1971, said his new neighbors could expect to be welcomed “with open arms,” even by the neighborhood’s Democrats. “It’s quiet, it’s private, and they’ll be graciously received,” Mr. Damgard said. The house was home for several decades to Renee Zlotnick Kraft, a Washington fur heiress and socialite, who frequently opened its doors for events and even occasionally rolled out a pink carpet to welcome the city’s dinner party set. According to the website of his investment firm, Rapoport Capital, Mr. Rapoport was born in Riga, Latvia, and has lived in the United States, France and Russia. Vladimir Ashurkov, a top aide to Aleksei A. Navalny, a leading Russian opposition leader and critic of the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, described Mr. Rapoport as a successful financier in Moscow and an investor in Soho Rooms, one of the city’s poshest nightclubs. He has also been a supporter of Mr. Navalny since 2010. He recently relocated from Washington to Kiev, Ukraine, where he manages a private equity fund, Mr. Ashurkov said. It was not clear whether Ms. Trump and Mr. Kushner bought the house from the Rapoports or would be renting it from a new owner. But after scouting locations in other exclusive neighborhoods, including nearby Georgetown, the couple settled on a home less than two miles from the White House."
Donald Trump Nominates Wall Street Lawyer to Head S.E.C. - The New York Times,New York Times,Leslie Picker,2017-01-05,"The Wall Street lawyer Walter J. Clayton does not travel in political circles, nor is he well known in corporate America. He is the insider’s insider  —   a deal maker. As such, his nomination to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission is a strong signal that financial regulation in the Trump administration will emphasize helping companies raise capital in the public markets over tightening regulation. In contrast, the agency’s two chairwomen under President Obama had regulatory or enforcement backgrounds. Mr. Clayton, known as Jay, has spent nearly his entire career in corporate boardrooms. His regulatory experience stems from advising banks on dealings with the government and helping several financial institutions with their settlements related to mortgage securities. He had a   seat to the financial crisis, advising Barclays Capital in buying the assets of the bankrupt Lehman Brothers in 2008 and Bear Stearns in its fire sale to JPMorgan Chase in 2007. He has advised on mergers and initial public offerings, including the biggest ever, the $25 billion offering by Alibaba Group of China in 2013. If Mr. Clayton is confirmed, he may have to recuse himself from some matters. A similar scrutiny was applied to Mary Jo White, the agency’s current chairwoman. She had been a litigator at Debevoise  Plimpton, where her clients included JPMorgan Chase, Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation and Kenneth D. Lewis, a former Bank of America chief executive. Still, such recusals are not unusual. Laura S. Unger, a former commissioner and acting chairwoman, said that during her tenure, she had to recuse herself from a number of matters before the commission. She said the process of deciding when to recuse oneself often took place in consultation with the commission’s ethics officer. “An ethics officer at the S. E. C. knows all of your intimate details, and the ethics officer flags for you what may be potential conflicts,” she noted. Yet Mr. Clayton’s nomination will be sure to fuel criticism that Goldman Sachs could wield too much influence in the Trump administration. Sullivan  Cromwell, where Mr. Clayton is a partner, has been Goldman’s   law firm for more than a century. Mr. Clayton advised Goldman Sachs on perhaps its most important deal, the $5 billion investment by Warren E. Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway amid the financial crisis. Mr. Clayton’s wife works as a   adviser at Goldman. The S. E. C. nomination follows the appointment of Goldman’s No. 2 executive, Gary D. Cohn, to be the top economic policy adviser to   Donald J. Trump, and the selection of a hedge fund manager who was a former Goldman trader, Steven T. Mnuchin, to be Treasury secretary. Mr. Trump’s chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, is a former Goldman banker. During the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump had repeatedly criticized Goldman Sachs as an emblem of a financial elite. Mr. Trump, who met with Mr. Clayton on Dec. 22, said in a statement that the lawyer “will ensure our financial institutions can thrive and create jobs while playing by the rules at the same time. ” Mr. Clayton is expected to face scrutiny on his confirmation as a Sullivan  Cromwell colleague, H. Rodgin Cohen, did in 2009. Mr. Cohen, the dean of Wall Street lawyers, withdrew his name from consideration for a senior Treasury role amid an outcry over his deep involvement in nearly all the bank deals struck during the financial crisis. “It’s hard to see how an attorney who spent his career helping Wall Street beat the rap will keep   Trump’s promise to stop big banks and hedge funds from ‘getting away with murder,’” Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, said. “I look forward to hearing how Mr. Clayton will protect retirees and savers from being exploited, demand real accountability from financial institutions the S. E. C. oversees and work to prevent another financial crisis. ” One issue could be Mr. Clayton’s representation of Alibaba. The Chinese   giant is under investigation by the S. E. C. over its accounting practices. Mr. Clayton also represented   Capital Management in its $1. 2 billion initial public offering a decade ago, and subsequent offerings and financing. A unit of the New   hedge fund pleaded guilty for what federal prosecutors said were more than $100 million in bribes paid to officials in African countries. The hedge fund was forced to pay a $400 million settlement. Government authorities said in September that they were still investigating individuals related to case. Another issue could be a 2011 report critical of the government’s enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which argued that “the current   regime” was “causing lasting harm to the competitiveness of U. S. regulated companies and the U. S. capital markets. ” Mr. Clayton was the chairman of the New York City bar association committee that drafted the report. Requests to speak with Mr. Clayton at Sullivan  Cromwell were not answered. A number of fellow deal lawyers said they were glad that the    practitioner could be at the helm of the S. E. C. “He’s a very smart, pragmatic guy who has real deal experience and has seen this stuff firsthand,” said Richard Truesdell, a head of Davis Polk’s global capital markets group, who has worked with Mr. Clayton on several deals. “There’s been a lot of buzz today, and I have yet to talk to anyone who isn’t pleasantly surprised by the choice. ” The role of the Securities and Exchange Commission is to protect investors and enable companies to raise capital through the public markets in a way that fosters economic growth. The latter is a key tenet of Mr. Trump’s economic plan, with the aim that companies can use the excess capital to create jobs. Harvey Pitt, a former chairman of the S. E. C. appointed by President George W. Bush, said Mr. Clayton was a “  appointment. ” “It is especially logical with respect to the agency’s obligation to promote capital formation, a subject with which the incoming administration is appropriately concerned,” said Mr. Pitt in an email. “Mr. Clayton’s background is very impressive  —   both for the depth of his experience, and for the quality of his efforts. ” Mr. Clayton went to the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Cambridge for separate bachelor’s degrees and then obtained his law degree from the University of Pennsylvania Law School. Mr. Clayton donated to Mitt Romney and Mr. Obama in previous presidential elections and to Jeb Bush’s primary campaign in 2015, according to public records. Those who know Mr. Clayton describe him as the     type, a doer who is often in the shadows of the better known Mr. Cohen at Sullivan  Cromwell. “When I think about the position, the guy has a really deep understanding of the capital markets and financial regulatory matters, so he checks those boxes,” said Brad Whitman, vice chairman in mergers and acquisitions at Morgan Stanley, who has worked with Mr. Clayton over many years. “He’s got a great appreciation for what drives business and growth. ”"
"Dylann Roof, Addressing Court, Offers No Apology or Explanation for Massacre - The New York Times",New York Times,Alan Blinder and Kevin Sack,2017-01-06,"CHARLESTON, S. C.  —   Seeming to abdicate one of his last chances to save his own life, the convicted killer Dylann S. Roof stood on Wednesday before the jurors who will decide his fate and offered no apology, no explanation and no remorse for massacring nine black churchgoers during a Bible study session in June 2015. Instead, in a strikingly brief opening statement in the sentencing phase of his federal death penalty trial, Mr. Roof repeatedly assured the jury that he was not mentally ill  —   undercutting one of the few mitigating factors that could work in his favor  —   and left it at that. “Other than the fact that I trust people that I shouldn’t and the fact that I’m probably better at constantly embarrassing myself than anyone who’s ever existed, there’s nothing wrong with me psychologically,” Mr. Roof, who is representing himself, told the jury, which found him guilty last month of the killings at Charleston’s Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church. Three minutes after walking to the lectern, Mr. Roof returned to the defense table, exhaling deeply. Any prospects for mercy by the jury had perhaps already been drained by the prosecution’s disclosure, in its opening statement, of a white supremacist manifesto written by Mr. Roof in the Charleston County jail sometime in the six weeks after his arrest. “I would like to make it crystal clear I do not regret what I did,” he wrote in his distinctive scrawl. “I am not sorry. I have not shed a tear for the innocent people I killed. ” Mr. Roof, who was then 21, continued: “I do feel sorry for the innocent white children forced to live in this sick country and I do feel sorry for the innocent white people that are killed daily at the hands of the lower race. I have shed a tear of   for myself. I feel pity that I had to do what I did in the first place. I feel pity that I had to give up my life because of a situation that should never have existed. ” As the government laid out its case for a death sentence, the prosecutor who read from the journal, Nathan S. Williams, an assistant United States attorney, told the jury of 10 women and two men that Mr. Roof’s deadly rampage was a premeditated act that had devastated the families of his victims. “The defendant didn’t stop after shooting one person or two or four or five he killed nine people,” Mr. Williams said, a few moments before he declared, “The death penalty is justified. ” Later, aided by a slide show, he described each of the victims and their lives, setting the stage for several days of   testimony by family members and friends of the victims. Mr. Williams emphasized that Mr. Roof was capable of remorse and regret, reminding jurors that he had left his mother a note of apology, but only for the pain he knew his actions would cause his own family. The presentations were a startling beginning to the trial’s sentencing phase, which is expected to run into next week in Federal District Court. On Dec. 15, after six days of testimony in which defense lawyers did not contest his guilt, the jury found Mr. Roof guilty of 33 counts, including hate crimes, obstruction of religion resulting in death, and firearms charges. Eighteen of those counts require the jury to decide whether to sentence Mr. Roof, now 22, to death or life in prison without the possibility of parole. To impose a death sentence, jurors must unanimously find that aggravating factors like premeditation and the number and vulnerability of the victims outweigh any mitigating factors, like the absence of prior violent behavior and demonstrations of redemption and remorse. Mr. Roof is also facing a death penalty trial in state court. Although many people in the courtroom had already heard Mr. Roof’s flat,   monotone during the guilt phase, when prosecutors played a video recording of his   confession to F. B. I. agents, his statement on Wednesday was his first to the jury. Mr. Roof chose to allow his   legal team to represent him during the guilt phase, but sidelined them during the penalty proceedings to prevent them from introducing any evidence regarding his family background or mental capacity. “The point is that I’m not going to lie to you, not by myself or through somebody else,” Mr. Roof told the jury. As his paternal grandparents watched from the second row on the left side of the courtroom, several women on the right side, which is reserved for victims’ family members, left their seats, one of them muttering curses. Mr. Roof has said he does not plan to call witnesses or present evidence on his behalf, and he did not   any of the prosecution’s witnesses on Wednesday. His approach stands in sharp contrast to the strategy of Justice Department lawyers, who have said they may call more than 30 witnesses, including at least one survivor of the attack, family members of the victims and federal law enforcement officials. Prosecutors began Wednesday with the widow of the Rev. Clementa C. Pinckney, the church’s slain pastor, and his two best friends. Jennifer Benjamin Pinckney, who was married to Mr. Pinckney for 15 years, narrated an affectionate and often lighthearted telling of their life together, illustrated by dozens of photographs of her husband  —   as a young saxophone player in a school band, attending the births of their two daughters, vacationing on Caribbean cruises and on a trip to Seattle. She described him as a   preacher who extended his ministry as “a voice for the voiceless” to his work in the South Carolina Legislature, where he served first in the House and then the Senate. Often exhausted by his dual roles, he was depicted in several pictures as having fallen asleep in the back seat of the family car and on a couch while reading to his daughters. “He was the person that I think every mom would be happy that her daughter would marry,” Ms. Pinckney, a school librarian, said. “He was that great catch. ” Ms. Pinckney also described her terror on the night of June 17, 2015, as she and the couple’s younger daughter, Malana, then 6, listened to the gunfire from their hiding place beneath a desk in her husband’s study. As her husband and the others were gunned down in the adjacent church fellowship hall, Ms. Pinckney struggled to keep her daughter quiet and still. “I was just like, ‘Shh, shh, shh,’ ” Ms. Pinckney said, “and I put my hand over her mouth, and she was holding on to me, and she put her hand on my mouth. ” “Mama, is Daddy going to die?” her daughter asked, Ms. Pinckney said. She said the hardest thing she had ever done was telling her two daughters early the next morning that their father had been killed. Ms. Pinckney said she had heard Mr. Roof try to open the door to the study, which she had locked when the shooting began. Another assistant United States attorney, Julius N. Richardson, asked why she thought she had been spared. “It wasn’t my time,” Ms. Pinckney answered. “I couldn’t see God taking both parents away from two small kids. ” The Rev. Kylon Middleton, an A. M. E. minister who had known Mr. Pinckney from childhood, described his lifelong friend as immensely precocious (he began preaching at 13) and strategically ambitious (he aspired to be both a bishop and, perhaps, the state’s first   governor). In addition to Mr. Pinckney, the victims were the Rev. DePayne Middleton Doctor, 49 Cynthia Hurd, 54 Susie Jackson, 87 Ethel Lee Lance, 70 Tywanza Sanders, 26 the Rev. Daniel Lee Simmons Sr. 74 the Rev. Sharonda   45 and Myra Thompson, 59. Near the end of the day, Ms. Thompson’s widower, the Rev. Anthony B. Thompson, the vicar of a Reformed Episcopal Church here, told jurors about their   marriage, their anniversary date to a beach, his wife’s determined demeanor and her commitment to the historic congregation. In testimony that was mixed with laughter and tears, Mr. Thompson recounted their final day together as she prepared for the evening study of the Gospel of Mark. “She had her glow,” he said. “I mean, this smile on her face. She was radiant. I just kept looking at her. ” Word of a shooting came hours later, and Mr. Thompson rushed to the church. He demanded to know whether she had been injured or killed. He eventually found out. “My whole world was gone,” he said. “I literally did not know what to do. Everything I did was for her, and she was gone. What am I here for? If she’s gone, what am I here for?”"
"In Turkey, U.S. Hand Is Seen in Nearly Every Crisis - The New York Times",New York Times,Tim Arango,2017-01-05,"ISTANBUL  —   Turkish officials accused the United States of abetting a failed coup last summer. When the Russian ambassador to Turkey was assassinated last month, the Turkish press said the United States was behind the attack. And once again, after a gunman walked into an Istanbul nightclub early on New Year’s Day and killed dozens, the   news media pointed a finger at the United States. “America Chief Suspect,” one headline blared after the attack. On Twitter, a Turkish lawmaker, referring to the name of the nightclub, wrote: “Whoever the triggerman is, Reina attack is an act of CIA. Period. ” Turkey has been confronted with a cascade of crises that seem to have only accelerated as the Syrian civil war has spilled across the border. But the events have not pushed Turkey closer to its NATO allies. Conversely, they have drifted further apart as the nation lashes out at Washington and moves closer to Moscow, working with the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, to secure a   in Syria. One story in the Turkish press, based on a routine travel warning issued by the American Embassy in Turkey, was that the United States had advance knowledge of the nightclub attack, which the Islamic State later claimed responsibility for. Another suggested that stun grenades used by the gunman had come from stocks held by the American military. Still another claimed the assault was a plot by the United States to sow divisions in Turkey between the secular and the religious. Rather than bringing the United States and Turkey together in the common fight against terrorism, the nightclub attack, even with the gunman still on the run, appears to have only accelerated Turkey’s shift away from the West, at a time when its democracy is eroding amid a growing crackdown on civil society. All of this is a reflection, many critics say, of what they call the paranoia and authoritarianism of Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whose leadership has so deeply divided the country that, instead of unifying to confront terrorism, Turkish society is fracturing further with each attack. The West, symbolized by the United States, is the perennial bogeyman. While seeming to pile on the Obama administration in its waning days  —   by accusing it of supporting Turkey’s enemies, including the Islamic State Kurdish militants and supporters of an exiled Muslim cleric, Fethullah Gulen, whom Mr. Erdogan blamed for directing the coup  —   Turkish officials are also telegraphing something else: that they are willing to open the door and improve relations with the United States once   Donald J. Trump takes office. “Our expectation from the new administration is to end this shame,” Turkey’s prime minister, Binali Yildirim, said this week while accusing the United States of providing weapons to Kurdish militants in Syria who are fighting the Islamic State, but are also an enemy of Turkey. “We are not holding the new administration responsible for this,” Mr. Yildirim said. “Because this is the work of the Obama administration. ” Meanwhile, the nightclub assailant is on the loose. The Turkish authorities said on Wednesday that they had identified the killer, but refused to release any other details, although photographs of the man, from surveillance cameras, have been released. Also, a video surfaced that appeared to show the assailant recording himself in Istanbul’s Taksim Square. A senior United States official, who has been briefed on the investigation and spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential details, said the Turks had recovered the video from a raid on a house in Istanbul. The official said the Turks now believed the killer was from Uzbekistan, not Kyrgyzstan, as many reports this week had first suggested. The official expressed alarm at the growing   in Turkey, which seems to accumulate after each crisis here, and said it put the lives of Americans in the country in jeopardy. The chaotic investigation has added to the anxiety on Istanbul’s streets, with vehicle checkpoints, night raids on houses and   helicopters. “There is significant fear in ordinary people,” said Aydin Engin, a columnist at the daily newspaper Cumhuriyet, who was detained last year as part of the government’s crackdown on the news media. “Fear prevails when it comes to going to an entertainment place, being in a crowd, going to a shopping mall, getting on the metro. ” With each passing day, public life descends deeper into what many Turks concede is a mix of darkness and seeming absurdity, with growing fears of violence and expressions of xenophobia set next to repressions on civic life. In the days before and after the nightclub massacre on the shores of the Bosporus, nationalists staged a mock execution of Santa Claus in the name of defending Islam a reporter for The Wall Street Journal was detained,   and placed in solitary confinement  —   for, according to the newspaper’s account, “violating a government ban on publication of images from an Islamic State video” and a   fashion designer was beaten up at the Istanbul airport and arrested for his social media posts. “In a way, it’s basically a breakdown of order,” said Soli Ozel, a Turkish columnist and academic, seeking to explain the tumult in society. “Everyone feels entitled to do whatever they want to do and how they want to do it. ” Tugrul Eryilmaz, another longtime Turkish journalist, recalled the country’s military coup in 1980 and the crackdown on civil society that followed, and said, “I have never been in such a situation like today. ” He brought up the Spanish filmmaker Luis Buñuel, who was known for surreal and absurd themes. “I feel like I am in his movies,” he said. While Turkey faces a growing terrorism threat, the country is also largely at war with itself, with deep divisions along many lines  —   religion, class, ethnicity  —   that make unity difficult even in a time of crisis. Perhaps the greatest source of division is between supporters of Mr. Erdogan, about half the country, and opponents who assert that he has become too powerful. “Turkey is so deeply polarized around the powerful persona of Erdogan that, instead of asking why terror attacks are happening and how they can be stopped, the   and   blocks in the country are blaming each other,” said Soner Cagaptay, a specialist on Turkey at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. “This is why I am deeply worried about Turkey and the country’s ability to stymie further terror attacks. ” Parliament voted overnight to extend by three months the state of emergency that went into effect last summer after the failed coup. The emergency grants Mr. Erdogan’s government extraordinary powers to detain perceived opponents and hold them in pretrial detention. Tens of thousands of people have either been arrested or been purged from their jobs, on suspicion of having links to Mr. Gulen, who now lives in Pennsylvania. Mr. Erdogan on Wednesday made his first public remarks since the attack on Sunday morning, a striking period of silence for a man who is normally ubiquitous in the public sphere, often giving speeches daily. Mr. Erdogan, an Islamist, rejected criticism that his government, in pushing an Islamist agenda, had deepened divisions between the secular and the pious. Many on social media, in the aftermath of the nightclub attack, noted that the Turkish government’s religious authorities had denounced New Year’s celebrations as  . “As the president of all 79 million citizens,” Mr. Erdogan said, “it is my duty to protect everyone’s rights, law and spaces of freedom. ” Mr. Erdogan, who spoke this week with President Obama in a condolence call, also told his audience what he believed Turkey, in facing so many terrorist attacks, was really up against: a plot by the West. Invoking the collapse of the Ottoman Empire after World War I and the subsequent Turkish war against Western armies and their proxies, he said, “Today Turkey is in a new struggle for independence. ”"
A New Casualty of Syria’s War: Drinking Water in Damascus - The New York Times,New York Times,Ben Hubbard,2017-01-05,"BEIRUT, Lebanon  —   For millions of Damascus residents,   concerns about the direction of the war in Syria have been replaced by worries about where to get enough water to do the dishes, wash clothes or take a shower. For nearly two weeks, the Syrian capital and its vicinity have been afflicted by a water crisis that has left taps dry, caused long lines at wells and forced people to stretch whatever thin resources they can find. “When the world gets hard for us, we work something out,” said a woman in a video posted on Facebook showing how she used a   cola bottle to wash teacups. “When you cut off the water, we dig for water. When you cut off the tap, we make a tap. ” Like most of Syria’s problems, the Damascus water crisis is a symptom of the war, which has killed hundreds of thousands of people, displaced about half the country’s prewar population of 22 million and left its territory divided into zones controlled by the government, armed rebels and jihadist groups. While a   brokered by Russia and Turkey and announced last week has reduced overall violence across the country, it has not stopped the fighting everywhere, nor has it resolved what happens when resources needed by one side are controlled by its enemies, as appears to be the case with Damascus’s water. Historically, most of the water for the capital, which is controlled by the government of President Bashar   has come from the Barada Valley north of the city, which is controlled by rebels who want to oust Mr. Assad. The crisis began on Dec. 22, when the water stopped flowing. Each side has accused the other of damaging infrastructure near the spring, halting the flow. Antigovernment activists have posted photos online, purporting to show structures around the spring that they say were damaged by exploding barrels dropped from government helicopters. The government first accused the rebels of polluting the water, then of damaging the infrastructure. Jens Laerke, a spokesman for the United Nations humanitarian office in Geneva, said by email Tuesday that the “deliberate targeting of the water infrastructure” had caused the  . “But we are not in a position to say by whom,” he said. “The area has been the scene of much fighting, so we have not been able to access it. ” Now, 5. 5 million people in Damascus and the vicinity lack water, which has raised the risk of waterborne disease, especially among children, he said. Fighting near the Barada Valley has continued despite the  . Antigovernment activists say that government forces, and fighters from Lebanon’s Hezbollah organization, have continued to attack the area in an apparent attempt to take it over. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which tracks the conflict from Britain through a network of contacts in Syria, said the government launched 15 airstrikes on the area Monday amid clashes between rebels and   forces. Turkey’s foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, accused the Syrian government and its allies on Wednesday of violating the   saying that the new violence could derail peace talks meant to be held in Astana, the capital of Kazakhstan, on Jan. 23. Rebel groups have threatened to boycott the talks if government attacks do not stop. Few Damascus residents expect much from the talks or have time to think about them. While generally safe from the violence that had reduced other parts of the country to rubble, they were struggling through a cold winter of high prices and scarce commodities before the water crisis, making things worse. The Syrian government has sought to ease the crisis by trucking water from wells around the city, and the United Nations has rehabilitated 120 wells to cover about   of the city’s daily needs, Mr. Laerke, the spokesman, said. But many residents said they had received nothing. Some were buying water from men with private tankers, while others took advantage of whatever they could get. A    shopkeeper said he had not had a shower in 10 days but that he and his sons went to the mosque every day to wash their hands, feet and faces, an option not available to the women of the house. At home, he said, they used plastic utensils because they could not wash dishes. One    woman said she had not had running water in her home for 10 days. Her two sons have spent hours each day lining up to fill jugs from the well at their mosque. They use that to drink and to wash dishes, collecting the runoff to flush the toilet. “My family’s dream is to get a warm shower,” she said, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of repercussions for communicating with a foreign news outlet without government permission. “It has become our ultimate hope in Damascus to have enough water to take showers and wash clothes in the automatic washing machine. ” She expressed anger that Syria’s   news media had said little about the water crisis, instead focusing on the military’s battles with rebels. “We are fed up with the news of military operations,” she said. “We want news about water and water supply schedules. ” Despite the water crisis, conditions in Damascus are far better than those in Aleppo, the northern city and former commercial epicenter of the country, where Syrian and Russian forces prevailed last month after prolonged bombardments of its eastern side. While the   appears to be holding there, the formerly   eastern quarters are abandoned wastelands, United Nations relief officials said. “Nothing prepared us for what we saw,” Sajjad Malik, the United Nations acting humanitarian coordinator for Syria, told reporters Wednesday in a telephone briefing from Aleppo. “The infrastructure was destroyed in almost every neighborhood. ” Mr. Malik said more than 100 United Nations relief workers from several agencies were helping civil defense teams remove debris and provide emergency food, water, shelter and medical care in the city, where four million people once lived. He estimated that 1. 5 million people remain in Aleppo, mostly on the western side, including roughly 400, 000 Syrians displaced from other areas. He also said thousands of displaced residents from the eastern side were starting to return, even if their homes and businesses were badly damaged or destroyed. “They’re beginning to talk about rebuilding their lives and livelihoods,” Mr. Malik said. But he cautioned that “Aleppo’s reconstruction is going to take a much longer time and way more resources than we have right now. ”"
My Canada - The New York Times,New York Times,,2017-01-11,"Canada, our No. 1 pick for this year’s 52 Places to Go list, spans millions of square miles. It also contains multitudes, not just of people and locations, but of memories. We asked five Canadian authors to reflect on places that have lodged in their psyches. My mother always kept a bright yellow hard hat in her car, an unexpected accessory for a petite Hong Kong immigrant in her  . She was the senior purchaser for a British Columbia forestry company that, in lean years, laid off everyone in her department except her. (More’s the pity she dreamed of early retirement.) In the meantime, she shuttled between the province’s pulp and paper mills, doing the job of six people, negotiating contracts for hotels, log loaders, harvesters and more. One year, when I was 25, I finally said yes to her persistent invitations to tag along. She wanted me to meet the men and women who earned their living in the mill towns, and who called her by her English name, Matilda. We set out in her car, exploring the    of Vancouver Island, heading for the northern tip, Port Hardy. This would turn out to be the last trip we took together. I remember the wet October chill eagles descending over corridors of evergreens a seemingly endless highway. At twilight, the world took on the shifting depths of an Emily Carr painting. I had to put up with my mother’s terrible driving, and her devotion to Celine Dion. She had to put up with my moods. I was going through a breakup and had decided that, in order to strengthen my moral fiber, I should camp, alone, for three days in the woods. I instructed my mother to drop me off at my campsite, work for a few days in Port Hardy, and then pick me up again. Port Hardy is a microcosm of Canada: a   town with a complex human and environmental history. The archaeological site of the island’s oldest known human habitation (circa 5850 B. C.) the area is the place of origin for the Kwakiutl peoples. The land of the Kwakiutl, whose name translates to “smoke of the world,” was taken into ownership  —   both private and national  —   by gunpoint, dishonored treaties and restrictive and discriminatory laws. The scramble for artifacts and the theft of Kwakiutl art  —   work that was celebrated by Claude   as among the most sophisticated in the world  —   has meant that much of the community’s historical work is housed in museums elsewhere. After 1849, the Kwakiutl population was decimated, but it survives. In 2013, British Columbia was found to have once again breached the Kwakiutl’s 1851 Treaty rights. This is not a history I learned in school. Alone in the woods, I pitched my tent. The dark fell suddenly. I made it five hours before calling my mom, telling her I was afraid, and asking her to come get me. That night, we shared a bed in a small lodging provided by her company. I smelled of the fire I had briefly managed to start. It felt good to lie beside my mother in a place that was complex and old. A little over a year later, my mother died suddenly in a town where she was working, much like this one, on a November night when her heart gave out. It was her   two kind forestry men who, worried about my mother, entered her hotel room in the morning, to find her gone. So peaceful, they told us, as if she were only sleeping. Fourteen years later, I understand better how the smoke of the world is never still. Many of the mills my mother visited have closed, jobs have been lost, and, as of a decade ago, a staggering 75 percent of Vancouver Island’s productive   forest has been logged. It is a place that will tell us much about the balance between jobs and environmental stewardship, about our respect for First Nations treaty rights and our obligations to the land. This is the Canada still to come. Madeleine Thien is the author of “Do Not Say We Have Nothing. ” Grindstone Island is a   dot of green leaves and Victorian gingerbread structures in the middle of Big Rideau Lake, halfway between Kingston and Ottawa.   in the 19th century to make way for its eponymous grindstone quarry, the island later became the summer home of Charles Kingsmill, the first admiral of the Royal Canadian Navy, and served as a genteel hub for Ottawa society life. Kingsmill’s daughter, Diana, who had a lifelong association with pacifist Quakers, took over Grindstone and turned it into a nonviolent resistance education center, staging legendary   games that recreated the infamous Stanford Prison Experiment as a way to train the “prisoners” to fight oppression with noncooperation  —   a practice that ended after a disastrous fake “invasion” by a local biker gang retained for the purpose. I came to Grindstone as a young teenager in the   attending the annual summer camps run by the nonprofit cooperative the Quakers put together to manage the island. The camps’ explicit mission was to train a new generation of activists, another step on the ladder that they had climbed, through trade unionism, farmers’ unions, suffragism and feminism, to antiwar activism. Grindstone was full of kids like me:   babies who attended alternative public schools in Toronto, Kingston and Ottawa, who could rhyme the classic protest chant “   ” with the facility of lifelong practice. Today it sounds hopelessly idealistic. But in the ’80s, Grindstone was a perfect incubator for young activists. With its quiet paths, crisp lake swimming and isolated spots with names like Moonwatcher’s Point, the Grindstone experience was one part lazing around and chatting, one part intense, practical instruction. The Victorian cottages we slept in had once housed the political elites of Ottawa society and their celebrity friends. Now they were ours. I’ve always been an early riser, and it was on Grindstone that I became addicted to sunrises, swimming around the island to catch them on the still lake amid the loon calls, then rushing in a shiver back to my cabin to change for breakfast and morning meeting on the broad, shaded porch of the main lodge. As I graduated out of the summer camps, I became active in the maintenance and management of the island, volunteering in the kitchens and serving on the  ’s board. When the  ’s finances crashed with the   recession, we sold the island to a dentist from Kingston who planned to commute by small pontoon plane. I was devastated. Today, Grindstone is the private home of David Bearman and Jennifer Trant  —   museum technology pioneers who fell in love with the island the first time they saw it, immediately dissolved their successful consultancy and took up residence there, running small conferences for people interested in museums and the web. Five years ago my family and I were their guests. The island felt haunted by the ghosts of the friends I’d made there and the dreams we’d shared. It has been 25 years since I left Grindstone on its final weekend as a social justice education center, and not a week goes by without my yearning for it with a kind of joy and sorrow that is sunk very deep in my heart. I visit it in my dreams, and in the photo feeds from its current owners when I see them at museum conferences, I demand to know all the minutiae of the island’s upkeep, which trees survived the winter storms and what color they’re painting the porch this year. I live in Burbank, Calif. now, and I take my    daughter on hikes in the nearby mountains. Sometimes, when we sit on a trailside boulder and listen to the winds soughing in the trees, I can almost pretend that I’ve brought her back to Grindstone, the place I had always assumed I would raise my own family. Cory Doctorow is the author of the forthcoming novel “Walkaway” and a special adviser to the Electronic Frontier Foundation. The Hawker Siddeley HS 748 is a delightful,   turboprop relic of an airplane, with metal everywhere you expect plastic, made to land on gravel or ice. Nestled in a Hawker, I flew north from Whitehorse, Yukon’s capital city, past 300 miles of moonscape  —   gray craters scarred by the white lines of mining roads that seemed to loop and go nowhere  —   before Dawson City appeared through a hole in the cloud cover. The subarctic town, nicknamed “Paris of the North” during the late   Gold Rush, looked like a strange, solitary incursion on the land. I was there to spend three months living in the childhood home of the Canadian writer Pierre Berton, who had donated the house for this purpose. A volunteer picked me up at the   airport. On the drive through town, we passed a truck with an animal carcass in the bed, antlers poking out past a tarp.   black birds pecked at the exposed edges. “If you leave your moose out, the ravens will get at it,” the volunteer said. The Yukon River divided the town into Dawson proper and West Dawson, a scattered community of   cabins whose inhabitants hauled their own wood, water and propane. I walked down to the river almost every day. It was October, and the black, bottomless water flowed fast toward Alaska. Over the next few weeks, the river changed. First the water took on the faint sheen of an oil slick. Then slivers of ice began to race along the current, catching the light like the heads and bellies of surfacing seals. Then bigger,   chunks of ice formed, audibly colliding and jostling for space until they clustered and   at a bottleneck bend. Finally, one morning in November, I woke to an eerie, noticeable silence. I went down to the river’s beach sheets of ice overlapped where they’d heaved onto the shore, their exposed   resembling massive blocks of turquoise glass. A government employee had drilled into the ice and laid out orange flags indicating where the ice was thick enough to walk safely. I watched a dogsled cross. Because of the snow cover, it wasn’t immediately clear where the ground ended and the river began. As I stepped out, I could hear ice continuing to crack, the sound of trickling water running in open rivulets. Under my feet, I’d been told, ran water deep enough to swallow a truck. This would be a stupid way to die, I thought. Halfway across, I stopped and looked south, toward where the Yukon River met the Klondike River. At this time of year, the sun rose so late and set so early that it circled the horizon in a continuous blaze of orange. Part of the Canadian identity is that we’re a hardy people, thriving in the inhospitable north. It’s one of those myths so ingrained and pervasive that you believe it even if, like me  —   like most  —   you have lived your whole life in cities less than 60 miles north of the American border. For just a moment, my breath clouding around me, icicles forming on my chin, I stood in that mythical Canada. I crossed and hiked triumphantly around West Dawson, which had been inaccessible except by helicopter during the  . The temperature dropped below   degrees Celsius. When I returned to the house, hours later, I peeled off my jeans and saw that my thighs, like my cheeks and nose, were a raw, violent red. Out on the river, I had seen two other people crossing. The first glided past on   skis with a baby strapped to his chest. The second was an acquaintance pulling a sled. “Just picking up my mail!” he called. Kim Fu is the author of the novel “For Today I Am a Boy” and the poetry collection “How Festive the Ambulance. ”  Hans Johann was a capitalist pig farmer, a man who owned the pigs and the farm. His wife was Barbara. They were both German Mennonites. After World War II, both had fled with their families from what was once Prussia to Niagara, which is where, on some acres between the lake and the waterfalls, they stayed and became Mama and Papa, then Oma and Opa. My mother, Linda, was the fourth of Oma and Opa’s seven children, born and christened at such a rate that the family could not afford middle names. Mama made up for this by calling me “Sarah Nicole,” while my father, one of four from the suburbs, has never said anything but “Sarah. ” At home in London, Ontario, I sided with my dad, thinking two names were less smart than one but when we went to the pig farm, my name was turned by thick German tongues into “   . ” This older, extrinsic version of me was the one I liked best. Summers belonged to Niagara. Driving to the farm in a station wagon with no empty seats, we knew we were close when the asphalt turned to dirt and had arrived when the dirt turned to gravel. A long lane,   in birches, led to an ancient Mercedes or two and a big John Deere tractor, a nameless cat curled under the exhaust pipe. In the kitchen, we ate Oma’s bread with havarti cheese and   summer grapes, on which a skim of dust belied a   of gold. What did we need money for? Nothing. Ice cream, maybe, if we wanted it in a cone from Avondale Dairy. Turtles swam with us in the pool, the water cold and unchlorinated under scum, colored the dim vegetative green of fairy tales before they’re Americanized. Oma said her ferns would grow better if we urinated in the soil, and we rolled our eyes but did it, one at a time. I sneaked away to the gully, read my aunt’s ahistorical romance novels. My brother shot a dove with a BB gun. Pigs screamed in the barn. It seemed in those summers impossible that the sun could either burn me or fail to wake me up, that I could ever be sick for more than three days or have an allergy. I was no more friends with nature than I was friends with my kin, yet it seemed that nature and I felt the same way: indifferent to the rules, remote no matter how we were tamed. My grandfather is alive, freshly widowed. Though he no longer capitalizes on much or practices animal husbandry, he lives in the bungalow on the farm and makes and sells peach and grape jam. Everyone thinks they know what peach and grape jam taste like, but I maintain that Opa’s jam can make you forget what a fruit is. Sarah Nicole Prickett is a writer in New York and the founder of Adult Magazine.  A few years ago, I got to pick a small village to stay in for a while and write poetry. I chose the Missisquoi Valley, in the Eastern Townships of Quebec, because I liked what the bay’s First Nations name meant: many aquatic birds. Indeed, I saw birds everywhere: in my dreams, above my head, through the windows. I saw the wind, too, moving across the cornfields. The region also brought me back to my love of New England. When choosing the town I was to stay in, I’d randomly pointed at a little village called Mystic. It was an enticing name. I’d also found a sister city in the United States with the same name, which had a museum with a room dedicated to Herman Melville. When I write, I always let myself be led by coincidence. I quickly started inventing connections between Melville and the Québécois Mystic between me scribbling notes in a rented Cavalier and the trailblazers of real and fictional territory that were the great American writers of the 19th century. I also imagined stories of the devil whirling around in the town’s   barn, and created my own private numerology. I would look for covered bridges on the road, round barns built by utopian Quakers and Victorian houses. I thought about loyalists fleeing north after the Revolutionary War, about Irish Catholics fleeing famine, about all the immigrants who left their mark along the path. I knew that by venturing further, to the shores of the great Lake Memphremagog, I would also think about the Vietnam War deserters who’d found refuge there. I thought about the First Nation Abenakis, how they named the lakes and rivers, and about our ignorance. I began my stay at Pike River, but I understood that this road was one where each stop would lead to another. I walked into the office of tourism in Stanbridge Station, my next stop, and asked a petite historian a thousand questions. She showed me Chemin St.  on the map, which she called the second prettiest road in Quebec. (I never learned where the first was.) I didn’t stay in Mystic. As soon as I caught sight of the old cemetery in Hunter Mills, I became fascinated by the border zone between Quebec and the United States. It represented the state I was in myself: a wandering state of mind, looking for ghosts, mine and others’ looking for my words, my promised land, my house built stone by stone throughout my life. And that is how, having been asked to stay in a small village, I found myself gathering the rosary beads of hamlets strung along the border area. I’m still enamored with the scenery I found there: isolated villages in the shadow of the mountains, whose grandeur lorded over long lakes and rivers farms and cornfields a Mercedes up on four blocks amid the junk strewn in front of an abandoned house old   cemeteries that pop up at every turn leafy trees of maple, walnut, beech, oak, birch a few wayside crosses old churches and train stations and checkpoints and in the morning, at the inn by the river, a little black cat sitting on a tree branch listening to the sound of the falls and the purring coffeepot. Élise Turcotte, a poet and novelist, is the author of “The Sound of Living Things” and “Guyana. ” Translated by Allison M. Charette. En français: Il y a quelques années, on m’a demandé de séjourner dans un petit village de mon choix afin d’y écrire des poèmes. J’ai choisi la vallée de la Missisquoi dans les cantons de l’est en Québec, parce que j’aimais la signification du nom donné par les Premières Nations à la baie: beaucoup d’oiseaux aquatiques. Déjà, je voyais des oiseaux partout, dans mes rêves, autour de ma tête, derrière les fenêtres. Je voyais aussi le vent bouger à travers les champs de maïs. Cette région me ramenait aussi à mon amour de la  . Afin de choisir le village de mon séjour, j’avais pointé mon doigt sur un petit village appelé Mystic. Ce nom m’attirait. J’avais aussi découvert une ville homonyme aux   où il y avait, dans un musée, une salle dédiée à Melville. Je me laisse toujours guider par les coïncidences pour écrire. J’inventais d’ores et déjà des liens entre Melville et le Mystic québécois entre moi prenant des notes dans une Cavalier louée, et ces défricheurs de territoires réels et fictifs que sont les grands écrivains américains du 19e siècle. J’imaginais aussi des histoires de diable tournant en rond dans la Grange à douze côtés, et créais une numérologie intime à moi. Je chercherais les ponts couverts sur la route, les granges rondes construites par des quakers utopiques, les maisons à façade victorienne je pensais à la fuite des loyalistes vers le nord, aux Irlandais catholiques fuyant la famine, à tous ces immigrants ayant laissé leurs traces sur le chemin. Je savais qu’en m’aventurant plus loin, aux abords du grand lac Memphrémagog, je penserais aussi aux déserteurs de la guerre du Vietnam. Je pensais aux Abénaquis des Premières Nations, qui ont donné les noms aux lacs et aux rivières, à notre ignorance. À   là où mon séjour commençait, j’ai compris cependant que j’étais sur une route où chaque arrêt menait à un autre. Je suis entrée dans le bureau du tourisme, j’ai posé mille questions à une petite historienne de Stanbridge Station. Elle m’a indiqué sur la carte où se trouve Chemin   la deuxième plus belle route du Québec. (Je n’ai pas jamais appris où se situe la première). Et je ne suis pas restée à Mystic: dès que j’ai aperçu le vieux cimetière de Hunter Mills, c’est la zone frontalière entre le Québec et les   qui m’a fascinée. Elle était l’illustration de l’état dans lequel je me trouvais, dans l’esprit de l’errance, à la recherche de fantômes, les miens, ceux des autres à la recherche de mes mots, ma terre promise, ma maison construite pierre après pierre tout au long de ma vie. Et c’est ainsi qu’appelée à séjourner dans un petit village, je me suis retrouvée à ramasser les grains d’un chapelet de hameaux dispersés sur le chemin de la frontière. Le décor que j’y ai trouvé m’enchante toujours: villages enclavés dans l’ombre des montagnes, dont le grandeur veillaient sur les lacs longs et les rivières fermes et champs de maïs une Mercedes sur quatre blocs à travers le débarras devant une maison à l’abandon de vieux cimetières   qui surprennent à chaque détour des arbres feuillus, érables, noyers, êtres, chênes, bouleaux quelques croix de chemin d’anciennes gares et églises, de vieux postes de frontière et le matin, à l’auberge, un petit chat noir perché sur une branche d’arbre écoutant le bruit des chutes et de la cafetière qui ronronne."
How We Put Together Our 52 Places to Go List - The New York Times,New York Times,,2017-01-15,"For the 12th straight year, the Travel section presents its annual Places to Go issue. You will likely have some questions: How did the No. 1 spot get there? Why is my favorite spot not on the list? What’s the deal with those 360 videos online at nytimes. ? Here are some frequently asked questions about how we chose our 52 Places to Go in 2017.  What made Canada the top choice? And why would you choose a country?  Canada has it all (O. K. maybe not tropical beaches). It’s a world unto itself, with Vancouver Island surf breaks, culinary delights in Toronto and Montreal, and natural glories of parks like Banff in Alberta. And, let’s face it, clichés of Mounties and hockey aside, Canada remains a terra incognita for Americans and much of the world. It’s a great time to correct that, as the country celebrates its 150th anniversary this year (which means free admission all year to those national parks) and currently offers a generous exchange rate with the United States dollar. What is special about the list online? And in print? Look at the interactive version of the list on a computer or mobile device and you’ll notice a bunch of 360 videos that allow you to explore some of these places in a newly immersive way. “Travel is a great match for 360 videos because the medium provides a vivid sense of place,” said Maureen Towey, the senior producer for 360 News at The New York Times. “We ask our shooters to be adventurous in their camera placement. When they ask if they can rig the camera to a motorcycle, a   balloon or a ski lift, we say yes every time. ” On a computer, you’ll also notice a stunning drone video, shot in Tofino, on the western coast of Vancouver Island. “After many wet days, there was one morning the clouds broke and the waves were a bit better,” said Josh Haner, a staff photographer who shot the footage. “As my drone’s batteries were running out, I looked to the right and a beautiful rainbow filled the beach. It was a spectacular 45 minutes. ” And print readers will notice something new as well: a special   presentation of the list that can be removed from the section and pored over (or hung on the wall). How do you start the process? We ask our regular contributors, many of whom live overseas or roam the globe, for ideas. We get hundreds of them. What are you looking for in those ideas? First, why now? That is, why is this the year to go to a particular place? We also aim for a geographic and thematic diversity. And we look for a mix of destinations both   and off the beaten path. (That means we often exclude the very obvious spots even though cities like London, Berlin and Tokyo are always exciting, they didn’t make this year’s list.) How do you narrow it down to the final list? A   meeting, in which we discuss each idea. We get pretty punchy toward the end but are always happy with the final list. My favorite destination didn’t make the list. Why not? The 52 places we select are, of course, just the start. There are thousands of wonderful destinations to consider. We’d love to hear your suggestions  —   use the #52Places2017 hashtag on Instagram to suggest yours."
Places to Put Your Hands Together - The New York Times,New York Times,Shivani Vora,2017-01-07,"Whether the music to your ears is pop, classical, jazz, country or another type of tune altogether, the rhythms of 2017 have you covered. Dance the days and nights away at Summerfest, June 28 to July 9 in Milwaukee, an   bonanza that includes 800 acts spread out across 11 stages at Henry Maier Festival Park on Lake Michigan. The Red Hot Chili Peppers and Pink are among the headline performers this year, the festival’s 50th, but other genres such as   classic rock, Latin and reggae are also represented. The Monterey International Pop Festival, June 16 to 18 in Monterey, Calif. is also turning 50 this year, and celebrating in style, on the same weekend and at the same location  —   the Monterey County Fair and Events Center  —   where the original festival was held in 1967. That event helped establish the careers of many legendary musicians, including Jimi Hendrix, the Who and the Grateful Dead, and this year, over the course of three days, nine bands will take the stage to pay tribute to them. In Monte Carlo, it’s all jazz all the time at the 12th annual   Jazz Festival (November and December, exact dates to be determined) featuring performances by the world’s top jazz players such as Manu Katché, the drummer and singer, the bassist Richard Bona, and Ibrahim Maalouf, the trumpet player, all of whom were guests in 2016. The heart of the action takes place at the Opéra Garnier   an ornate   building, but the shows spill over into the Casino de   and glitzy oceanfront bars. Mellower sounds are in store on the Caribbean island of Mustique from Jan. 18 to Feb. 1, at the Mustique Blues Festival, a   secret among discerning fans. The event unfolds over nearly two weeks at the beachside Basil’s Bar, where spectators can sip sundowners while listening to the music of renowned blues players from around the world, including the San   guitarist and singer Joe Louis Walker. Festivalgoers should be on the lookout for other attendees, both famous and not, giving impromptu shows Mick Jagger and Michael Kors have jumped on stage in past years to belt out the blues before a stunned crowd. On the classical music scene, a prestigious orchestra celebrates a big birthday while another is born. In Austria, the Vienna Philharmonic is marking its 175th anniversary with more than 100 concerts throughout the year, including the free and   Summer Night Concert Schönbrunn on May 25, in the Baroque gardens of Vienna’s Schönbrunn Palace, and four opera productions at the Salzburg Festival in Salzburg from July 21 to Aug. 30, most notably “Aida,” in which the Russian superstar soprano Anna Netrebko will sing the title role. And in Germany, Hamburg anticipates a January opening for the Elbphilharmonie, a striking new building set atop a former warehouse, with a glass facade, a scalloped roofline and two concert halls. Festivities at the new cultural landmark will unfold all year, like the ¡Viva Beethoven! series, March 19 to 23, when the highly regarded Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel will conduct. In Montreal, traditional opera takes on a contemporary edge with “Another Brick in the Wall,” on select dates from March 11 to 24 the production honors the city’s 375th anniversary and is based on Pink Floyd’s 1979 album “The Wall. The band’s chief songwriter, Roger Waters, collaborated with Opéra de Montréal on the work, which is inspired by his life. There are stories of isolation and the destruction of love, and it promises to be   and emotional, just the way a captivating opera should be."
"Getting Around by Rail, Sail or Foot - The New York Times",New York Times,Elaine Glusac,2017-01-05,"Whether by train, ship or   trail, transit alternatives are poised to proliferate in 2017. Midyear, the Brightline express train in South Florida is expected to open, linking Miami and West Palm Beach. When it’s finished in 2019, travelers can make the trip between Miami and Orlando in three hours, while driving takes four. The terminus at the new downtown MiamiCentral station will include a food hall known as Central Fare. In Switzerland, the Gotthard Base Tunnel, the world’s longest and deepest railway passage, ceremonially opened last June, but officially opened in December. Eventually the   tunnel through the Alps will cut 45 minutes off the trip between Zurich and Lugano. Offering more leisurely tours, the luxury sleeper train Belmond Andean Explorer will begin in May, linking Cusco, in the Peruvian Andes, to Lake Titicaca and Arequipa. The itinerary takes two nights, but the company, which also operates the   Belmond Hiram Bingham trains to Machu Picchu, will offer   trips between Cusco and Lake Titicaca. Japan welcomed its newest   train, Hokkaido Shinkansen, last March, traveling between Tokyo and the northern Hokkaido island in just over four hours. This spring, the   Train Suite   will offer   luxury tours in sleeper cars that will travel from Tokyo to the Tohoku and Hokkaido regions. Among 2017 cruise ship launches in the mega class, the   MSC Meraviglia from Europe’s MSC Cruises, coming in the summer to the Mediterranean, will be among the largest at sea, with a   dome featuring light shows in the central promenade, a   bowling alley and entertainment by Cirque du Soleil. In November, the line will introduce another large ship, the   MSC Seaside, sailing   between Miami and the Caribbean. In March, Celebrity Cruises plans to add two small ships to its fleet, both sailing in the Galápagos Islands. The   Celebrity Xperience will offer trips lasting from seven to 13 nights, providing snorkeling gear, wet suits and binoculars to guests. A smaller craft, the Celebrity Xploration, will accommodate 16 guests. Lindblad Expeditions will introduce its first newly built ship, the   National Geographic Quest, in June in the Inside Passage of Alaska, with kayaks, paddle boards and landing craft for ventures into the wild. The   sailing ships of Star Clippers only look retro. The line’s newly built Flying Clipper, making its debut late in 2017, will be powered by 32 sails, and it can carry 300 passengers. The   luxury line Silversea will add the   Silver Muse in April in the Mediterranean. Highlights include larger and connecting suites for friends and family, and eight restaurants, including French, Japanese and one that encourages diners to cook for themselves on heated lava stones. Among river launches, Uniworld Boutique River Cruise Collection will begin the       Joie de Vivre in France in March. Crystal River Cruises will unveil the Crystal Bach on the Danube in June and the Crystal Mahler on the Rhine in August. Both will accommodate 106 guests and include butler service, five restaurants and lounges and a spa. Crystal has also announced it will start Crystal AirCruise in 2017: private jet trips aboard its   Boeing  . The inaugural trip ($159, 000 a person) circumnavigates the globe over 27 days, beginning Aug. 31, via Peninsula Hotels. Canada aims to celebrate the 150th anniversary of its confederation by completing its transcontinental Great Trail, a   or roughly   multiuse recreational trail linking Newfoundland in the east to British Columbia in the west, with northern spurs to the Yukon and the Northwest Territories."
5 Must-See Shows if You’re in New York This Month - The New York Times,New York Times,Charles Isherwood,2017-01-25,"Broadway shows often fold their tents at the end of the year, fearing the winter blues at the box office. But this year a few shows of note are holding on, at least for a week or two. You’ve got a few more days to catch Stephen Karam’s gorgeous “The Humans,” last season’s Tony winner for best play (ending on Jan. 15) and even fewer to jump on the exhilarating emotional roller coaster that is the sublime revival of the musical “Falsettos” (ending on Sunday). Looking further ahead, here are other notable shows and events I’d put at the top of my    list. The first of the majestic   cycle of plays written by the great August Wilson, this drama set in the 1970s (and written in 1979) was, until now, the only piece of the cycle not to be produced on Broadway. A classic Wilson ensemble drama, about a group of gypsy cab drivers in the Hill District of Pittsburgh, the new Manhattan Theater Club production is directed by Ruben   who has both appeared in and directed Wilson’s plays  —   notably the superb recent revival of “The Piano Lesson” from the Signature Theater. (In previews for a Jan. 19 opening at the Samuel J. Friedman Theater.) Normally I frown on theater as a rarefied form of stargazing. But with a star as luminous as Cate Blanchett, I will grant an exception. And, of course, Ms. Blanchett, who graces this new adaptation of “Platonov,” an early Chekhov play, is not merely a movie star burnishing her reputation with a Broadway debut. During the past decade she has made regular, acclaimed appearances on the New York stage, in productions imported from the Sydney Theater Company (as is this one). An unwieldy drama about the familiar Chekhovian concerns  —   lives full of regret, stomachs bloated with vodka  —   the play has been moved from Russia in the 19th century to Russia in the late 20th century for this version by Andrew Upton, Ms. Blanchett’s husband. The esteemed Australian actor Richard Roxburgh is Platonov. (In previews for a Sunday opening at the Barrymore Theater.) I have been saving this lovable classic as a cure for the   blues. The small but enterprising Irish Rep first produced this delicious musical whimsy, with a glorious, multihued score by Burton Lane and E. Y. Harburg, a dozen years ago, with Melissa Errico as the ingénue, Sharon (she who wonders “How Are Things in Glocca Morra? ”). The seemingly ageless Ms. Errico, I am delighted to report, is unfurling her silvery soprano once again in this revival, directed by the company’s artistic director, Charlotte Moore. (Through Jan. 29 at the Irish Repertory Theater.) [Read the review] This is not a single show (as downtown theatergoers will, of course, know) but a whole feast of international theater, presented by the Public Theater at its home base and elsewhere. Along with P. S. 122’s Coil and other festivals, it has come to make January a dizzying smorgasbord of experimental theater. Highlights this year include a new production from one of my favorite companies, the imaginative 600 Highwaymen, presenting “The Fever,” which is said to be “performed in complete collaboration with the audience. ” Bring your tap shoes  —   or at least a willingness to blast your way through the fourth wall on a regular basis. (Various locations,  .) Martin McDonagh’s     was the first of his trilogy of plays set in the impoverished Irish village of the title. It returns in a   production from the Druid Theater, the company that first made a splash internationally with a pungent production that ultimately moved to Broadway. Once again the company’s longtime chief, Garry Hynes, directs. And Marie Mullen, who won a Tony Award as the embittered daughter of a manipulative terror of a mother, with the aptly monstrous name Mag, now takes on that formidable role. (Begins performances at the Brooklyn Academy of Music on Jan. 11.)"
Remaking Kennedy Airport Is Governor’s Next Big Plan - The New York Times,New York Times,Patrick McGeehan,2017-01-05,"Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York said on Wednesday that with a complete overhaul of La Guardia Airport underway, he wants to rebuild New York City’s other airport, John F. Kennedy International. Mr. Cuomo outlined a plan to spend more than $10 billion modernizing Kennedy’s terminals and improving the highway and transit systems connected to the airport. He did not provide a timetable for the plan or say specifically where all of the money would come from. “The next step is to tackle J. F. K. because La Guardia isn’t enough,” Mr. Cuomo said, speaking at a meeting of the Association for a Better New York, a business group, in Manhattan. “We need to build a new airport at J. F. K. and go through the same process as we did with La Guardia. ” In promoting big infrastructure projects, including the Second Avenue subway, which opened Sunday, Mr. Cuomo is building his legacy in New York, and perhaps raising his national profile. The plans offered by Mr. Cuomo on Wednesday suggest that he does not intend to stop trying to impose his will on the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates La Guardia and J. F. K. The authority’s commissioners are scheduled to meet on Thursday to vote on a $30 billion   spending plan that includes only about $1 billion for improvements at J. F. K. When Mr. Cuomo formed an advisory group in 2015 to study how to improve J. F. K. he said the panel would make recommendations to the authority. But the authority’s chairman, John J. Degnan, did not see the panel’s final report until Tuesday. “We await an opportunity to review the details of the governor’s proposal,” Mr. Degnan said on Wednesday. “We will have to evaluate it against other compelling capital needs identified by the Port Authority, both within other airports and within other operations that we oversee. ” Mr. Degnan, an appointee of Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, a Republican, has been at odds with Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, over the authority’s spending priorities. The agency also operates the main commuter bus terminal in Manhattan and Newark Liberty International Airport. Mr. Cuomo pushed for $2. 5 billion in the capital plan for improvements at the New York airports, possibly including an AirTrain link from New York City’s subway system to La Guardia. Mr. Cuomo’s advisory panel suggested that most of the rest of the money  —   up to $7 billion  —   could come from private sources, including airlines that use J. F. K. Kennedy is a collection of   terminals, some of which were built, at least in part, by the airlines that occupy them. JetBlue Airways and the authority split the cost of building Terminal 5, which opened in 2008. Delta Air Lines has spent more than $1 billion in the recent years to improve its facilities at Terminals 2 and 4. At La Guardia, the authority has committed $600 million to the rebuilding of Terminals C and D against an estimated cost of about $4 billion. That investment would come on top of a $4 billion rebuilding of the Central Terminal Building there, which began last year. Mr. Cuomo hopes to entice airlines to make similar investments at J. F. K. to compete for customers. He challenged airlines to make offers, saying Delta had called him at 5:45 a. m. on Wednesday. Mr. Cuomo did not mention seeking federal financing.   Donald J. Trump has said he plans to make an ambitious investment in infrastructure a priority of his administration. As part of Mr. Cuomo’s plan for J. F. K. Matthew Driscoll, New York State’s transportation commissioner, said his agency would spend as much as $2 billion to improve the flow of traffic to and from the airport. The changes would include adding a lane to the Van Wyck Expressway and widening ramps at the busy interchange in Kew Gardens, Queens, which Mr. Driscoll said handles 250, 000 vehicles per day. Thomas F. Prendergast, chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, said that transit agencies would explore creating a   ride between Manhattan and J. F. K. Travelers must now switch to the AirTrain from the subway or Long Island Rail Road, a transfer that Mr. Prendergast described as “schlepping with your luggage. ” Though New York City owns the land under J. F. K. no one from City Hall attended Mr. Cuomo’s speech. “Investments in New York City’s airports are vitally important to our region’s   development,” said Melissa Grace, a spokeswoman for Mayor Bill de Blasio. “We look forward to hearing more details about the plans for J. F. K. in the months to come. ”"
Cyberwar for Sale - The New York Times,New York Times,Mattathias Schwartz,2017-01-22,"On the morning of May 18, 2014, Violeta Lagunes was perplexed by a series of strange messages that appeared in her Gmail inbox. It was Election Day to choose the leadership of Mexico’s   Partido Acción Nacional, or PAN, and Lagunes, a former federal congresswoman, was holding a strategy meeting in her office in Puebla city. The emails seemed harmless, at least at first. One appeared to come from the account of a trusted colleague. It asked her to download and review a document. Lagunes clicked on the link, but it seemed to be broken, so she wrote back to her colleague and asked him to send it again. Elsewhere in her inbox was an email from Google warning her that someone had tried to log in to her account. Meanwhile, she began to receive phone calls from PAN allies, who claimed that they had received emails from Lagunes’s account that she did not remember sending. Now Lagunes was worried. Around 1 o’clock, she called the colleague who appeared to have emailed her. She reached him at a restaurant, where he was finishing lunch with other campaign allies. “I did not send you an email,” he insisted. A consultant with the campaign  —   who asked to remain anonymous in order to preserve his relationships with other candidates  —   overheard the conversation. He knew of other campaign workers who had been receiving similar messages: emails with vague subject lines, asking the recipient to review a document or click a link. The campaign, he realized, had been hacked. In the vote for party leader, Lagunes and her allies in Puebla  —   a   drive southeast from Mexico City  —   were supporting the challenger, a senator who promised to return the party to its conservative roots. But the incumbent was backed by Puebla’s powerful governor, Rafael Moreno Valle. One of Mexico’s rising political stars, Moreno Valle is close to Mexico’s president, Enrique Peña Nieto, and has forged an alliance between PAN and Nieto’s centrist Partido Revolucionario Institucional, or PRI, long the dominant force in Mexican politics. Since winning the governorship in 2010, Moreno Valle’s opponents say, his ambitions have grown, and he has resorted to increasingly harsh measures to keep Puebla state  —   including members of his own party  —   under control. “In the beginning, the governor was   and respectful,” Rafael Micalco, a former leader of PAN in Puebla state, told me. “When he became governor, he transformed. Now he controls the party through threats. ” This race to retain control of the party leadership in 2014 was a crucial test for the governor, who was rumored to be considering a run for Mexico’s presidency in 2018. (This past September, Moreno Valle publicly announced his intent to run.) Clashes between the two camps were especially intense in Puebla, where backers of the challenger, Ernesto Cordero, claimed that the governor was using public money to support the incumbent, Gustavo Madero, though the governor’s office has denied these charges. Shortly before the election, Madero’s campaign manager said that Cordero’s side was trying to undermine the legitimacy of the process. “Their strategy is clear from the outset,” he said in an interview with a Mexican magazine. “’u2009‘If I win, good. If not, I was cheated. ’’u2009” After Lagunes’s call on Election Day, her colleagues rushed from the restaurant back to their local headquarters, a hotel conference room that they had nicknamed “the bunker. ” All morning, they had been trying to reach their field network, a group of 40 Cordero canvassers who were working to get out the vote in Puebla state. But the field network seemed to have gone dark. Few of the canvassers were even answering their phones. Hackers, the team concluded, must have found the list of the canvassers’ names and phone numbers  —   widely circulated by email within the campaign  —   and begun to intimidate them. “The day before,” the consultant told me, the field network was “motivated and eager to do this work. After the hack, it was very hard to reach them. The few who did answer said that they had received phone calls saying that their lives were at stake. They were worried that if they went out, they or their families would get hurt. ” According to another worker on Cordero’s campaign, who also requested anonymity, citing fear of reprisal, the message to the canvassers was simple and direct: “We know who you are. If you don’t want any trouble, shut down your cellphone and stop your activity. ” The worker added: “It’s an authoritarian regime. ” Madero won the election, with 57 percent of the 162, 792 votes cast over all. In Puebla, his margin was substantially larger, roughly 74 percent. Cordero’s team decided not to contest the result. They had suspicions about how they were hacked. But it would be another year before any evidence emerged. Their political enemies, leaked documents seemed to show, had built a spying operation using software made by an Italian firm called Hacking Team  —   just one of many private companies that, largely below public notice, have sprung up to aid governments in surveilling the private lives of individual citizens. The industry claims that its products comply with local laws and are used to fight crime and terror. But in many countries around the world, these tools have proved to be equally adept at political espionage. On average, an American office worker sends and receives roughly 120 emails per day, a number that grows with each passing year. The ubiquity and utility of email has turned it into a   record of our    lives, rich with mundane and potentially embarrassing details, stored in a perpetual archive, accessible from anywhere on earth and protected, in some cases, by nothing more than a single password. In the case of Violeta Lagunes, her email login represented a point of vulnerability, a seam where the digital walls protecting her campaign were at the mercy of her human judgment  —   specifically, whether she could determine if a message from an apparently reputable source was real or fake. Nearly two years later, John Podesta, chairman of Hillary Clinton’s campaign, was faced with a similar judgment call. An email warned him that someone in Ukraine had tried to access his Gmail account and asked him to click on a button and reset his password. His senior adviser forwarded the email to one of the campaign’s technology experts. “This is a legitimate email,” he replied, in what the expert later would clarify was a simple typing error on his part he meant to say it was not legitimate. “The gmail one is REAL,” the senior adviser wrote to Podesta and another aide. And so, like Lagunes, Podesta fell into a trap. The button appeared to lead to an official Google page, but it was in fact a meticulously personalized fake, with a domain address linked to a remote cluster of atolls in the South Pacific. The details were designed to trick Podesta into entering his password. This technique is known as “spear phishing. ” It is an especially potent weapon against companies and political organizations because it needs to succeed only one time, against one target. After that, attackers can use the trusted identity of the first compromised account to more easily lure colleagues into opening infected attachments or clicking on malicious links. Not only will a working email password yield years of intraoffice chatter, invoices,   bills and confidential memos it can often be leveraged into control of other personal accounts  —   Twitter, Facebook, Amazon  —   and even access to company servers and internet domains. The Podesta and Lagunes episodes are far from the only cases in which hackers have used information from stolen emails as a weapon against an entire institution. The 2009 “Climategate” incident, which exposed troves of emails from prominent climate researchers, began when hackers remotely broke into servers at a British university with the help of illicitly obtained passwords. The 2014 hack of internal Sony files, which American officials attributed to the North Korean government, began with a series of   emails that attackers then used to dig deeper into Sony’s servers. Each hack yielded the most private thoughts and deeds from the members of each respective organization: their blunt insults, their quashed dissents, their   plans, their smarmy flattery, all chronicled in time down to the hundredth of the second when the author clicked “send. ” In an earlier era, the hackers might have had to engage in riskier behavior, like bribery or burglary. Now, in many cases, all they had to do was send along a link. The White House, C. I. A. and F. B. I. have all claimed that, based on classified evidence, they can trace the hacks of Podesta’s email account (and other hacks of people close to the Clinton campaign) back to the Russian government. But with the rise of private firms like Hacking Team, penetrating the email accounts of political opponents does not require the kind of money and expertise available to major powers. A   website called Insider Surveillance lists more than a dozen companies selling   ethical malware, including   Hacking Team and the German firms FinFisher and Trovicor. Compared with conventional arms, surveillance software is subject to few trade controls a recent attempt by the United States to regulate it under a   pact called the Wassenaar Arrangement failed. “The technology is morally neutral,” says Joel Brenner, a former inspector general of the National Security Agency. “The same program that you use to monitor your babysitter might be used by Bashar Assad or Abdel Fattah   to keep track of whomever they don’t like. ” Hacking Team has fewer than 50 employees, but it has customers all over the world. According to internal documents, its espionage tool, which is called the Remote Control System, or R. C. S. can be licensed for as little as $200, 000 a year  —   well within the budget of a provincial strongman. After it has been surreptitiously installed on a target’s computer or phone, the Remote Control System can invisibly eavesdrop on everything: text messages, emails, phone and Skype calls, location data and so on. Whereas the N. S. A. ’s   programs grab data in transit from switching rooms and undersea cables, the R. C. S. acquires it at the source, right off a target’s device, before it can be encrypted. It carries out an invisible, digitized equivalent of a    . The United States government is almost certainly the world’s most formidable repository of hacking talent, but its most powerful cyberweapons are generally reserved for intelligence agencies and the military. This might explain why, according to company documents, at least two federal   agencies have been Hacking Team clients: the F. B. I. beginning in 2011, and the Drug Enforcement Administration, beginning in 2012. The F. B. I. contract paid Hacking Team more than $700, 000 the D. E. A. appears to have used the software to go after targets in Colombia. Documents show that the company has also sold its software to some of the world’s most repressive governments. Some, like those of Honduras, Ethiopia, Bahrain, Morocco, Egypt and Saudi Arabia, are Western allies. Other countries, like Uzbekistan and Turkey, have a more troubled relationship. A few are openly hostile to the West. Between 2012 and 2014, Hacking Team was paid nearly one million euros by the government of Sudan, a United   state sponsor of terrorism. Even more notable, in light of recent events, is the   relationship that Hacking Team carried on with the F. S. B. one of Russia’s main intelligence agencies. As with Puebla, Hacking Team used a middleman, a research agency called Kvant, to handle its sales to Russia. Between 2012 and 2014, the agency paid Hacking Team 451, 000 euros to license the Remote Control System. Hacking Team claims that it draws the line at customers who commit “gross   abuses” and that it sells exclusively to governments operating within the laws of their own countries. In at least one case, David Vincenzetti, Hacking Team’s founder and chief executive, told a salesman to hold off on a potential Mexican client. “We sell to official, governmental LEAs”  —     agencies  —   “and security agencies ONLY,” Vincenzetti wrote in an email. But at other times, a more casual attitude prevailed inside the company. “If one sells sandwiches to Sudan, he is not subject, as far as my knowledge goes, to the law,” one Hacking Team lawyer wrote in an internal email. “Hacking Team should be treated like a sandwich vendor. ” When asked about its arrangements in various countries, the company responded that it “does not comment on confidential business dealings. ” Its American spokesman, Eric Rabe, did tell me that neither Russia nor Sudan is a current Hacking Team customer. (The relationships, Rabe wrote, ended in 2014, Russia because “the Putin government evolved from one considered friendly to the West to a more hostile regime” and Sudan “because of concerns about the country’s ability to use the system in accordance with the H. T. contract. ”) Separately, the company confirmed that the state of Puebla was, in fact, a former client. Until recently, most of what was known about the world of private surveillance companies was a matter of hearsay and speculation. Industry players kept a low profile, operating discreetly from rented offices and meeting potential customers in person a few times a year at carefully screened trade shows. This is why it was so notable when, in July 2015, an unusual tweet appeared in Hacking Team’s Twitter feed. “Since we have nothing to hide,” it read, “we’re publishing all our emails, files and source code. ” Then came another tweet, with links to a downloadable file called Hacked Team. The file was huge, 420 gigabytes of material scraped from Hacking Team’s internal servers. Inside were 33 folders containing the company’s contracts, payroll documents, invoices, legal memos,   records and a   cache of email correspondence from the chief executive on down. Hacking Team had itself been hacked. WikiLeaks pounced on the breach and quickly uploaded the emails into a searchable database. Anyone with an internet connection could now read the chief executive joking about how his company was in the business of selling “the evilest technology on earth. ” You could browse Hacking Team’s source code, including one line using “bomb_blueprints. pdf” as a placeholder for files that might be found on a target’s device. On Reddit, an online peanut gallery formed around the   online habits of one Hacking Team engineer and his own notably weak passwords  —   HTPassword! P4ssword, Passw0rd. But the most damaging exposures in the leak by far were Hacking Team’s client list and the names of some of the clients’ targets. In South Korea, newspapers focused on evidence suggesting that Hacking Team’s software had helped the nation’s intelligence service rig an election after the leak, one agent who had reportedly used the system there committed suicide. In Ecuador, a magazine found an email with seven phone numbers that the government appeared to have targeted with the R. C. S. Three belonged to lawmakers a fourth to the mayor of Quito all four were members of the opposition party. With the source code for the Remote Control System now public, the company and its clients had to stop using it temporarily. By the end of the year, though, Hacking Team had updated its product and was trying to rebuild its reputation. I was curious whether a company that profited from online breaches could recover from its own. Eric Rabe, the American spokesman, sounded eager to meet me for coffee in Philadelphia. A grandfather and former   anchor, he exudes   credibility. “If you disagree with someone on the internet,” he said, of the Hacked Team files, with a wave of his hand, “there’s no need to have a   debate. Just go destroy them. ” A couple of months later, I went to Milan to visit Hacking Team’s headquarters, a stately gray apartment building with boxes of limp flowers adorning a few of its sooty sills. Waiting to demonstrate the company’s software were Rabe Philippe Vinci, a company vice president and Alessandro Scarafile, a young engineer. Scarafile had gathered a Dell desktop computer and three smartphones: iPhone, BlackBerry and Android. The screen from his own laptop, which represented the console of a client intelligence agency, was projected on the wall. Several icons represented the various streams of data that could potentially be acquired by gaining control of the target’s computer: images from   cameras, sound from   mikes, screenshots, detailed records of applications opened and bitcoins transferred, a continuous log of location with latitude and longitude, and logs of address books, calendars, phone calls, Skype calls and passwords, as well as websites visited. A key logger recorded every key that was pressed. It was a lot to keep track of. Two other views, called “line of events” and “line of actions,” assembled the information into chronological order. Scarafile, who was playing both the customer and the target, or “bad guy,” turned on the Dell. Judging by the background on the desktop, a gothic scene framed by castlelike silhouettes, our target seemed to be planning a terrorist attack from Transylvania. There are three methods, Scarafile explained, for getting the Remote Control System onto a target’s device. Customers can gain physical access to the device and then infect it with a USB stick or memory card. They can beam the R. C. S. in over a   network. Or they can send the customer an email and get him to click on an infected attachment  —   usually a file from a   program like Microsoft Word or PowerPoint. Scarafile did not mention a fourth method, one described by Hacking Team’s critics and referred to in its internal emails: the installation of the R. C. S. through a more elaborate process called “network injection,” which is said to involve pinpointing the target’s exact location on the internet, observing the person as he orders up, say, a YouTube cat video, and then serving up a doctored version of the same page, one with the desired cat video playing in the foreground  —   YouTube logo and all  —   as the R. C. S. discreetly rolls in past the digital gates. Whatever the method of infection, the malicious code, known as an “agent,” then communicates with its masters anonymously, its dispatches routed through a series of dedicated servers scattered around the world. Even if the target gets suspicious and figures out that something is wrong, this chain of servers makes it nearly impossible for him to figure out exactly who is using Hacking Team’s product to spy on him. For the demo, Scarafile opted for the third method, which he referred to as “a bit of social engineering. ” Using the customer’s computer, he sent the target an email with a Word file attached. Then he returned to the target’s computer and   on it, just as Lagunes had clicked on the link in her inbox. “From now on,” he said, “this system is currently infected, or monitored, by the Remote Control System. ” It would remain so even if the suspect turned off his machine or logged out. On the timeline, the target appeared as a stubbly lout in an undershirt, named “Jimmy Page . .. head of the terrorist cell. ” Using Jimmy Page’s Dell, Scarafile logged into Page’s Gmail, Facebook and Twitter. He opened up Skype, perused Page’s criminal colleagues (Don Corleone, Harry Potter, Keyser Soze) and left one of them a voice mail message from Page’s phone. Accessing a USB drive attached to the infected computer, Scarafile opened an encrypted file that turned out to contain an order to “kill David Vincenzetti. ” R. C. S. captured it all, including periodic snapshots of Scarafile, as Page, at work. “I don’t like the words ‘inject’ and ‘infect,’’u2009” Vinci, the vice president, said. “R. C. S. is deploying the agent into the device of the target because you want to monitor some of his activities. Exactly the way that law enforcement is listening to some of your phone calls, right?” Rabe had told me that Vincenzetti was “a fighter,” and his combative side was apparent from a collage of magazine clippings and printouts taped to the wall beside his desk  —   a sort of mood board, like those used in the advertising industry to gather inspiration before the unveiling of a new brand. Vincenzetti’s mood board, though, wasn’t about sneakers or cola. It was about the global struggle for power, which he seemed to envision as one big conflict, a battle between the good guys and the bad guys. On the good side was a photo of the bell that aspiring Navy SEALs can ring should they want to quit the program during Hell Week, and a quote from another entrepreneur that “business is war. ” On the bad side, Vincenzetti had taped up a satellite image showing one of the hottest zones of international tension, the artificial islands rising in the South China Sea, a line of terrestrial pawns advancing China’s sphere of influence. Beside it was a chart about Iran, depicting how the country could continue to advance its nuclear program despite the recent   deal. “I think the Iran deal is just terrible,” Vincenzetti said, and then added, sarcastically, “Oh, it’s such a very peaceful expansion. Very peaceful. ” “That is not an official company position,” Rabe interjected. Vincenzetti, now 48, is a familiar type  —   a ferociously competitive, driven entrepreneur whose existence is organized around his work. He has a wife, who was born in Morocco, and no children. His small,   eyes can make him seem sleepily blasé. On the morning we met at Hacking Team’s offices, he wore jeans, a   cardigan and a striped shirt, unbuttoned to midchest. He seemed more comfortable on his feet than sitting down. As we talked in a conference room, he periodically leapt to his feet and stalked around the table, considering in turn the espresso machine, the view from the window, a case of bottled water. “If I wanted to break into this room, how would I do it?” he asked. “There is a door, and there are two windows. ” He pressed his hands against the glass panes. “The perimeter is the first thing you must secure,” he continued. Securing data was what he did earlier in his career. Now he had moved on. “If you cannot break into a bank, you cannot protect a bank. So when you are in security, really there is no difference between thinking offensively and defensively. ” In the   Vincenzetti’s parents, a salesman and a schoolteacher, bought him a Commodore 64, one of the earliest personal computers. He soon created a   clone, a Tron   game and a   adventure game. As a   student at the University of Milan in the ’90s, he became fascinated by cryptography he corresponded with programmers around the world about new cryptographic theories and wrote code for email encryption. In his senior year, he was appointed to administer the university’s internal network, a post that was usually reserved for a graduate student. Vincenzetti remembers these early days as a time when “everything was free and no one was trying to harm you. We were wide open and accessible. All the best were called hackers, and I was a hacker. ” Vincenzetti left university early and founded three companies, all of them focused on defensive cybersecurity. After he founded Hacking Team in 2003, he tried to sell his services to Italian police agencies but found them skeptical that Mafiosi and other   criminals would ever bother to encrypt their communications. In Italy, the police were also used to getting whatever they needed through wiretaps, arranged with varying degrees of formality through their contacts at telecommunications firms. But after the 2004 Madrid train bombings, which were coordinated via cellphones and the internet, police officers and intelligence agents not just in Italy but all across Europe became interested in contracting with   vendors, part of an emerging arms race over   encryption. The growth of Skype made it easy for users to encrypt their communications, and the authorities were eager to pay for countermeasures like the Remote Control System. Singapore, Hacking Team’s first   client, signed on in 2008. The company’s Middle Eastern business took off in 2011, a boom that coincided with the beginning of the Arab Spring. By then, Hacking Team had entered a growth phase, its business driven in part by demand among   governments for   surveillance tools. According to two former employees, the company held talks with Col. Muammar  ’s chief security officer, who wanted to build a countrywide   scheme that could be embedded in every Libyan cellphone. (Rabe would not confirm or deny that this meeting occurred, and added: “The company often receives requests to provide services that it does not have available or would sell. ”) The United Nations, which prohibits the export of “electronic weaponry” to Sudan, has investigated Hacking Team’s activities there. Nineteen members of the Italian Parliament signed a petition raising the question of whether the Egyptian government might have used the R. C. S. to track Giulio Regeni, a    Italian student who appears to have been under government surveillance and whose mutilated body turned up on the side of a road in Egypt last year. Hacking Team’s software has not been connected to the case, but the company has done business with the current Egyptian regime. As part of the controversy, the Italian government temporarily revoked Hacking Team’s global export license, so that for several months the company had to file a separate application for each of its customers outside the European Union. (When I brought up the Regeni case with Rabe, he called the dead student “this Italian national who got himself killed in Egypt. ” He cited Hacking Team’s official policy  —   the company neither knows nor desires to know the identities of the people its customers choose to target. “There is no evidence that Hacking Team’s software had anything to do with Regeni’s demise,” Rabe said.) All Hacking Team customers sign contracts agreeing to comply with local laws. The company says that it vets potential customers and studies reports from journalists and   groups, looking for “objective evidence or credible concerns” that its products are being abused. But when it comes to Hacking Team’s own interactions with customers, leaked documents suggest that employees have sometimes turned a blind eye. In the case of the Puebla government and other Latin American customers, Hacking Team employees appeared to ignore warnings suggesting that the Remote Control System was being used to gather intelligence on the political opposition. On multiple occasions, customers emailed Hacking Team attachments with   content, including polling data, party registration forms and invitations addressed to and signed by elected officials. Rather than ask what these files had to do with fighting crime and drug trafficking, Hacking Team   members simply emailed them back, as requested, with an embedded “exploit,” turning the document into a surveillance tool to be used against whomever it was sent on to. Asked about these cases, Rabe replied that customers “are not supposed to be using it for political purposes, but I don’t think it’s reasonable to expect that an Italian computer programmer,” i. e. a support technician, “would have seen these files and known what was going on. . .. I think that’s a stretch, that an Italian software guy could know that an individual is a dissident. ” Hacking Team’s most persistent critic is Citizen Lab, a research group at the University of Toronto’s Munk School of Global Affairs. Before the Hacked Team leak, Citizen Lab documented cases in which Hacking Team software turned up on the devices of activists in Morocco and the United Arab Emirates, as well as an   journalist in Alexandria, Va. Ronald Deibert, Citizen Lab’s director, told me that Hacking Team “is a company that appears to have no internal controls on abuse of its products. ” When I asked Vincenzetti about this, he said that Citizen Lab was motivated by money, noting that the group won a   grant a week after publishing a report on Hacking Team’s sales to Ethiopia. “Their identity,” he said, “is: ‘I am the defender of free speech, I am the defender of liberty and democracy.’ O. K. So am I. So is every rational guy. ” If Citizen Lab really cared about good and evil, he said, it would be fighting China and Iran. Almost immediately after the Hacked Team documents went online, they were being pored over by R3D, a Mexico     group. Luis Fernando García, R3D’s director, says that intimidation and online surveillance have increased under Peña Nieto’s presidency, and he took notice when Citizen Lab, in 2014, released a report that traced a chain of servers associated with Hacking Team that routed data through Hong Kong, London, Amsterdam and Atlanta before terminating somewhere inside Mexico. Exactly who was on the receiving end of the traffic and what they were doing with it was unknown at the time, but now R3D’s team recognized that this could be their chance to find out. Shortly thereafter, R3D published three invoices from the Hacked Team cache showing that one state government  —   that of Jalisco, on the Pacific Coast  —   had paid the company nearly half a million euros for the Remote Control System. Soon other documents were found in the leak to implicate several more states, including Puebla, though most of the states denied ever using the software. (Jalisco later admitted to purchasing the system, which it claimed was for its prosecutor’s office.) The story failed to get much traction in the Mexican press, except in Puebla, after R3D connected with Lado B, a small   collective there. The site’s name translates to “B Side,” as in the back of a hit single  —   symbolizing its dedication to telling stories that would otherwise go untold. Lado B’s editor, Ernesto Aroche, was not surprised that Puebla’s government had been using the Remote Control System. In Moreno Valle’s six years as governor there, he has spent lavishly on new surveillance systems, including multiple “security arches,”   structures that scrutinize traffic with video cameras and   and whose cost had raised some questions in the local press. Beginning in 2013, Aroche began noticing solicitations on the   website for hidden cameras and other spying equipment. When he filed a   request about them, the government’s form response indicated that these orders had never been filled, but Aroche was skeptical, given the mounting evidence that Moreno Valle’s administration had begun using its security apparatus for political purposes. There were periodic   of homes belonging to dissident politicians and journalists, with the burglars sometimes taking little besides their victims’ laptops. Politicians would answer calls from unknown numbers, only to hear their own taped conversations played back to them. Another journalist, Fernando Maldonado, received an unmarked envelope full of what were purportedly transcripts of 400 private phone calls made by Puebla politicians. As Aroche and R3D sifted through the Hacked Team file dump, they discovered that the files on Puebla had more detail than those dealing with Hacking Team’s other Mexican accounts. The Puebla client often wrote emails asking for help with infecting a particular document with a malicious virus. Some of these came from an account  —   soporteuiamx@gmail. com  —   that also appears in many of Hacking Team’s internal support tickets. One of those tickets documents a client’s request for help in infecting an attachment: an invitation to attend an event for a Mexican political organization, signed by Violeta Lagunes and addressed to another party colleague opposed to the governor. Aroche interviewed politicians and journalists who were on the receiving end of the infected emails contained in the Hacked Team trove. According to a 2015 article that Lado B published in conjunction with a politics website, the Puebla group sent Hacking Team at least 47 requests to infect specific files that it would then forward on to their targets. Almost all of those files had to do with political issues. Going through the Hacked Team materials, Aroche found the name of a Puebla government employee who seemed to be working within the spying operation. “Before, we had been talking about ghosts,” Aroche told me. “Now, we could prove it. We started putting names on the actors. ” More than a year later, there have been no political repercussions for the governor or his allies in Puebla. I met Aroche this fall at the Lado B offices, a small room facing a courtyard in a crumbling stone building from Puebla’s colonial days. The only suggestion of Lado B’s presence was a small sticker on the window. Inside, Aroche was thumbing through an envelope of documents that he had wrung out of the state government. Two redacted contracts signed by Puebla officials showed an arrangement between the state government and a company called Sym Servicios Integrales, which Aroche’s reporting had identified as an intermediary for Hacking Team. The details of what had been purchased were redacted. “These contracts demonstrate that the Puebla government had a commercial relationship with this company,” Aroche said. “I’m sorry if they’re a little bit stained  —   I dropped some coffee on them. ” (Sym Servicios Integrales says it “never sold H. T. technology to the state of Puebla. ”) In a brief written statement from Sagrario Conde Valerio, a spokeswoman, the government of Puebla denied allegations of spying and claimed that “no relationship exists nor has ever existed between the government of Puebla and the company ‘Hacking Team. ’’u2009” The government declined to respond further to a list of questions. But a former official from Moreno Valle’s administration claimed to me that more than $1 million was being diverted from the state budget each year to fund the   unit. Documents from the Hacked Team archive indicate that Hacking Team received an order from the government of Puebla for 415, 000 euros in the spring of 2013, and that Hacking Team booked hotel rooms for three of its associates who traveled to Puebla in May of that year. Some of the R. C. S. training, I was told, took place in a green building on a residential street. When I visited the purported site this fall, lettering above the door said that the building was once a school. Now it had bars across the door and mirrored windows. Neighbors told me it had been abandoned for several months. “People would come and go,” one woman said. “They were very secretive. They would drop off equipment, take away equipment. Then one day, about a year ago, they came and took everything away and left. ” Another neighbor said that he often saw a   car parked in front of the house and a man with a limp entering and leaving  —   a former Mexican intelligence agent, according to someone who was present during the Hacking Team training. Mexico is Hacking Team’s biggest export market, accounting for nearly six million euros in sales, according to leaked documents. Ostensibly, the Remote Control System is intended for fighting criminals and drug traffickers there. (“There have been reports that the software was used in the apprehension of Chapo Guzman,” Rabe told me, referring to the Mexican drug lord. “I can’t confirm it. ”) The files indicate that at least seven other Mexican state governments were Hacking Team clients, but because they did not use email to the same extent as Puebla, their activities are harder to track. Multiple former Hacking Team employees told me that abuses of the software were not limited to Puebla. One former employee described having the system set up inside a mayor’s office. Katitza Rodríguez,   director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, says that Mexican law allows for interception of communication, like the wiretapping of phone lines, but it does not grant precise legal authority to use new, powerful invasive tools like those created by Hacking Team. And she argues that it is much more dangerous in Mexico than in other Western countries, where checks and balances are stronger. “This is much more intrusive than the interception of a phone call,” she said. “They are not only listening they are taking over your laptop. Mexico needs to have a full debate in Congress about what legal safeguards are needed for this kind of surveillance or if the government should be using it at all. ” The Hacked Team files indicate that in   Hacking Team opened an American subsidiary and leased office space in Reston, Va. a   drive from the C. I. A. ’s headquarters. The company drew up a “U. S. action plan,” calling for a significant North American expansion, with new hires and rounds of pitches to the Department of Justice, the United States military and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Hacking Team was also targeting another potentially lucrative market: American state and local governments. It pitched the R. C. S. to   agencies in San Bernardino, Calif. Washington New York Fort Lauderdale and Orlando. In a risk assessment commissioned by the company, lawyers advised that such sales were probably legal, so long as the product was provided “at a distance” from actual investigations and used “in the normal course of government operations. ” American expansion by companies like Hacking Team may not face much resistance from the federal government, which is becoming more accepting of electronic surveillance as part of normal police work. Last year, the Justice Department successfully changed the rules of criminal procedure, making it easier for federal agents to hack into multiple computers with a single warrant. Senator Steve Daines of Montana, who tried to block the change, complained that it gives “unlimited power for unlimited hacking. ” In a 2014 address, now referred to in cybersecurity circles as his “Going Dark” speech, the F. B. I. ’s director, James Comey, argued that the encryption built into Apple products posed a threat to public safety  —   enabling not only terrorism but also drug trafficking, child abuse and   . Instead of “a safe that can’t be cracked,” Comey wanted technology companies to lend him the combination. “The law hasn’t kept pace with technology, and this disconnect has created a significant   problem,” Comey said. “We call it ‘going dark. ’’u2009” As the United States government has argued for weaker protections around personal communications, American businesses have been spreading more powerful surveillance tools around the world. Many foreign   agencies already buy   products from SS8  —   a company backed by the storied   firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield Byers  —   as well as from the Harris Corporation, a $13 billion company based in Florida and traded on the New York Stock Exchange. At least 25 American police departments have used Harris’s Stingray device, which mimics cellphone towers and can intercept cellphone calls within 200 meters. All known sales of Stingrays to local law enforcement have been authorized by the F. B. I. which has since fought in court to keep those sales secret. In Baltimore alone, Stingrays have been used more than 4, 000 times, in routine drug investigations. Much less is known about another Harris product, the advanced Hailstorm, which is also sold to local police departments. Hailstorm is reportedly capable of implanting malware that can take control of a targeted phone, much like Hacking Team’s R. C. S. The Hacked Team documents that offer the most revealing view of the company’s ethos happen to be the most public ones. For years, as often as two or three times a day, Vincenzetti sent mass emails to hundreds of his business contacts. The recipients included numerous members of the United States military and intelligence community, as well as government employees from the city of Cincinnati and the Internal Revenue Service. In these messages, Vincenzetti often addresses this audience collectively as “gents. ” The news he cites is a reminder of how the geopolitical winds have been blowing in favor of Hacking Team and other   allies of law and order. In Vincenzetti’s world, the system is always, as George Tenet famously said about  . 11 intelligence, “blinking red”: the imploding Middle East a restive,   Russia battalions of   jihadis roaming around Europe with their encrypted thumb drives and   expertise. Against this backdrop of   danger, concerns about human rights are naïve at best. Vincenzetti’s emails vividly exploit this sense of danger and alarm. He writes about shadowy gangs of Iranian hackers using the #JeSuisCharlie hashtag to inject malware into French laptops. He celebrates the conviction of Ross Ulbricht, a. k. a. the Dread Pirate Roberts, creator of the Silk Road website. After the arrests of two Uzbek men in Brooklyn for telling informants that they wanted to join up with ISIS, Vincenzetti writes of “a very serious terrorist plot on American soil foiled. ” He went on to tap out this sales pitch: The following day, he gave a few more hints: The tone of Vincenzetti’s sales patter was strangely upbeat, especially considering his dire forecasts. It was almost as if he were in the business of selling microwave ovens or sandwiches, not tools through which the private lives of criminals (and whoever else) could be fully laid bare. Vincenzetti’s unstated equation  —   privacy is secrecy, and secrecy is terrorism  —   is less controversial than it might appear. A supportive echo can be heard in many public statements from American officials, which Vincenzetti often cut and pasted into his mass emails. The former attorney general Eric Holder called for “investigative and prosecutorial tools that allow us to be  . ” When Comey warned that “encryption threatens to lead all of us to a very dark place,” Vincenzetti forwarded it along approvingly, with the tagline: “We DO have an answer to many if not all of his concerns. ” And when, in May 2015, Comey warned of a “threat” that had “morphed” into “a chaotic spider web,” Vincenzetti sent word to his “gents” as well. One month later, an anonymous hack revealed Hacking Team’s own invisible spider web, and one year later, during the   to Election Day, came the internal emails of the Democratic Party. By then it was clear that tools for digital burglary had spread well beyond the hands of regular police officers. Comey had argued for weaker safes Vincenzetti was selling longer crowbars. They could be used to chase Jimmy Page, arrest Chapo Guzman, fight crime, smear a political opponent or just keep tabs on someone, anyone. To be hidden is to be a terrorist  —   this was the heart of his pitch. Any digital redoubt that could resist being pried open was a public risk and a private opportunity."
Why Men Don’t Want the Jobs Done Mostly by Women - The New York Times,New York Times,Claire Cain Miller,2017-01-05,"It hasn’t been a great time to be a man without a job. The jobs that have been disappearing, like machine operator, are predominantly those that men do. The occupations that are growing, like health aide, employ mostly women. One solution is for the men who have lost jobs in factories to become health aides. But while more than a fifth of American men aren’t working, they aren’t running to these new   jobs. Why? They require very different skills, and pay a lot less. They’re also seen as women’s work, which has always been devalued in the American labor market. The two occupations predicted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics to decline most quickly from 2014 to 2024 are locomotive firers, shrinking 70 percent, and vehicle electronics installers and repairers, down 50 percent. They are 96 percent and 98 percent male. Of the   jobs, many are various types of health aides, which are about 90 percent female. When men take these     jobs, they have more job security and wage growth than in   work, according to recent research. But they are paid less and feel stigmatized. “The jobs being created are very different than the jobs being eliminated,” said David Autor, an economist at M. I. T. “I’m not worried about whether there will be jobs. I’m very worried about whether there will be jobs for   adults, especially the males, who seem very reluctant to take the new jobs. ” Take Tracy Dawson, 53, a welder in St. Clair, Mo. He lost several jobs, some because his employers took the work to China and Mexico and others because the workers were replaced by robots. He has heard the promises of   jobs in the health care field: His daughter trained to be a medical technician. But he never considered it. “I ain’t gonna be a nurse I don’t have the tolerance for people,” he said. “I don’t want it to sound bad, but I’ve always seen a woman in the position of a nurse or some kind of health care worker. I see it as more of a woman’s touch. ” Also, health aides earn a median wage of $10. 50 an hour. Mr. Dawson used to earn $18 an hour making railroad traction motors. “I was a welder  —   that’s all I know how to do,” said Mr. Dawson, who is living on disability insurance because he has rheumatoid arthritis. Women were hit harder than men by the decline in   jobs, according to Mr. Autor. But they have more easily moved into the expanding occupations, and earn more college degrees than men. Women have always entered   fields  —   usually   professional ones  —   more than men enter   ones. There are now many female lawyers, but male nurses are still rare. One reason is that jobs done by women, especially caregiving jobs, have always had lower pay and lower status. Yet when men, especially white men, enter   fields, they are paid more and promoted faster than women, a phenomenon known as the glass escalator. Much of men’s resistance to   jobs is tied up in the culture of masculinity, say people who study the issue. Women are assumed to be empathetic and caring men are supposed to be strong, tough and able to support a family. “Traditional masculinity is standing in the way of   men’s employment, and I think it’s a problem,” said Andrew Cherlin, a sociologist and public policy professor at Johns Hopkins and author of “Labor’s Love Lost: The Rise and Fall of the   Family in America. ” “We have a cultural lag where our views of masculinity have not caught up to the change in the job market,” he said. But telling   men to take feminine jobs plays to their anxieties and comes off as condescending, said Joan Williams, a law professor at U. C. Hastings and author of “Reshaping the   Debate: Why Men and Class Matter. ” “White   men’s wages have plummeted, and what happens to men in that context is anxieties about whether they’re ‘real men,’ ” she said. It’s no surprise, then, that Donald J. Trump appealed to men who feel this way  —   not just his promises to bring back factory jobs, but also his machismo. Many unemployed men who did manual labor say they can’t take the time and make the effort to train for a new career because they have bills to pay. And they say they chose their original careers because they wanted to build things, not take care of people. Lawrence Katz, an economist at Harvard, has a term for this: “retrospective wait unemployment,” or “looking for the job you used to have. ” “It’s not a skill mismatch, but an identity mismatch,” he said. “It’s not that they couldn’t become a health worker, it’s that people have backward views of what their identity is. ” Jon Ray, 31, of Inez, Ky. was an electrician at a coal mine until it was shuttered a year ago. He applied unsuccessfully for maintenance and repair jobs, and got a job in manufacturing after enrolling in a program to learn how to operate computerized tools.   jobs weren’t an option, he said. “I couldn’t afford to go back to school,” he said. “And I’m used to working with my hands. ” If more men do   jobs, they could erase the stigma and turn them into men’s jobs, said Janette Dill, a sociologist at the University of Akron, at least for jobs that require less   caregiving. “More men will go into care because they don’t have a choice, but they’re going to carve out spaces for themselves that feel less like women’s work,” she said. Ms. Dill was a   of a study published in April that looked at what happens when men move into   jobs in the health care field. Men in the   health jobs, like the nursing assistants who change patients’ sheets and help them bathe, earned 10 percent less than men in   jobs. But they were less likely to be laid off and their wages rose over time, while   wages were stagnant. Technical health care jobs like ultrasound technician  —   requiring more training but not a college degree  —   paid 22 percent more than other   jobs, after controlling for things like education. They involve less interaction with patients and more with computers, so they are less stereotypically feminine. There is an education and race divide among the men who take these jobs, the study found. Black men were 3. 3 times as likely as white men to take the   health jobs, and other minority men were 1. 8 times as likely. White men were more likely to take the   technical jobs. For men without college degrees, more technical training that equips them for those jobs could help. And if health aide jobs paid more and offered better benefits, they’d probably attract more men. Some hospitals are trying to make caregiving jobs seem manly  —   like with a recruitment poster comparing the “adrenaline rush” of being an operating room nurse to mountain climbing. Perhaps then men could take the same pride in their work that Mr. Dawson, the unemployed welder, showed when he talked about making pilings for the rebuilt World Trade Center. “I had a good life as a welder,” he said. “It always amused me. That’s one reason I picked the job. ”"
Apple Removes New York Times Apps From Its Store in China - The New York Times,New York Times,Katie Benner and Sui-Lee Wee,2017-01-05,"Apple, complying with what it said was a request from Chinese authorities, removed news apps created by The New York Times from its app store in China late last month. The move limits access to one of the few remaining channels for readers in mainland China to read The Times without resorting to special software. The government began blocking The Times’s websites in 2012, after a series of articles on the wealth amassed by the family of Wen Jiabao, who was then prime minister, but it had struggled in recent months to prevent readers from using the   app. Apple removed both the   and   apps from the app store in China on Dec. 23. Apps from other international publications, including The Financial Times and The Wall Street Journal, were still available in the app store. “For some time now the New York Times app has not been permitted to display content to most users in China and we have been informed that the app is in violation of local regulations,” Fred Sainz, an Apple spokesman, said of the Times apps. “As a result, the app must be taken down off the China App Store. When this situation changes, the App Store will once again offer the New York Times app for download in China. ” Mr. Sainz declined to comment on what local regulations the Times apps were said to have violated, who had contacted Apple and when, and whether a court order or other legal document had been presented. China’s main internet regulator, the Cyberspace Administration of China, did not respond to faxed questions. The Times bureau in Beijing said it had not been contacted by the Chinese government about the matter. A Times spokeswoman in New York, Eileen Murphy, said the company had asked Apple to reconsider its decision. “The request by the Chinese authorities to remove our apps is part of their wider attempt to prevent readers in China from accessing independent news coverage by The New York Times of that country, coverage which is no different from the journalism we do about every other country in the world,” Ms. Murphy said in a statement. The request appears to have been made under regulations released in June 2016 called Provisions on the Administration of Mobile Internet Application Information Services. The regulations say apps cannot “engage in activities prohibited by laws and regulations such as endangering national security, disrupting social order and violating the legitimate rights and interests of others. ” The cyberspace administration says on its website that apps also cannot publish “prohibited” information. The ruling Communist Party tightly controls media inside China and employs one of the world’s most sophisticated systems of internet censorship. Chinese law prohibits the publication of “harmful information” online, and officials often take action without legal procedures or court orders against material they deem objectionable. Apple has previously removed other, less prominent media apps from its China store. It is unclear how the company evaluates requests from Beijing to take down apps and whether it ever resists them. Apple’s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, has said that the company complies with all local laws. While in early 2016 Apple resisted a court request in the United States for it to help federal officials unlock an iPhone for a criminal investigation, Mr. Cook said he would obey whatever order the court ultimately handed down. In the end, the government was able to unlock the device without Apple’’s help and the case was dropped. Farzana Aslam, associate director of the Center for Comparative and Public Law at the University of Hong Kong, noted that in matters involving customer privacy, Apple requires governments to submit subpoenas, search warrants or other legal documents. “Maybe in the end they have to do it, but I think there’s something to be said about standing up for what you believe in and purporting to put principle before profit in a country like China, to show that actually there is this tension there,” Ms. Aslam said. “It’s not as simple as, ‘Because we operate in your jurisdiction, we’ll do anything you ask of us. ’” She added that it was “very worrying” that Apple had not disclosed what laws the authorities said were violated, making it difficult for The Times and other publishers to file an appeal or challenge the government’s requests. In the weeks leading up to the withdrawal of the Times apps, The Times was working on various articles related to the Chinese government. One of them, posted online on Dec. 29, revealed the billions of dollars in hidden perks and subsidies that the Chinese government provides to the world’s biggest iPhone factory. China is also one of Apple’s largest iPhone markets, though sales in that region have slowed. On Dec. 23, David Barboza, a Times reporter, spoke with members of Apple’s media team about the article. Mr. Barboza had previously been in touch with the iPhone factory owner, Foxconn. He had also contacted the Chinese government as part of his reporting. Later that day, a separate team from Apple informed The Times that the apps would be removed, Ms. Murphy said. In another article, published on Dec. 22 as a post on its Sinosphere blog, The Times described an   internet video that had been widely promoted by Chinese public security offices. The Times news apps remain available in Apple’s app stores for other countries, as well as the Hong Kong and Taiwan stores, but people must have a credit card with a billing address outside mainland China to download them. The Times crossword puzzle and virtual reality apps remain available throughout China. When the Chinese government began blocking the Times websites in 2012, it also prevented users with Times apps from downloading new content. But readers in China can still gain access to The Times using software that circumvents the government’s firewall. And in July 2015, The Times released a new version of its   app that adopted a different method for retrieving articles, one that the government appeared unable to stop. Apple’s decision to remove the app from its China store should not affect those who have already installed it. But users in China will not be able to download new releases unless they use another region’s app store. The Times discovered after being blocked in 2012 that hackers with possible ties to the Chinese military had targeted the newspaper’s computer systems and that the attacks coincided with the reporting for that Times investigation. Foreign tech companies face increasing pressure from government authorities in China. In April, Apple’s iBooks Store and iTunes Movies were shut down in the country, just six months after they were introduced there. Mark Natkin, the   managing director of Marbridge Consulting, who advises American technology firms in China, said he did not think any such company entering the Chinese market could “ever fully comprehend how challenging it’s going to be. ” Mr. Natkin said that Apple had a certain amount of leverage against the Chinese government in terms of the total amount of jobs created but that “the technology gap has started to close. ”"
"Fed Officials See Faster Economic Growth Under Trump, but No Boom - The New York Times",New York Times,Binyamin Appelbaum,2017-01-05,"WASHINGTON  —   Federal Reserve officials expect Donald J. Trump’s election to result in somewhat faster economic growth over the next several years, but they see little chance of the boom Mr. Trump has promised, according to an account of the Fed’s most recent meeting in  . That is in part because the Fed plans to raise interest rates more quickly if growth accelerates. For now, however, Fed officials plan to wait and see what happens next, the account said. “While the Fed signaled that it would likely respond to expansionary fiscal policies with a faster pace of rate hikes, the Fed believes it is too early to embed this into its baseline,” Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays, wrote on Wednesday following the release of the minutes. “Any real shift in the stance of monetary policy will require more clarity on the stance of fiscal policy. ” At the December meeting, the Fed raised its benchmark rate for just the second time since 2008, citing the continued expansion of the economy and the steady decline of unemployment. The Fed debated and delayed that increase for most of last year, but the account published on Wednesday  —   after a standard   delay  —   described the final decision as uncontroversial. Officials instead spent the meeting talking about what comes next. Mr. Trump has promised a bevy of major changes in economic policy, including tax cuts and spending increases, reductions in regulation, and restrictions on trade and immigration. As a result, the account said, Fed officials regard both faster growth and slower growth as more likely than before the election, when the economy seemed locked into its longstanding pattern of slow and steady growth. “The job of conducting U. S. monetary policy has not become any easier over recent months,” said James Marple, senior economist at TD Bank, referring to the increased uncertainty. The Fed, led by Janet L. Yellen, the chairwoman, predicted in December that it would raise rates three times this year. The account said officials were not yet ready to predict how the pace of rate increases might change as a result of new policies pursued by Mr. Trump and Congress. “Participants emphasized their uncertainty about the timing, size and composition of any future fiscal and other economic policy initiatives as well as about how those policies might affect aggregate demand and supply,” the minutes said. The Fed’s   committee, the Federal Open Market Committee, has 17 members, 10 of whom cast votes on monetary policy. The Fed’s caution amounts to a bias in favor of growth. The economy is expanding at roughly the pace Fed officials regard as sustainable. The work force is growing slowly as more baby boomers retire, and productivity is rising slowly. Two percent growth may be about as good as it gets. Ms. Yellen has warned that fiscal stimulus, like a tax cut or a spending increase, could increase economic growth to an unsustainable pace in the near term, resulting in increased inflation. The Fed quite likely would seek to offset such policies by raising interest rates more quickly. Instead of acting   the Fed is choosing to wait for more information. But the minutes said officials were concerned about the challenge of communicating their increased uncertainty. They want to be clear that the Fed’s prediction about the pace of rate increases depends on its prediction about economic growth. Faster growth will mean faster increases. The account said Fed officials were confident in their ability to raise rates quickly enough to prevent overheating, seeing “only a modest risk” of a “sharp acceleration in prices. ” By holding rates at low levels, the Fed has sought to increase economic growth by encouraging borrowing and   higher rates reduce the stimulative effect. The benchmark rate now sits in a range from 0. 5 percent to 0. 75 percent, still very low by historical standards. “Consumers have no reason to panic about the rate hike last month, or even about additional rate increases in 2017,” said Alan MacEachin, chief corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union. He noted that the last rate hike would add $1 to the monthly payment on a $5, 000 credit card balance. The economic forecast prepared by the Fed’s staff for the December meeting anticipated that Mr. Trump’s election would result in “slightly higher” growth over the next several years. It said a likely increase in fiscal stimulus would be “substantially counterbalanced” by higher interest rates and a stronger dollar, which would reduce exports of American goods and services. Several Fed officials reported that Mr. Trump’s election had increased optimism among business executives in their districts. “Some contacts thought that their businesses could benefit from possible changes in federal spending, tax and regulatory policies,” the minutes said. The minutes also noted, however, that some executives were concerned about the negative impact of proposed policy changes. In a recent interview, John Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said many executives in his district, which encompasses the western United States, worried about the potential impact of restrictions on immigration and on foreign trade, both of which have been important drivers of regional growth. Businesses across the country also reported increased difficulty in hiring qualified workers, the minutes said. The unemployment rate fell to just 4. 6 percent in November. The lack of readily available workers could further limit the benefits of a fiscal stimulus."
"Rockefeller Foundation Picks Rajiv J. Shah, a Trustee, as President - The New York Times",New York Times,David Gelles,2017-01-10,"Rajiv J. Shah, a trustee of the Rockefeller Foundation, was asked about six months ago to join the committee that would select the foundation’s next president. He said no. Instead, Mr. Shah, who until recently had been the administrator of the United States Agency for International Development, ultimately said he wanted to be considered for the post. He got the job. On Thursday, the Rockefeller Foundation, one of the country’s largest and most influential philanthropies, will name Mr. Shah to succeed Judith Rodin, who has been president for 12 years. The appointment will make Mr. Shah one of the most powerful forces in charitable giving, overseeing a foundation that donates roughly $200 million each year and corrals governments, companies and organizations to contribute money and resources in tandem. Mr. Shah, 43, will be the first   to lead the Rockefeller Foundation, which has gained stature in recent years through some prominent projects but has sometimes been criticized as being more interested in its publicity than its grantees. Founded in 1913 by the oil tycoon John D. Rockefeller, the foundation says it has given away the equivalent of more than $17 billion in today’s dollars. Its first grant was to the American Red Cross, and it went on to play pivotal roles in establishing the field of public health, creating vaccines for yellow fever and malaria, and bringing agricultural advances to the developing world. In recent years, the foundation has focused on the themes of “resilience” and “inclusive economies. ” That has resulted in programs aimed at establishing “resilience officers” in 100 cities to focus on disaster relief and a plan that is sending 100, 000   students to see the musical “Hamilton. ” These efforts have struck critics as public relations stunts more than meaningful agents of change. And Ms. Rodin has drawn fire for spending too much time with corporate partners and not enough time with the recipients of grants. Much of the foundation’s work concerns improving health and   in Africa, aiding economic development in impoverished areas and developing strategies to combat climate change. It was these diverse causes that attracted Mr. Shah to the job. With advanced degrees in medicine and health finance from the University of Pennsylvania, Mr. Shah worked at the Bill  Melinda Gates Foundation for nearly a decade, rising to be director for agricultural development. From 2009 to 2015, he ran U. S. A. I. D. leading the response to disasters including the 2010 earthquake in Haiti and the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa. After leaving the agency, he founded Latitude Capital, a private equity firm focused on emerging markets. In those roles, Mr. Shah said, he came to understand the power of   partnerships, a strategy that Ms. Rodin has embraced at the Rockefeller Foundation. “I’ve seen what’s possible when people come together,” he said in an interview this week. “We were able to save tens of thousands, if not millions, of lives. ” Ms. Rodin was not involved in the search for her successor but has known Mr. Shah for years. They worked together on an agricultural project when he was at the Gates Foundation, and he joined the Rockefeller Foundation board in 2015. “He’s a marvel,” Ms. Rodin said in an interview this week. “He’s very strategic and very innovative. He shows an interpersonal dexterity that is well beyond his years. ” Ms. Rodin said she believed that Mr. Shah was a good fit for the job thanks in part to his time at U. S. A. I. D. which required that he forge alliances with a vast array of governments, organizations and companies. “One of the things we tried to emphasize during my time at Rockefeller was broadening the scope of partnerships,” Ms. Rodin said. “We see in Raj someone who has the capacity to take advantage of this, and has the capacity to be a great partner. ” Richard Parsons, the chairman of the Rockefeller Foundation board, said Mr. Shah was the unanimous choice of the search committee after a competitive process that considered hundreds of candidates. “Raj is the perfect guy to come in after her,” Mr. Parsons said in an interview. “He’s a performer. You put him up in front of a group and people come away impressed. Now, he’s got a platform. ” Mr. Shah said he was committed to the broad themes of resilience and inclusive economies. “That core concept of resilience is extraordinarily important going forward,” he said. “It gives us the opportunity to evolve into the future. ” But he said he would look for opportunities to address schisms in the American electorate in this divisive political moment. “It is a different time today than it was 10 or 15 years ago,” he said. “We live in a more fractured world. ” The Rockefeller Foundation is viewed by some has having a liberal bent. During Ms. Rodin’s tenure, the foundation donated money to the Clinton Foundation. Mr. Shah is close with President Obama but said he maintained good relations with Republicans in the House and Senate and believed that the foundation’s core mission had bipartisan appeal. “It’s widely acknowledged that tackling hunger and ensuring health around the globe are in our own national interest,” Mr. Shah said. “I have always been passionate about delivering social justice results at a massive scale. ” He will now have a $200 million a year to try to deliver those results."
"Philippines Jailbreak Frees More Than 150 Inmates, Prompting Manhunt - The New York Times",New York Times,Felipe Villamor,2017-01-05,"MANILA  —   A manhunt was underway Wednesday for more than 150 inmates who escaped from a jail in the southern Philippines after it came under attack by gunmen overnight. One guard was killed and another wounded in the assault on a jail in Kidapawan City on the   southern island of Mindanao, according to Peter Bungat, the warden. The gunmen were thought to be from a bandit group that had broken away from a Muslim rebel organization, Mr. Bungat told a radio station on Mindanao, which is home to a   insurgency. Five of the 158 inmates who escaped from the facility, the North Cotabato District Jail, were later killed in a shootout with pursuing officers, Senior Inspector Xavier Solda, a spokesman for the Philippine Bureau of Jail Management and Penology, told a radio station in Manila. A village official was also killed when he was mistaken for one of the escaped inmates, the police said. Mr. Bungat said the attack began early Wednesday, when the jail’s power supply was cut. Armed men then approached from behind the compound and began firing. “It was well planned,” Mr. Bungat said. He said it was unclear whether any “high profile” inmates were among the escapees. At least a dozen were involved in drug trafficking, according to officials from the jail management bureau. Mr. Bungat said the assault was believed to have been led by a bandit known as Commander Derbie, who once led a faction of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, the Philippines’ largest rebel group. Commander Derbie is widely believed to have broken away from that organization, which has signed a peace deal with the government. Philippine security officials have said that Commander Derbie joined a breakaway group called the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters. A spokesman for that group, Abu Misry, denied any involvement in the jailbreak. Ernesto Abella, a spokesman for President Rodrigo Duterte, said there was no “specific information” as to the identities of the gunmen, “though speculation is rife. ” Three inmates who had been charged with possessing drugs and explosives escaped from the North Cotabato District Jail last August. Eight years ago, three inmates accused of carrying out a bombing also escaped from the jail."
"Enough With the Tweets, China’s State Media Tells Trump - The New York Times",New York Times,Chris Buckley,2017-01-05,"BEIJING  —   China’s leaders thought they had a solution to the torrent of snark, jibes and condemnation on Twitter: They banned access to it at home. Yet China has become the country that   Donald J. Trump seems to enjoy criticizing the most on his    Twitter feed. In bursts of 140 characters or less, he has jabbed at Beijing over Taiwan, trade, the South China Sea and, most recently, North Korea. “China has been taking out massive amounts of money  wealth from the U. S. in totally   trade, but won’t help with North Korea. Nice!” Mr. Trump said on Twitter on Monday. How and when President Xi Jinping reads about these broadsides remains a mystery to outsiders. Translating Mr. Trump’s sarcasm  —   “Nice!”  —   could be tricky. But Chinese officials and the state news media want Mr. Trump to know that their leaders prefer doing diplomacy the   way, behind closed doors and muffled in platitudes. Xinhua, the state news agency, has more or less asked Mr. Trump to shut up. “An obsession with ‘Twitter foreign policy’ is undesirable,” read the headline of  a Xinhua commentary on Tuesday about Mr. Trump’s posts. “Everyone recognizes the common sense that foreign policy isn’t child’s play, and even less is it like doing business deals,” said the article, published after Mr. Trump’s latest barbed comments on China. “Twitter shouldn’t become an instrument of foreign policy,” the article said. Earlier that day, a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs rejected Mr. Trump’s accusation that Beijing had coddled North Korea. But the article acknowledged that it was probably too late to detach Mr. Trump from Twitter. Mr. Trump’s designated press secretary, Sean Spicer, has indicated that Mr. Trump will keep using the terse, punchy format after he settles in the White House. “Issuing tweets has become a habit for Mr. Trump,” Xinhua noted. Mr. Trump, it said, appeared to assume that “issuing   comments and taking up sensitive issues may perhaps add to his chips for negotiating with other countries. ” Mr. Xi is most unlikely to joust directly with Mr. Trump on Twitter. The service has been banned in China since 2009, though residents find ways to poke through the firewall of censorship. And while Chinese politicians love slogans, they prefer to communicate with foreign leaders through long, tranquilizing disquisitions. Open sarcasm is rare. Sad!"
Coming to Carnival Cruises: A Wearable Medallion That Records Your Every Whim - The New York Times,New York Times,Brooks Barnes,2017-01-04,"DORAL, Fla.  —   Inside a clandestine Carnival Corporation complex here, two former Disney executives have been plotting a drastic cruise industry overhaul. Their mission: Take lessons learned at Walt Disney World, where they helped bring about a $1 billion vacation management system involving   bracelets that link to personal information, and apply them to cruises. The result: Millions of passengers on Carnival ships will soon be using a similar but more advanced system that allows travelers to do everything from plan vacations to open stateroom doors to order poolside cocktails. “As long as bigger, newer, cooler ships have kept coming, the cruise industry has treated guest liabilities  —   standing in long lines, having a frustrating embarkation experience  —   as acceptable,” said John Padgett, who joined Carnival in 2014 as chief experience and innovation officer after 18 years at Disney. “That thinking stops now. ” Carnival, which operates more than 100 ships worldwide under 10 brands, will unveil its ambitious technology initiative on Thursday at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. In a keynote speech, Arnold W. Donald, Carnival’s chief executive, intends to announce that the system  —   an app called Ocean Compass paired with a     smart medallion that can be carried in a pocket or worn as jewelry  —   will arrive on the company’s Princess Cruises fleet this year. Mr. Donald declined in an interview to give a timeline for bringing the technology (code name: Trident) to other Carnival brands. But he emphasized that rolling out the personalized disks and app was a companywide priority. “The cost is in the hundreds of millions of dollars, and, over time, more than that,” Mr. Donald said. “People want the world to be organized around them. On vacation, even more so. ” Analysts expect the technology to increase profits in multiple ways, including allowing Carnival to charge more for tickets, particularly on older ships. Ease of purchase is another big component  —   cruisers will be able to pay for food, drinks and merchandise simply by having their credit   Ocean Medallion in their pocket. Carnival’s disks, each   with the guest’s name, will also power a new, shipwide gambling platform. And Carnival gift shops will be stocked with a wide array of jewelry, clips and key chains that passengers can buy to carry and display their disks. Carnival’s top rival, Royal Caribbean Cruises, already offers smartbands on   ships like the Anthem of the Seas. Called WOW bands, they serve as room keys, allow for wireless payment and make it faster and easier to embark and disembark. But Carnival says that its offering takes such systems much further, in part because its technology is designed to be invisible. Unlike with smartbands, there is no need to tap a sensor on a stateroom door for entry simply approaching the correct room with the Ocean Medallion in your pocket will unlock the door. Among the medallion system’s other offerings is a navigation tool designed to help family members find one another on the   ships. Under Mr. Donald, who took over Carnival in   after a string of ship debacles, the company has boomed. In the most recent quarter, Carnival had a record $1. 4 billion in net income, a 17 percent increase from the same period a year earlier. But he remains under pressure to recruit new customers. About 24. 2 million people worldwide took a cruise in 2016, according to the Cruise Lines International Association. That sounds like a lot, but “cruise vacations only represent about 2 percent of all vacations,” said David Beckel, an analyst at Bernstein Research. “Because there is such a low penetration rate, any increase in penetration  —   even a minor, minor one  —   represents a big difference, and hence the effort to improve the customer experience,” Mr. Beckel said. As part of its Ocean Medallion plan, Carnival has turned to television, paying to produce three travel shows designed to make cruising look fun and easy. The shows has been broadcast on weekends in recent months on ABC, NBC and the CW. In one   episode of “The Voyager with Josh Garcia,” the host is seen chatting with artists in Puerto Rico about making masks from coconuts. Carnival plans to produce at least 80 episodes in total. Analysts have praised the effort. “People have a lot of preconceived notions about cruising that largely aren’t true,” said Robin M. Farley, an analyst for UBS. The system that Carnival plans to introduce on Thursday still has a lot to prove. The technology will require the mass retraining of employees and substantial retrofitting of ships, including the installation of roughly 7, 000 sensors per boat. And do passengers really want to sacrifice privacy for personalization? One feature will allow guests to watch live entertainment in ship lounges on their stateroom televisions  —   and the performers will know who is watching and will be trained to do  . (“Hello to Brooks, tuning in from his bed on the Promenade Deck! ”) Mr. Padgett acknowledged that some guests will have “creepiness factor” questions. But he expects the vast majority to participate. “As long as you benefit the guest, they don’t mind sharing” personal information, he said. Using the connected app, guests can order food to be delivered wherever they plan to be at a designated time. (Waiters will know who you are because your photograph will pop up on an   device when they get close to your medallion.) By loading preferences into the app while still at home, Carnival will be able to offer tailored lists of activities. “The goal of preplanning is learning more about our guests,” said Michael G. Jungen, who joined Carnival in 2015 as vice president for design and technology after 15 years at Disney. He noted that passengers would have the option of linking their medallions with social media accounts, allowing Carnival to delve even deeper. As Carnival designed the Ocean Medallion system inside an unmarked building here in suburban Miami, it built a replica set of staterooms, corridors and other ship facilities to test concepts. Scribbles on a monumental white board in one area contained algorithms and personalization ideas. (“What time you eat dinner. What channels you watch. ”) When they were leading Disney’s technology effort in 2013, Mr. Padgett and Mr. Jungen built a similar laboratory, experimenting with ideas that ultimately became MyMagic+ the theme park wristband system that serves as wallet, room key, admission ticket, photograph collector and   pass. As he gave a reporter a tour of the Carnival site, Mr. Padgett continually returned to the topic of Disney  —   how the cost of cruising compares with a family trip to Disney World, and how Disney frames vacations as overarching stories. “The ultimate goal here,” he said, turning to a   Disney phrase, “is to delight and surprise our guests. ”"
2 Credit-Reporting Agencies Must Pay $23 Million for Deceptive Practices - The New York Times,New York Times,Reuters,2017-01-03,"The nation’s consumer watchdog agency on Tuesday ordered the   agencies TransUnion and Equifax to pay more than $23. 2 million in fines and restitution for deceiving customers about the usefulness of credit scores and the cost of obtaining them. The watchdog agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, said the payments would resolve charges that TransUnion and Equifax had lured consumers into enrolling in credit services advertised as free or costing only $1, but which could cost more than $200 a year. TransUnion will reimburse $13. 93 million to consumers and pay a $3 million civil fine, while Equifax will reimburse $3. 8 million and pay a $2. 5 million civil fine, the bureau said. Both companies will also modify their marketing practices. Among the changes, they will obtain customers’ consent to enroll them in services in which fees begin after free trials and make it easier for them to cancel services they do not want. The bureau said the wrongful conduct had violated the     law and had occurred at TransUnion since July 2011 and at Equifax between July 2011 and March 2014. Many lenders rely on credit scores from TransUnion, Equifax and their rival Experian when lending money. But TransUnion and Equifax falsely represented the credit scores they sold to consumers as being the same scores that lenders used, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said. “Credit scores are central to a consumer’s financial life, and people deserve honest and accurate information about them,” Richard Cordray, the bureau’s director, said in a statement. Neither TransUnion, which is based in Chicago, nor Equifax, which is based in Atlanta, admitted or denied wrongdoing. A TransUnion spokesman, David Blumberg, and an Equifax spokeswoman, Ines Gutzmer, said their companies believed that they had complied with the law and were committed to better educating consumers about their credit. Experian was not charged. A spokesman for the bureau did not immediately have additional comment. In 2015, under a separate settlement with 31 state attorneys general, the   agencies agreed to improve how they fixed mistakes and addressed disputes."
"Coal Fire, Not Just Iceberg, Doomed the Titanic, a Journalist Claims - The New York Times",New York Times,Dan Bilefsky,2017-01-04,"LONDON  —   Maybe it wasn’t just the iceberg. Ever since the Titanic sank more than 104 years ago, killing more than 1, 500 men, women and children, mystery has swirled around the tragedy. No one doubts that the ship collided at high speed with an iceberg off the coast of Newfoundland. But a new documentary posits that the sinking of the ship  —   hailed at the time as the largest ever built, and praised for its professed unsinkability  —   may have been accelerated by a giant coal fire in its hull that appeared to have started as long as three weeks before it set off on its fateful journey to New York from Southampton, England. In the documentary, which was broadcast on Channel 4 in Britain on New Year’s Day, Senan Molony, an Irish journalist who has spent more than 30 years researching the Titanic, contends that the fire, in a    bunker next to one of the ship’s boiler rooms, damaged its hull, helping to seal its fate long before it slammed into the iceberg. “It’s a perfect storm of extraordinary factors coming together: fire, ice and criminal negligence,” he argues in the documentary, “Titanic: The New Evidence,” which will air in the United States on the Smithsonian Channel on January 21. “The fire was known about, but it was played down. She should never have been put to sea. ” Mr. Molony’s potential breakthrough can be traced to an attic in Wiltshire, in southwest England, where a previously unpublished album of photographs chronicling the ship’s construction and the preparations for its maiden voyage had been gathering dust for more than a century. The photographs were discovered by a descendant of a director of the   company, Harland and Wolff, that built the Titanic. About four years ago, a collaborator of Mr. Molony’s acquired the rare photographs of the ship, meticulously taken by Harland and Wolff’s engineering chief before it left a Belfast shipyard. When the two men looked closely at the images, Mr. Molony said, they were shocked to discover a    diagonal black mark on the hull’s front starboard side, close to where the ship was pierced by the iceberg. An analysis by engineers at Imperial College London subsequently revealed that the mark was most likely caused by a fire in a coal bunker of the ship. Mr. Molony called the photographs “the Titanic equivalent of Tutankhamen’s tomb,” because of the richness of historical detail they conveyed, including the mark highlighting the extent of the damage. Experts said the theory was compelling but were divided over how important a role the fire may have played. In an interview, Richard de Kerbrech, a marine engineer based on the Isle of Wight who has written two books on the Titanic disaster, said that the fire would have damaged the ship’s bulkhead, a wall of steel within the ship’s hull, and made it more vulnerable after it was pierced by an iceberg. An official British inquiry, in 1912, mentioned the fire, but the judge who presided over it, whom critics saw as sympathetic to shipping interests, played it down. “This discovery is a revelation and could change our knowledge of the history of what happened,” Mr. de Kerbrech said. Mr. Molony contends that the ship’s owners knew about the fire but chose to let it go, since delaying the ship’s journey would have been financially ruinous. At the time of departure, the ship was berthed so that the marks caused by the fire were facing the sea, away from the dock, and therefore concealed from passengers. The Titanic disaster has long fanned conspiracy theories, among them that it was not the Titanic that sank on April 15, 1912, but, rather the Olympic, its sister ship that the Titanic was torpedoed by a German   or that the ship was brought down by a sarcophagus containing an Egyptian priestess’s mummy. Popularized by Hollywood, the story of the Titanic continues to exert a hold on popular culture. Construction of a   replica recently began at a theme park in China. Mr. Molony said his fascination took root when he was 12 and was gripped by “A Night to Remember,” Walter Lord’s 1955 book recounting the Titanic’s final night. He said he was so captivated that he finished the book in two hours and 40 minutes, the same time it took the Titanic to sink. Now the political editor at The Irish Daily Mail, Mr. Molony, who has also written a book called “The Irish Aboard Titanic,” was also drawn to the social divisions reflected on the ship, where   cabins hosted millionaires while hundreds of   passengers, many of them Irish, stayed below. Mr. Molony said he believed the fire had been played down, in part because death by iceberg was a more dramatic explanation. “The ship was seen as a heroic unsinkable ship and, as a result, people focused on explanations that fed that narrative,” he said. Not everyone is convinced. David Hill, a former honorary secretary of the British Titanic Society, who has been studying the cause of the sinking since the 1950s, argued that, while the damage caused by the fire to the steel walls protecting the hull may have hastened the disaster, the blaze was not the decisive factor. “When the Titanic hit the iceberg close to midnight on April 14, 1912, it created a    line of damage on the starboard section of the hull, including punctures and gashes, that opened up too many compartments to the sea, so that the weight of the water dragged the bow down so low that the ship eventually sank,” he said. “A fire may have accelerated this. But in my view, the Titanic would have sunk anyways. ” He added: “It amazes me how this ship still captures the global imagination. It was not the   catastrophe at sea. But it is the one everyone remembers. ”"
Chase Sapphire Reserve Card’s Huge Bonus Will Be Slashed - The New York Times,New York Times,Ron Lieber,2017-01-23,"When a Wall Street banking institution starts throwing   bonuses at credit card customers, it may be best to grab them before they inevitably disappear. And so it goes with Chase Sapphire Reserve, a card that the bank, JPMorgan Chase, introduced last summer. The bank offered a   bonus worth $1, 500 to people who spent $4, 000 on the card in the first three months they had it and then redeemed the bonus for travel. Now the bank is cutting the bonus in half. Jan. 12 will be the last day that people can earn it by applying for the card online, though people who apply at a bank branch will still be able to get the bonus until March 12. You need not be a current bank customer to apply at a branch, according to a bank spokeswoman, Ashley E. Dodd, who confirmed the changes. The bonus played a big role in bringing the card so much attention, landing it on the cover of Bloomberg Businessweek and leading the bank to hand out so many perks that it caused a $200 million to $300 million hit to its earnings. Even without the outsize bonus, which was very rare in the history of credit card bonus offers, the card is likely to remain popular. While it has a steep $450 annual fee, cardholders receive a $300 credit each year for any travel spending they put on the card. And customers earn three points for every dollar they spend on all travel and dining, which can lead to better value than the rewards that most other cards offer for customers who spent a lot in those areas. The Points Guy blog first reported the slashing of the   bonus. Many such sites now exist to help consumers take advantage of the most lucrative   offers, while collecting commissions when they pass readers on to card issuers’ application sites. If those customers keep the cards for a few years (and especially if they run up balances and pay interest) the banks can come out ahead. With too many people gaming the offer, however, bank profitability can suffer, especially when the   bonuses are so large that they attract hordes of   consumers."
Broadway Breaks Multiple Records Through New Year’s Weekend - The New York Times,New York Times,Michael Paulson,2017-01-05,"Broadway rang out 2016 with a very big bang. The 33 plays and musicals running last week brought in a whopping $49. 7 million, making it the   week in Broadway history. It was also the   week on record, with 359, 495 people seeing Broadway shows. All around Times Square, records were toppled like pins in a bowling alley: It was the best week ever for   shows like “Chicago,” “Jersey Boys” and “The Lion King” the most money ever grossed at multiple theaters built more than a century ago (for example, $911, 000 by “Oh, Hello” at the Lyceum, which was built in 1903) the most performances ever by a single show during a   period (17, by “The Illusionists”) and the most money ever grossed by a single show ($3. 3 million, by “Hamilton”). An astonishing 24 shows grossed more than $1 million last week, including seven that grossed more than $2 million, according to figures released Tuesday by the Broadway League. Three shows topped the $3 million mark: “Hamilton,” “Wicked” and “The Lion King. ” The grosses for the week ending Jan. 1 were 63 percent higher than the previous week, and 15 percent higher than the same week the previous year (even though there were five more shows playing at the same time last year). Why? The most significant factor appears to be pricing: The base prices for many Broadway shows are high, and the premium prices charged over the holiday period were even higher.   shows had an average price over $100. And for “Hamilton,” now the industry leader in pricing, the average price was $310, and the top price was $998. (That’s the price charged by the box office the first time a ticket was sold many people paid higher prices purchasing from resellers.) There were other factors contributing to the Broadway bonanza. New York City was wrapping up a banner year for tourism: an estimated 60. 3 million visitors, up from 58. 5 million the previous year, according to Christopher Heywood, a spokesman for NYC  Company, the city’s tourism agency. The period between Christmas and New Year’s is always popular for tourists  —   and lucrative for Broadway  —   but especially so this winter, because Christmas and New Year’s fell on weekends, and many people took off work the week in between. Multiple shows that aim heavily at tourists did extraordinarily well. For example: Cirque du Soleil’s first Broadway venture, “Paramour,” had its best week yet, at $1. 9 million, and “The Phantom of the Opera,” the   Broadway show and a reliable barometer for tourist traffic, had its best week too, also at $1. 9 million. Broadway took advantage of the expected high tourism last week by staging more performances. The usual Broadway schedule sees shows staged eight times a week, but last week 25 shows had nine performances. And then there was “The Illusionists,” a holiday season magic show, which managed to have 17 performances by scheduling shows three times a day Monday through Friday, and then twice on Sunday. Other factors: Broadway is on an upswing. Grosses and attendance have been growing for several years, and the current season has already featured strong starts for three new musicals: “Natasha, Pierre and the Great Comet of 1812,” “A Bronx Tale” and “Dear Evan Hansen. ” “The record just broken for both attendance and grosses for the last week reflects the continuing success of the range of theater being produced on Broadway,” said Charlotte St. Martin, the president of the Broadway League. Several shows that had announced closing dates had a surge of   patrons. “Matilda” closed on Sunday after its best week ($1. 9 million) and “Jersey Boys,” which closes on Jan. 15, set a record, too ($1. 8 million). Some plays benefited as well: “The Humans,” which won the Tony for best new play last year, grossed an impressive $815, 000 as it prepared to close on Jan. 15. Of course, the good news is not likely to last. January and February are generally soft months for Broadway. Thirteen shows are scheduled to close between Dec. 31 and Jan. 29, as theaters clear the decks for a round of openings in late winter and spring."
"Italian Inmates Sip, Smell and Taste Their Way to Rehabilitation - The New York Times",New York Times,Gaia Pianigiani,2017-01-25,"LECCE, Italy  —   One of his first students was a young man he had arrested four years earlier. Others have been convicted of armed robbery, drug trafficking and criminal association with the mafia. The classrooms are frugally equipped, behind windows protected by vertical and horizontal bars, although one has brightly colored paintings covering the walls. But none of that deterred Marco Albanese, a police officer for 19 years and a trained sommelier for five, from teaching a class of rapt students the finer points of deconstructing the bouquet of a chardonnay or pouring a rare vintage. Mr. Albanese, 43, is an instructor in an innovative effort at Lecce Penitentiary to teach inmates to be sommeliers, or wine stewards. The courses are part of a program to teach prisoners new professional skills, as well as to help them develop a bond with the region, which is renowned for its negroamaro grapes. The program has been enthusiastically embraced by the prisoner students, who were tasting white wines on a recent afternoon. It has also been an eye opener for Mr. Albanese. “I could see their human aspect, once they were out of their context,” Mr. Albanese, who traded in his police uniform for the crisp blue jacket and tie of a sommelier for the class. “And I didn’t have to keep the same distance, now that I was their ‘professor. ’” He added, “They also deserve a second chance, and it’s important that they know that the institutions do believe that they can be educated to a different life. ” In eight lessons, the group of 30 men and women, who are instructed in separate classes, learn how to taste, choose and serve local wines. “We hope to teach them the social value of work and the preciousness of their own territory, so that they can later choose to work here, already having the right skill set,” said Rita Russo, the director of Lecce Penitentiary, which is the largest in the region of Apulia. Inmates can also study for their high school diplomas, cultivate tomatoes, take theater classes and learn to be painters or tailors. Class begins with a slide show on the history of wine, explaining how it was drunk by the ancient Greeks and introducing the students to the Roman ancestors of modern sommeliers in Italy. On a school table, covered with a khaki tablecloth, stood wine glasses, ready for use. Three bottles of chardonnay, a red primitivo and a negroamaro stood on a table nearby. Mr. Albanese then addressed the prisoners, who sat facing him on stools listing the temperatures at which different wines should be served and how to store them in cellars. For a finale, he offered a   tip. “Do remember, even if you had Trump over for dinner, the pope would still be served first. The clergy does come first, even before heads of state,” he said, to raucous laughter. The prisoners, whose identity is being protected by the prison, were not allowed to be interviewed or photographed for this article. Roberto Giannone, who works for the local sommelier association, then demonstrated how to open a bottle, neatly slicing off the capsule covering the bottleneck in three cuts, inserting the corkscrew and smoothly pulling out the cork. “Once the cork is out,” he said, “use a napkin to show it to your customers. It’s an easy way to be polite and avoid objections. ” Since the 1970s, the Italian penal system has focused on   for inmates. However, a lack of funds for rehabilitation, as well as chronic overcrowding, means that thousands of incarcerated men and women have little to do all day. That has sparked some innovative rehabilitation programs, including a restaurant inside a   prison near Milan in which the waiters and cooks are inmates. But the sommelier class at the Lecce prison is believed to be unique in Italy. “Of course, sommelier courses can’t be considered a treatment,” said Georgia Zara, the head of a program at the University of Turin that offers a master’s degree in criminological and forensic psychology. “But they do educate inmates and create social interaction, which is very important. ” The classes also offer a “bridge between the jail context and the world outside, so it’s a small investment to reduce the risk of recidivism,” Ms. Zara said. Gianvito Rizzo, 53, is the chief executive at the Feudi di Guagnano, a local vintner that provides wine, like negroamaro, for the classes. He is also the creator of the sommelier classes at the prison. Mr. Rizzo has proposed that inmates start working on his nearly 75 acres of vines in the coming year under certain circumstances, some inmates in Italy are allowed to work outside prisons. “I see wine in a democratic way,” Mr. Rizzo said as he walked through his vineyard recently. “The countryside is the opposite to a cell. You are free. You smell nature, and learn to care for it. I think it’d be good also for inmates to try it out. ” Mr. Rizzo said that when he had received a master’s degree from the Bocconi University business school in Milan three decades ago, he had been “fixated” on doing something for his native region of Salento, in Apulia, on the heel of the Italian boot. He settled on going into the wine business, which had been struggling to convert farmers who cultivated for personal or local use into becoming larger producers. He now produces 16 different wines from grapes grown in vineyards that he and two friends and business partners inherited from their fathers, added to those that other friends asked them to cultivate on their behalf. He calls this collaborative effort his “first social experiment. ” When Mr. Rizzo heard about the penitentiary’s activities for prisoners, he proposed the sommelier classes to Ms. Russo. While it is unclear if any of the students will ever become professional sommeliers, the exposure to the world of wine provided by the classes has been very welcome. “I don’t even drink, but I’ve learned to sip it, smell it and taste it,” said one inmate, who is serving a   sentence and who was granted an exception to speak anonymously. “You can think it’s a small thing, but it means the world to us. ”"
"49ers Fire Coach Chip Kelly, GM Trent Baalke - Breitbart",Breitbart,AP,2017-01-02,"SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP)  —   The San Francisco 49ers fired coach Chip Kelly and general manager Trent Baalke on Sunday in the latest overhaul for a franchise that has fallen from perennial Super Bowl contender to the bottom of the standings in three seasons. [Team CEO Jed York announced the moves just hours after the Niners ( ) matched a franchise record for losses in a season by losing the finale to Seattle  .  “Despite my feelings for Trent and Chip, I felt the decision to change our football leadership was absolutely necessary,” York said in a statement. “The performance of this team has not lived up to my expectations or those of our fans, and that is truly disappointing. We all expected to see this team progress and develop as the season went on, but unfortunately that did not happen. That is why now is the time to find a new direction for this team. ” The team has been searching for success ever since cutting ties with Jim Harbaugh following an   record in 2014. Harbaugh had led San Francisco to three straight trips to the NFC title game and one Super Bowl appearance from   in the only stretch of success in the past 15 years for a franchise that has won five Super Bowls. Jim Tomsula was fired after going   in 2015 and things only got worse under Kelly, whose once bright coaching star has dimmed after being fired by Philadelphia and San Francisco the past two years. This marks the first time in nearly four decades that a team fired coaches in successive years after just   tenures. The only other time that happened since the 1970 merger came when San Francisco fired Monte Clark after the 1976 season and Ken Meyer the following year. The Niners then fired Pete McCulley midway through the 1978 season and interim coach Fred O’Connor after the year before hiring Bill Walsh to start a dynasty. “It’s frustrating we’re in this position again,” left tackle Joe Staley said before the news became official. “As a player you have to look at yourself first. What can I do next season to make sure we’re not in this position?” Kelly entered the NFL as one of the most highly sought coaches after his success in college at Oregon. After winning 10 games in each of his first two seasons in Philadelphia in   Kelly was fired with a   record for the Eagles late last season. He then lasted just one season with the Niners, raising more questions about whether his   spread offense that was so successful at Oregon can work in the NFL. He never had much of a chance at success with San Francisco with a roster that featured Blaine Gabbert and Colin Kaepernick as the top two quarterbacks and had no playmakers on the outside. “We don’t control the roster, so I think the one thing is our job as coaches is to create an environment where our players have an opportunity to be successful, and that’s what we have to do,” Kelly said before getting the news in a meeting with York. “I don’t look at, ‘I wish I had this. I wish I had that.’ We were fortunate for the guys we had and we tried to coach them as hard as we could and as well as we could. ” Baalke helped build the roster that made three straight trips to the NFC title game from   and one Super Bowl appearance. But the team has had declining win totals the past three seasons, including a record   losing streak this season. “While we experienced our share of success over the years, I am disappointed at where we are today,” Baalke said in a statement. The 49ers lost 13 straight games at one point this season and their only wins came against the Rams. San Francisco set franchise worsts for points, total yards and yards rushing allowed in a season and blew four   leads in eight home games. Now they will look for a fourth coach in four seasons. “When we lose like we did and have a season like we had, changes are made, or can be made,” receiver Torrey Smith said. “That’s from coaches to players. It’s all of us. We were all a part of the problem. That’s why our record is what it was. ” Baalke originally joined the Niners as a scout in 2005 and quickly worked his way up to director of player personnel where he helped   manager Scot McCloughan put together many of the pieces of the team that would be one of the most talented in the league. Baalke replaced McCloughan as the top front office executive shortly before the 2010 draft and came away from that with a load of talent led by Anthony Davis, Mike Iupati and NaVorro Bowman. Baalke was given the title of general manager the following year when the Niners hired Harbaugh as coach and Baalke had another successful draft that featured   pass rusher Aldon Smith and Kaepernick with his first two picks. The talent well went dry after that. Despite having 51 picks since 2012, Baalke has not added an impact player in any of those five drafts as he frequently drafted players with injuries and stayed away from skill position players. Since 2012, Baalke has had 15 picks in the first three rounds and used just one  —     running back Carlos Hyde in 2013  —   on a quarterback, receiver or running back."

L.A. #ResistMarch: The Day the Gay Rights Movement Ended - Breitbart,Breitbart,Joel B. Pollak,2017-06-12,"The conversion of the Los Angeles Gay Pride march into the   “#ResistMarch” on Sunday marked the effective end of the gay rights movement. [Once, the gay rights movement stood for tolerance: hence the rainbow flag, which is a symbol not only of pride but also of acceptance. But the message on Sunday was that lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) conservatives are unwelcome in that spectrum  —   and are, in fact, aiding the enemy.  The purpose of Gay Pride parades, in L. A. and elsewhere, has historically been to create an environment into which LGBTQ individuals could “come out of the closet” and express their sexuality without fear of persecution. But the complete transformation of the gay rights movement into a   political monolith has created an environment profoundly hostile to gay conservatives. The gay rights movement has destroyed one closet, only to build another. Aside from the totalitarian,   mentality of some of the movement’s leaders  —   which was on full display in the screeching speeches from the front of the march on Sunday  —   there are two other reasons for the gay rights movement’s transformation from a force for liberation into a tool for repression. One is that the movement has run out of great causes for which to fight. With the Supreme Court’s June 2015 discovery of a right to gay marriage in the U. S. Constitution, the gay rights movement has little left to achieve. It has poured energy and resources into the new cause of transgender rights, but that is a deeply complicated issue that affects a tiny percentage of Americans. The other reason the gay rights movement appears to have adopted a   political approach is that its leaders seem to think that they simply do not need Republican support. Although Americans, and Republicans in particular, have been increasingly tolerant toward the LGBTQ community  —   with Donald Trump specifically   the movement at the 2016 Republican National Convention  —   the gay rights movement has generally preferred to fight its cause in the courts rather than appealing to the goodwill of voters. That strategy has largely worked, and the lesson the movement and its leaders appear to have drawn is that they can dispense with Republicans as allies. But it is one thing to ignore Republicans, and quite another to declare war on them. The leaders of L. A. Pride made a conscious decision to turn their annual celebration into a Democratic Party rally, adopting the rhetoric of the   “Resistance. ” There was not even a perfunctory gesture at bipartisanship. The battle lines were sharply drawn, with even “our love, and our music, and our joy” denied to people who might vote for the opposing political party. The #ResistMarch willingly cast aside the idea of standing up for LGBTQ people of all political backgrounds. In so doing, it effectively declared the gay rights movement over. Gay Pride is no longer about pride: it is about the mobilization of popular culture for partisan purposes, with LGBTQ conservatives shoved behind the closet door. Joel B.

Rep. Barbara Lee: ‘I Don’t Agree with States’ Rights’ Because Trump Does - Breitbart,Breitbart,Penny Starr,2017-06-13,"Rep. Barbara Lee ( ) said on Tuesday that she does not agree with states’ rights because President Donald Trump believes in restoring states’ authority on a wide range of issues, including education and health care insurance markets. [Lee made the remarks at the   Center for American Progress in Washington, DC, where she referenced states rights as it applies to Trump’s decision this month to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate change agreement, a move she claims would hurt the U. S. economy.  Moreover, Lee said, California is still committed to fighting global warming. “Pulling out of the Paris Accord is also a job killer,” Lee said. “Because the energy sector  —   the green sector  —   coming from California we’re doing a lot of things  —   I think some other states will follow. “Because the jobs that are being created will be destroyed now as a result of what this president has done,” Lee said. “I don’t agree with states’ rights because that is kind of this administration’s push but in some instances when we have to just go at it on our own  —   we need to go at it on our own,” Lee said. But according to Robertson Williams, a professor at the University of Maryland and director of academic programs for Resources for the Future, a   group that studied the climate change agreement, it is difficult to know exactly what the economic impacts of withdrawing will be. Williams was interviewed by the Boston public radio station in May where he was asked about the economic impact of leaving the agreement. “One of the problems we have, we’re much better at modeling the cost of doing something to reduce emissions than we are modeling the cost of doing nothing,” Williams said. “We don’t know very well how other countries are gonna react. “If other countries react by doing less to fight climate change, that has very real costs,” Williams said. “That unchecked climate change could have very serious costs for the U. S. economy. “But knowing exactly how big that is is really hard,” Williams said."
17 Alleged Mexican Cartel Operatives Charged in Colorado,Breitbart,Ryan Saavedra,2017-04-21,"A federal grand jury returned an indictment charging 17 defendants for drug trafficking in direct connection with a Mexican drug cartel. [The arrests and indictments of the 17 defendants were the result of a   investigation into a Mexican drug cartel operation that smuggled narcotics into the United States from California to Colorado, according to a statement from the Department of Justice.  Jeff Dorschner, Spokesman for the Colorado U. S. Attorney’s Office, told Breitbart Texas, “During the course of this investigation law enforcement determined that a Mexican Cartel was involved. The identity of that cartel is not being released as it remains the subject of an ongoing criminal investigation. ” According to the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) the Sinaloa Mexican Drug Cartel is known to be the dominant drug cartel in both California and Colorado.  Of the 17 defendants, 11 are from Mexico, four from El Salvador, and two are from California. Seven of the defendants are considered fugitives. The defendants are alleged to have brought large quantities of cocaine and methamphetamine into the United States through California using secret compartments in vehicles. The drugs were kept in stash houses in Aurora, Colorado, before being distributed at a local grocery store. A money transfer station at the grocery store was used to send some of the proceeds back to Mexico. The rest of the funds were smuggled back in secret vehicle compartments. “We are committed to dismantling and removing the threat posed by these criminal organizations flooding American communities with dangerous narcotics,” said Attorney General Jeff Sessions. “This organization is alleged to have moved large amounts of meth and cocaine from Mexico to Colorado, with devastating impact on communities in their wake. I want to congratulate the outstanding federal, state, and local law enforcement cooperation that resulted in this highly successful operation. Replicating this kind of aggressive law enforcement take down is critical to breaking the backs of these criminal organizations. ” The Defendants from Mexico are: Jose   58, (naturalized) Selestino   45 Fredy   age unknown “Bancholas” age unknown, (thought to be from Mexico) Rodrigo   49, (naturalized) Oscar   age unknown Eduardo   37 “Changuito” age unknown, (thought to be from Mexico) “ ” age unknown, (thought to be from Mexico) Leopoldo   Age Unknown And Heberto   43. The Defendants from El Salvador are Lara   age unknown Claudia   41, (naturalized) Vilma L. Zamora, 67 and Jose   age unknown. The Defendants from California are Juan Carlos   31 and Erik Parra. The indictment contains 45 counts, including an asset forfeiture allegation against the stash houses that were used to hide the drugs.

Tillerson: Russia Must Choose Between Assad and the U.S. - Breitbart,Breitbart,Breitbart News,2017-04-11,"LUCCA, Italy (AP)  —   U. S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson issued an ultimatum to Russia on Tuesday: Side with the U. S. and likeminded countries on Syria, or embrace Iran, militant group Hezbollah and embattled Syrian leader Bashar Assad. [As he embarked on a trip to Moscow following urgent meetings in Italy with top diplomats, Tillerson said it was unclear whether Russia had failed to take seriously its obligation to rid Syria of chemical weapons, or had merely been incompetent. But he said the distinction “doesn’t much matter to the dead. ”  “We cannot let this happen again,” the secretary of state said. “We want to relieve the suffering of the Syrian people. Russia can be a part of that future and play an important role,” Tillerson added in remarks to reporters. “Or Russia can maintain its alliance with this group, which we believe is not going to serve Russia’s interests longer term. ” Since the U. S. launched airstrikes against Assad’s forces in retaliation for a chemical attack on civilians last week, Trump administration officials have offered mixed messages about whether Washington believes Assad definitely must surrender power  —   and when. Tillerson said it was clear the U. S. saw no role for Assad in Syria’s future, given that he had lost legitimacy. “It is clear to all of us that the reign of the Assad family is coming to an end,” he said. “But the question of how that ends and the transition itself could be very important in our view to the durability, the stability inside of a unified Syria. ” “That’s why we are not presupposing how that occurs,” Tillerson added. He said the   talks that Russia and Iran have helped broker in the Kazakh capital, Astana, could generate momentum toward broader talks about a political transition  —   if the Astana talks succeed in creating a durable  . The resulting political talks would take place under the auspices of the United Nations process in Geneva. “To date, Astana has not achieved much progress,” Tillerson said. Tillerson spoke after a meeting of the “likeminded” countries was hastily arranged on the sidelines of the summit of the Group of Seven industrialized economies in Italy, days after the U. S. for the first time launched airstrikes against Assad’s forces. A key focus since the chemical attack has been on increasing pressure on Russia, Assad’s strongest ally, which has used its own military to keep Assad in power. The U. S. and others have said that Russia bears responsibility for the deaths of civilians at the hands of Assad given Moscow’s role in guaranteeing the 2013 deal in which Assad was supposed to have given up his chemical weapons arsenal. The U. S. raised the stakes significantly on Monday when a senior U. S. official said Washington has made a preliminary conclusion that Russia knew in advance of Syria’s chemical weapons attack. Yet the U. S. has no proof of Moscow’s involvement, said the official, who wasn’t authorized to speak publicly on intelligence matters and demanded anonymity. That accusation will hang over Tillerson’s visit to Moscow, where he plans with meet with Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, and possibly with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Kremlin declined to say whether Putin would meet with Tillerson, in line with its usual practice of not announcing such meetings ahead of time. The United States has sought to minimize expectations for the trip or the likelihood that the U. S. will leave with any concessions from Russia regarding its support for Assad. Instead, the U. S. is hoping to use the visit  —   the first by a Trump Cabinet official to Russia  —   to convey its expectations to Moscow and then allow the Russians a period of time to respond. Though intended to punish Assad for a chemical weapons attack, the U. S. strikes last week served to refocus the world’s attention on the bloody war in Syria, now in its seventh year. Diplomats gathered in Italy as U. S. officials in Washington floated the possibility of new sanctions on the Syrian and Russian military, plus the threat of additional U. S. military action if Assad’s government continues attacking civilians. At Tuesday’s meeting in the walled Tuscan city of Lucca, the   countries were joined by diplomats from   nations including Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates. The inclusion of those countries is important because the U. S. strategy for Syria involves enlisting help from Mideast nations to ensure security and stability in Syria after the Islamic State group is vanquished."
Ivanka Trump to Head Review of U.S. Role in Paris Climate Change Agreement - Breitbart,Breitbart,Penny Starr,2017-05-07,"Ivanka Trump has been tapped by her father, President Donald Trump, to review the United States’ commitment to the Paris Climate Change agreement, signed by former President Barack Obama as an executive agreement in 2015 without congressional approval, the Associated Press is reporting. [The agreement requires countries to cut greenhouse emissions on a    basis, with Obama committing the U. S. to reduce carbon emissions by at least 26 percent below 2005 levels by 2025.  The U. S. is expected to have a representative at the United Nations’ climate change meeting in Bonn, Germany, next week but Trump’s advisers  —   including daughter Ivanka and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt  —   are meeting on Tuesday in Washington to decide whether to stick with or withdraw from the deal. Last month, in an interview with FOX and Friends, Pruitt said that the “Paris [agreement] is something that we need to really look at closely. It’s something we need to exit, in my opinion. It’s a bad deal for America. It was an America second, third, or fourth kind of approach. “China and India had no obligations under the agreement until 2030,” Pruitt added. “We   all of our costs. ” Trump, on the other hand, has expressed support for the agreement and has backing from some in the U. S. oil and gas industry, including Exxon Mobil, which was led by Rex Tillerson before he was nominated for Secretary of State, a post he now holds. “The industry campaign to stick with the Paris accord comes amid deep divisions in the Trump administration over the   agreement,” Bloomberg reported last month. “Both the president’s daughter, Ivanka Trump, and her husband, Jared Kushner, a White House special adviser, have urged the president to stay in the deal, along with Tillerson. ” “The decision to participate in next week’s U. N. climate talks shouldn’t be construed as a sign that Trump has decided to stay in the Paris pact,” a State Department official told the AP. “To the contrary, the U. S. will be sending a ‘much smaller’ delegation than it has in years past, the official said, adding that they weren’t authorized to discuss specifics and requested anonymity from the AP. According to the United Nations, 144 of the 197 countries that signed the Paris agreement have ratified it. It is unclear which 53 countries have not ratified it."

A facts page summarizing Gorsuch’s positions contains his full statement, which says the Supreme Court has held that “the Second Amendment protects an individual’s right to own firearms and may not be infringed lightly. ”  He also wrote that there is “a long tradition of widespread gun ownership by private individuals in this country. ” It is worth remembering that Trump pledged to nominate a justice “in the mold of Scalia,” and a SCOTUSblog entry for January 13, 2017, indicates he may have done just that. Here’s an excerpt from the the entry: The great compliment that Gorsuch’s legal writing is in a class with Scalia’s is deserved: Gorsuch’s opinions are exceptionally clear and routinely entertaining he is an unusual pleasure to read, and it is always plain exactly what he thinks and why. Like Scalia, Gorsuch also seems to have a set of   commitments apart from his personal policy preferences that drive his  . He is an ardent textualist (like Scalia) he believes criminal laws should be clear and interpreted in favor of defendants even if that hurts government prosecutions (like Scalia) he is skeptical of efforts to purge religious expression from public spaces (like Scalia) he is highly dubious of legislative history (like Scalia) and he is less than enamored of the dormant commerce clause (like Scalia). The  ’s Chris Cox responded to the nomination of Gorsuch, saying, “President Trump has made an outstanding choice in nominating Judge Gorsuch for the U. S. Supreme Court. He has an impressive record that demonstrates his support for the Second Amendment. We urge the Senate to swiftly confirm Judge Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, just as it did in confirming him to the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit by a unanimous voice vote. ” AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of “Bullets with AWR Hawkins,” a Breitbart News podcast.

"’This is for Syria!’: Police Shoot Algerian Hammer Attacker at Notre-Dame, Paris",Breitbart,Oliver JJ Lane,2017-06-06,"French police shot an Algerian man who reportedly attacked them while shouting “this is for Syria” outside the   Cathedral in Paris, France. One officer is reported to have been injured in the incident. [Police reacted to the event in central Paris Tuesday afternoon, having shut down the neighbourhood, with some 900 tourists and worshippers locked into the   Cathedral for their safety.  French television network BFMTV reports the assailant, who is said to have attacked a police officer with a hammer while shouting “this is for Syria” had been seen “on the ground” and that he had been shot in the chest. A search after the event found that in addition to the hammer, the man was also carrying two knives. The assailant is reported to have been a    Algerian student. Witnesses spoke of two shots fired, which came after the assailant reportedly went after members of the public with the hammer, before turning on a pair of policemen. After striking one in the head, the second officer used his firearm. The injured parties were subsequently taken to hospital.

Armstrong and Green: What Does the March for Science Mean by ’Science’?,Breitbart,J. Scott Armstrong and Kesten C. Green,2017-04-22,"What is the “Scientific method”? [Saturday’s March for Science calls for “robustly funded” science and “political leaders and policy makers to enact evidence based policies in the public interest. ”  But is this just an attempt to dress up the marchers’ political beliefs as science? And what do they mean by science?  Fortunately for those who care, there is a remarkable level of agreement in the writings of scientific pioneers such as Francis Bacon, Isaac Newton, and Benjamin Franklin on the nature of the scientific method. That agreement is also reflected in the definition provided by the Oxford English Dictionary. We have expanded on the established definition and identified eight necessary criteria for a work to be considered useful science. The criteria include objectivity and full disclosure. We expect that most scientists would agree with these criteria as obviously true and important. The pioneers of science charted the way by describing how to comply with the criteria. To be objective, according to Newton, the study should compare all reasonable hypotheses by using a fair and balanced experimental design. We have summarized the eight criteria on a   checklist (available at guidelinesforscience. com). You can easily refer to it to assess whether something you are looking at is a work of science. By using the checklist, you do not have to depend on an authority to tell you “this is what the science says. ” Knowing and agreeing with the criteria in the checklist does not help. To be useful, the checklist must be used. The checklist is concerned only with the scientific method, so one does not need to be an expert in the field or topic to use it. In fact, experts may have difficulty rating the scientific compliance of works in their own field.  They are likely to be biased against findings that challenge conventional wisdom. We found that the ratings of raters who did not use the checklist were unreliable. Their ratings differed substantially from those derived using the checklist. When faculty and students raters used the checklist, their ratings were remarkably consistent. The checklist is available at guidelinesforscience. com. The checklist is badly needed. One cannot rely on the fact that a purported discovery was published in a   scientific publication. When we used the checklist to rate papers published in leading scientific journals, we found less than one percent of them to be compliant with the scientific method. We suggest that you try out the checklist at the March for Science rallies. Show your respect for the scientific method and, as Newton emphasized, be willing to consider alternatives. Be fair in evaluating alternative hypotheses. You have to ask yourself the question, “Can I imagine any evidence that would prove my favored hypothesis is wrong?” If you can’t, you are not approaching the subject with an open mind. You also fail Newton’s criteria for understanding science. Speakers should comply with science. Listeners should be respectful and request of the speakers, “Please show us that you have complied with science. ” It’s not enough for them to say that they have followed the scientific method. Progress in all fields relies on the scientific method. Science is a     process. Voting has no place in science. Scientific laws always eventually prevail over the political laws created by our elected officials. The March for Science should not simply be another way for us to express our opinions. It should not be an effort to pressure scientists and voters to agree with us. The scientific method is the best way we have of engaging in factual disputes. J.

Immigration Patriots ’Thrilled’ About Trump Tossing Out DAPA,Breitbart,John Binder,2017-06-17,"After President Trump’s administration announced it would toss out an   amnesty program for up to five million illegal aliens,   immigration hawks are cheering as they have a   hope in the White House. [In a joint statement, Department of Homeland Security Secretary (DHS) John Kelly and Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA) amnesty program would officially be tossed out.  Immigration patriots say that are “thrilled” by the major immigration decision. “NumbersUSA and its 8 million activists are thrilled that Secretary Kelly has rescinded the DAPA amnesty, partially fulfilling one of President Trump’s key campaign promises,” NumebersUSA’s Chris Chmielenski said in a statement. Chmielenski said that by the Trump administration ending the DAPA amnesty program, American workers have been spared having to compete with more immigrants in a scarce American job market. “Although this unconstitutional executive amnesty had been temporarily blocked by the courts, it threatened to issue 5 million new work permits to illegal aliens who would mostly compete with   American workers who still face   unemployment rates and declining wages,” Chmielenski continued. Breitbart Texas covered the trial in South Texas in Judge Andrew Hanen where the judge not only blocked the order but had harsh words for Obama Administration lawyers. President of the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) Dan Stein praised Trump’s decision to end DAPA as a win for the rule of law. “Yesterday’s action by the administration also acknowledges that granting de facto amnesty to millions of people who knowingly violated U. S. immigration laws is also bad public policy that harms the interests of the American people and encourages more illegal immigration,” Stein said in a statement. “Many working class Americans voted for President Trump because of his promise to combat illegal immigration and secure U. S. jobs for American workers. They are the major beneficiaries of this action. ” Though the Trump administration kept their promise on throwing out the   amnesty program, it has been less active in ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which essentially gives amnesty to young illegal aliens. In his statement praising Trump, Chmielenski asked the White House to keep their campaign promise and end the DACA program. “We hope President Trump now will keep his entire promise by ordering an end to the Obama Administration’s other unconstitutional amnesty, the DACA program which continues to issues new work permits to those here illegally,” Chmielenski said. Stein issued a similar statement on DACA, saying the program was just as legally questionable and hurtful to Americans as DAPA. “Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) granted to more than 780, 000 illegal aliens who arrived in the U. S. as minors, was a similar example of an executive overreach that was based on the same flawed legal principle,” Stein said. “Clearly, DACA raises the same legal questions that ultimately resulted in the termination of DAPA. This calls into question the legitimacy of DACA as well. ” John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart Texas. Follow him on Twitter at @JxhnBinder. "
"After Super Bowl Ad Flap, 84 Lumber CEO Says She Backs Trump and Border Wall",Breitbart,Dan Riehl,2017-02-08,"John Carney, Breitbart News economics editor, joined Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Wednesday to discuss the recent Super Bowl ads, including the   84 Lumber ad, which drew a considerable amount of attention. [In response to Marlow’s saying it usually does not make news if conservative backlash damages a company’s bottom line, Carney said, “It hasn’t been traditionally. But I think when you see  as extreme as what we saw with 84 Lumber, the longer version, which is on YouTube, which the NFL actually turned down to show   because it was too political  —   but they still insisted on making it available   …     I think this is saying, much like Kellogg but not just about Breitbart, about America, about people who voted for Donald Trump, about the country as a whole. ”  Added Carney, “84 Lumber is saying we don’t share your values. And I think Americans are going to look at that. ” As the controversy grew, 84 Lumber CEO Maggie Hardy Magerko appeared to walk back any perceived opposition to a border wall and President Trump. She said the ad “was not meant to be   or a political statement at all” and that she is “a staunch supporter of President Donald Trump,” who thinks a border wall “is a need. ” Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m.

Obama’s State Department Sponsored 2016 Meeting of Russian Ambassador with Sen. Sessions - Breitbart,Breitbart,Neil Munro,2017-03-03,"President Barack Obama’s Department of State sponsored the July event in Ohio where Sen. Jeff Sessions met the Russian ambassador for the second time in 2016, according to the organizers of the event. [The July 20 meeting in Cleveland was used by the Washington Post’s March 1 headline to double the number of meetings where Sessions met with Russians in 2016. “Sessions met with Russian envoy twice last year, encounters he later did not disclose,” said the headline, which has created a   as Democratic partisans push for Sessions’ resignation from his post as the nation’s Attorney General, amid Democratic claims that the Russian government helped Donald Trump win the 2016 election.  The   event was hosted by a civic organization, Global Cleveland, whose website cites the state department’s role: On Tuesday, July 19, Global Cleveland welcomed roughly 80 international ambassadors to its Global Partners in Diplomacy reception at Severance Hall. The event, coordinated in partnership with the 2016 Republican National Convention and the U. S. Department of State, introduced the ambassadors to nearly 200 of Northeast Ohio’s civic and corporate leaders.   …    . The [first] evening’s keynote speaker, U. S. Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, stressed the importance of understanding what “having people of different backgrounds and origins means to your community. ”   …     Click here to see pictures from the event: https:  . facebook.   ? tab=albumalbum_id=1105759579497225, The July 19 activities were covered by Cleveland. com, which quotes one of the organizers saying “We are working very closely with the State Department and the RNC to make sure folks coming to Cleveland are filled in with everything they need to know about, including that Cleveland is awesome. ” The revelation of the State Department’s role in arranging Sessions’ brief meeting with the Russian ambassador comes as news reports sketch out a large effort by deputies working for outgoing President Barack Obama to track and disseminate information about Donald Trump and his deputies. The Washington Post article used the Ohio event to justify its   claim that Sessions held “meetings” with the Russian ambassador, Sergei Kisylak. According to the article’s lede:  . Jeff Sessions ( .) spoke twice last year with Russia’s ambassador to the United States, Justice Department officials said, encounters he did not disclose when asked about possible contacts between members of President Trump’s campaign and representatives of Moscow during Sessions’s confirmation hearing to become attorney general  …     The previously undisclosed discussions could fuel new congressional calls for the appointment of a special counsel to investigate Russia’s alleged role in the 2016 presidential election. But the Washington Post only briefly described the Ohio meeting in the 32nd and 33rd paragraphs of the story, saying: Two months before the September meeting, Sessions attended a Heritage Foundation event in July on the sidelines of the Republican National Convention that was attended by about 50 ambassadors. When the event was over, a small group of ambassadors approached Sessions as he was leaving the podium, and Kislyak was among them, the Justice Department official said. Sessions then spoke individually to some of the ambassadors, including Kislyak, the official said. In the informal exchanges, the ambassadors expressed appreciation for his remarks and some of them invited him to events they were sponsoring, said the official, citing a former Sessions staffer who was at the event. Sessions said he also met the Russian ambassador in September, with two of his senior staff. The meeting became “testy” when the subject of Ukraine was broached, he said at a March 2 press conference.    "
CNN’s Bash on NYT Report: The Deep State Knows How to ’Get Back Even If You’re President’ - Breitbart,Breitbart,Pam Key,2017-05-16,"Tuesday on CNN’s “Situation Room,” while reacting to a New York Times report that in February President Donald Trump asked former FBI Director James Comey to end the investigation into Trump’s former national security adviser Michael Flynn, network chief political correspondent Dana Bash said the deep state knew “how to get back, even if you’re the president of the United States. ”  Bash said, “So explosive. So incredibly serious. The Times report also says that James Comey created similar memos after the other meetings that he had with the president. So this could be just the tip of the iceberg. Maybe the most explosive, but it’s very clear that James Comey wanted to get out there that this happened, created this paper trail real time, contemporaneously rather, in order to protect himself from exactly what happened last week, him being fired, him being blamed. You know, wanting to know that he has sort of the information at his disposal if, in fact, this happened. ” She continued, “If you just take a step back, Wolf, just in the past 24 hours, right or wrong, what this president has done, his first 100 plus days, even before he came into office is pick fights with the intelligence community and now the law enforcement community. Particularly the way, never mind he fired James Comey, but the way in which he did it, not giving him the respect of actually telling him in person or at least not having him find out from cable news. So we know that they talk about the deep state —  well these are communities that have a lot of loyalty within and know how to get back, even if you’re the president of the United States. ” “And the fact is that when the intelligence community found out about the conversation that the president had with the Russians, talking about classified information, we don’t know all the details,” she added. “We’re told that it wasn’t as bad as it might have seemed initially, that’s what the White House sources are saying, but still, the intelligence community leaked that out. Now we know that the FBI director was keeping notes on many things. But the fact that this is the first one that he made clear and made public and it’s so incredibly explosive, as Jeff said, is the clearest most dangerous sign yet of potential obstruction of justice. Makes you think, what else is going to happen? And it’s very hard for Republicans who have in the past 24 hours been more aggressively critical of the president begging for a   day or   hour, very hard for them not to take this incredibly seriously. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN"
Erdogan: Soon Europeans ’Will Not Walk Safely on Their Streets’,Breitbart,Chris Tomlinson,2017-03-22,"Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has warned the European Union (EU) that if the diplomatic spat between Turkey and several European countries continues, Europeans won’t be able to walk their own streets safely. [President Erdoğan made the comments Wednesday in what is another increase of tensions between Turkey and the EU that began when Germany and the Netherlands banned several Turkish ministers from holding campaign rallies for the upcoming Turkish referendum. Erdoğan has threatened Europe before, but this time he threatened the safety of Europeans if the row continues, Die Welt reports.  “If you continue to behave like this, not a single European, not a single Westerner will be able to take a step on the road safely anytime in the world,” Erdoğan said at a press conference adding: “We as Turkey are calling on Europe to respect human rights and democracy. ” Erdoğan did not go into specifics of the threat, though many Turks living in countries like Germany and the Netherlands have expressed massive support for him following the failed coup attempt last year. Shortly after the coup, tens of thousands of Turkish expats attended a rally in Cologne, Germany, to express support for Erdoğan. On the night two Turkish ministers were refused entry in the Netherlands earlier in March, hundreds of Turks flooded the streets of Rotterdam and rioted. Following the actions of the Netherlands, Erdoğan and his government have suspended   diplomatic relations with the Dutch and even accused the country of being complicit in the Srebrenica massacre calling them “Nazi remnants“. Germany has also seen heated rhetoric from Ankara and   Turkish press who depicted German Chancellor Angela Merkel as a Nazi on the cover of newspaper Gunes. Many in Europe are concerned what effect the row will have on the migrant deal made between the EU and Turkey last year. The deal rapidly slowed the number of migrants crossing from Turkey to Greece from hundreds a day to dozens. The Turks have made it clear that the deal is on the table and have threatened to scrap it and send 15, 000 migrants a month to Europe. Erdoğan said the political bloc can “forget about” the migrant deal and that it is, for all intents and purposes, dead.  The Turkish government has threatened the deal before when Ankara became frustrated with the lack of   access to the bloc for Turkish citizens. More troubling has been a recent report that showed an abnormal increase in the number of migrant arrivals over the past week. Some have attributed the rise in sea landings to improved weather conditions, while others question whether this may be the first signs of the end of the migrant deal.

Cal State Prof. Says Trump Should Have Twitter Access Revoked over Climate Change Beliefs - Breitbart,Breitbart,Tom Ciccotta,2017-01-05,"Professor Joseph Palermo of California State University argued that Donald Trump should have his Twitter access revoked because of his beliefs on climate change. [In an editorial piece for The Huffington Post, Palermo addressed his concerns over climate change denial on the political right. Palermo argued that Trump shouldn’t be allowed to use internet technology like Twitter because of his attitudes towards climate change science.  “I’ve always believed that people who dismiss science in one area shouldn’t be able to benefit from science in others,” he wrote. “If Trump and his cohort believe the science of global warming is bogus then they shouldn’t be allowed to use the science of the Internet for their Twitter accounts, the science of global positioning for their drones, or the science of nuclear power for their weaponry. ” Palermo claimed that Trump wasn’t the only influential republican that he was concerned about with regards to attitudes towards climate change science. It’s not just the people around Trump who reject the science of climate change. The leadership of the Republican Party  —   from House Speaker Paul Ryan to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, to the chairs of the key science and technology committees in Congress, to the Republicans’ favorite think tanks  —   all share the fossil fuel industry’s preference that the U. S. government does nothing to address the most serious planetary crisis humanity has ever faced. The Republicans’ cravenness on climate change is clear. After claiming for years that the science was “inconclusive” (or a “hoax”) they held the public position that they opposed any concerted action to reduce greenhouse gases because China and India would never go along. Then, in 2015, when China and India signed on to the Paris Climate accords, Mitch McConnell and the Republican leaders began telling foreign governments that the Republicans would fight against any international deal on climate change in any case. Palermo has a history of radical statements. Writing in the LA Progressive, Palermo claimed that the 2016 Presidential election “felt at times like the prolonged public lynching of the nation’s first black president. ”"
Supreme Court Begins First Sitting of Trump Presidency,Breitbart,Ken Klukowski,2017-02-20,"WASHINGTON —  Tuesday, the Supreme Court will begin its first sitting in which the U. S. Department of Justice (DOJ) will reflect the views and priorities of President Donald Trump, inaugurating a new direction in American law. [The Supreme Court hears roughly 80 cases per year, divided into seven monthly sittings. The annual term begins with its first sitting on the first Monday in October, and the last sitting for each annual term is conducted over two weeks in April.  The Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) represents the United States before the U. S. Supreme Court. The office is led by a solicitor general (SG) who is nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate, assisted by a principal deputy solicitor general who is a presidential appointment not subject to Senate confirmation. These two appointees oversee a team of close to twenty attorneys who are mostly career staff, the senior ones holding the rank of deputy solicitor general, and the junior members being called assistant to the solicitor general. Together, they constitute one of the finest appellate legal teams in the nation. President Trump has not yet nominated an SG but has already named a deputy, Noel Francisco, as the   at OSG. Francisco is a Supreme Court rock star, a former clerk to Justice Antonin Scalia and former partner at powerhouse firm Jones Day who has argued a number of major cases before the justices. Francisco has control over OSG until such time as Trump’s pick for the top spot is chosen and confirmed, which might not occur for another couple months. Although OSG has already filed its legal briefs for most of the year’s remaining Supreme Court cases, changes or updates can be made during oral argument or with certain supplemental filings, so the Trump DOJ can make the new president’s views known as the justices tackle a number of issues involving the federal government. This Tuesday, the Court will hear arguments in Hernandez v. Mesa, a case in which a Mexican teenager on the Mexican side of the U. S.  border was fatally shot by a U. S. Border Patrol agent on the U. S. side of the border. The teenager’s family said he was playing pranks by touching the Mexico side of the border barrier, while DOJ insists that the young man was part of a group of teenagers throwing large rocks at the agent, posing a serious risk to the officer’s safety and disregarding repeated warnings to drop the rocks and back away. DOJ will be represented by Deputy Solicitor General Edwin Kneedler, a career veteran at OSG who has argued more than 100 times before the High Court, representing both Republican and Democrat presidents. The second case on Tuesday will be McLane v. EEOC. The private litigant is represented by Dallas attorney Allyson Ho, a partner at Morgan Lewis  Bockius, who, like Francisco, is a favorite among conservatives and an accomplished Supreme Court litigator who previously clerked for a Supreme Court justice. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission will be presented by an assistant to the solicitor general, Rachel Kovner. The makeup of the nation’s highest court is also changing. One of its nine seats has been vacant since the February 2016 death of Justice Antonin Scalia. But President Trump’s nominee, Judge Neil Gorsuch, appears unstoppable for confirmation, and is expected to join the Court this April. Between new lawyers leading OSG and new justices joining the nation’s highest court, February 2017 marks the beginning of a new trend in the legal arguments and decisions at the Supreme Court, a trend that will continue for at least the next four years.

French Universities Play Politics by Emailing Students to Vote Macron,Breitbart,Jack Montgomery,2017-05-05,"French university academics have made an extraordinary intervention in the French election, emailing students and urging them to back establishment candidate Emmanuel Macron. [The president of the University of Angers in Western France, Christian Roblédo, claimed in an email to students that, “as a university professor” it was his “duty to denounce the harmful ideology that [Marine Le Pen] conveys”.  He characterised this ideology as “withdrawal into oneself, intolerance, fear of the other [and] refusal of differences” in opposition to “humanism, openness, pluralism and freedom of expression”  —   the values which, in Roblédo’s estimation, “constitute the very essence of higher education and research in France”. “Already in 2002, we were placed before such a choice,” he said, recalling the second round showdown between Jacques Chirac and Marine Le Pen’s father,  . Mr. Le Pen was expelled from the Front National by his daughter as she reformed it into a moderate, populist movement. “[In 2002] a Republican front had come together to make the Front National score as low as possible,” wrote Roblédo. “[Again] we have to vote massively so that [Marine Le Pen] does not win the presidential election. ” Anticipating criticism of his intervention as an abuse of his public position, the professor concluded by saying that “[Sometimes] the values of a man’s life take precedence over all other considerations. In addressing you as president of the University, the duty of reserve is obliterated by the threats to the institutional foundations on which our University is based. ” WATCH | @MLP_officiel to @EmmanuelMacron: ”France will be led by a woman, either me or Angela Merkel!” 👏🇷😂 pic. twitter.   —   LEAVE.

Austin Schools Jump on ’Sanctuary’ Bandwagon,Breitbart,Merrill Hope,2017-02-21,"In a special session held Monday evening, Austin Independent School District trustees voted   to adopt a sanctuary policy resolution that strives to “create a safe and caring learning environment so as to foster a culture of trust and respect” for all students “regardless of their immigration status or the status of their parents. ”[The school board’s resolution calls for “schools and classrooms” that are “safe, welcoming and inclusive places, noting “all children are entitled to a public education” based on the 1982 United States Supreme Court ruling, Plyler v. Doe, which protects   illegal immigrant minors from discrimination and requires that U. S. public schools educate these students. The document did not mention the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) which prohibits schools from turning over student immigration status to federal agents, as Breitbart Texas reported.

Trump Promises White House Will No Longer Obscure Iraq and Syria Troop Deployments,Breitbart,John Hayward,2017-04-27,"President Trump has authorized military commanders to reset the complex system of troop limits in the Iraqi and Syrian theaters. The Pentagon announced no immediate changes, but supporters of Trump’s decision say it will sweep away a veil of political obfuscation President Obama placed over troop deployments. [To put it bluntly, the Obama administration did not honestly report how many U. S. “boots on the ground” were placed in Iraq and Syria. As Reuters explains:  The Force Management Level system was introduced in Iraq and Syria during Barack Obama’s administration as a way to exert control over the military. Obama periodically raised FML limits to allow more troops in Iraq and Syria as the campaign against Islamic State advanced. But the numbers did not reflect the extent of the U. S. commitment on the ground since commanders found often    ways to work around the limits  —   sometimes bringing in forces temporarily or hiring more contractors. The force management levels, which are officially at 5, 262 in Iraq and 503 in Syria, are believed to be more than a couple of thousands troops shy of the actual number of U. S. forces in both countries. “We want our reporting to Congress and to the public to be more easily and clearly understood,” said Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White. “We will conduct a review to ensure that the numbers we provide to Congress and to the public accurately reflect the facts on the ground. This is about transparency. ” One particular area of clarity mentioned in the Pentagon’s announcement is the number of troops on “temporary” deployment. In the past, such temporary assignments were a convenient way to bypass the troop limits without admitting more American personnel were being deployed to the Iraq and Syrian theaters since “temporary” deployments didn’t count. “Bringing the authority really back here where it’s historically been enables military commanders to be more agile, to more quickly and efficiently support partners, to have more rapid   and to keep units together,” said Pentagon spokesman Capt. Jeff Davis. The Pentagon emphasized that it plans to continue its focus on training and equipping local forces, rather than dramatically increasing the number of U. S. troops in the region. As Reuters goes on to point out, President Obama’s deception was not only directed at domestic audiences. Hostile entities in Iraq and Syria, notably   militia leaders like Shiite imam Moqtada   are already agitating for fewer American troops in the battle to recapture Mosul from ISIS. A larger U. S. footprint could mean political problems for the Iraqi government. Military. com calls Trump’s order a “major reversal of Obama administration policy” and wonders if Secretary of Defense James Mattis will eventually have the authority to deploy more troops to Afghanistan where the security situation has been degrading steadily, and South Korea, where the security situation might degrade rather abruptly. The change announced by the Trump White House and Pentagon is limited to Iraq and Syria at the moment. “The decision by Trump to delegate more authority to Mattis followed complaints by three defense secretaries who served under Obama  —   Robert Gates, Leon Panetta and Chuck Hagel  —   about being ‘micromanaged’ by White House officials on military matters,” Military. com notes."

WATCH: NY Governor Cuomo At Yad Vashem: Antisemitic Acts ’Disgustiing’,Breitbart,Deborah Danan,2017-03-06,"TEL AVIV  —   The recent wave of antisemitic acts in the U. S. is “disgusting” and “reprehensible,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said at Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial in Jerusalem on Sunday, adding that his state would take “extraordinary measures” to fight the trend. [Cuomo’s remarks came on the heels of what was originally believed to have been an act of vandalism in which headstones at a Jewish cemetery in Brooklyn were overturned.  Authorities later determined the graves were damaged as a result of environmental and other factors.  There have been over 120 bomb threats made to Jewish institutions all over the U. S. and desecrations of several Jewish cemeteries.  Cuomo, who visited Israel in a   act of solidarity, said the wave of antisemitism “violates every tenet of the New York State tradition. ” “New York State by its definition is a celebration of diversity, it accepts all who believe in the spirit of inclusion and who live by discrimination of none. New York’s principles are built on a rock, they will not change, and the political wind will not change them,” he said. His state, he said, has “put together a special unit of the state police” to deal with the issue, and has “reacted aggressively with extraordinary measures, more aggressively than any other state in the nation” to the attacks. New York has the largest Jewish population outside of Israel. “We have made it clear that there will be no tolerance for these acts of antisemitism,” Cuomo said. “My sadness is that now another generation of young people has had to experience this pain,” he said. “A pain that for many young people was only in the history books is now very much in their daily lives. These acts of antisemitism have also transpired on college campuses, so an entirely new generation has been exposed. ” Cuomo, who toured Yad Vashem with President Reuven Rivlin, said the   trip to Israel had two main goals: “Number one, while some would weaken the relationship between the people of the State of New York and our Jewish brothers and sisters, the purpose of this trip is to strengthen those relationships through cultural exchange [and] through economic development partnerships, and we’ll be working on them. ” Using the Hebrew word for “here I am,” he added, “The second purpose of this trip is ‘Hineini.’ I am here, I have been here before, and I will be here again. ” Rivlin praised Cuomo for his solidarity, saying that it is “an extremely important signal that the U. S. people and government will not let antisemitism win. ” Rivlin added that Israel was indebted to President Donald Trump for his condemnation of the attacks, in addition to the words and gestures of Vice President Mike Pence, who visited a vandalized Jewish cemetery in St. Louis. During the Holocaust, the president noted, the U. S. was a “rare island of safety” for the Jews. “We can never, ever, let that change,” he added. Cuomo will also meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat, visit the Western Wall and attend a security briefing at Jerusalem’s Old City Police Headquarters before heading back to the U. S. on Monday."

Donald Trump Denounces ’Un-American’ Intelligence Leaks to ‘Fake News’ - Breitbart,Breitbart,Charlie Spiering,2017-02-15,"President Donald Trump denounced reporting from the New York Times and the Washington Post that said his campaign was communicating with Russia.  “Information is being illegally given to the failing New York Times and Washington Post by the intelligence community,” he wrote on Twitter, suggesting that the NSA and the FBI might be responsible. “Just like Russia,” he added. The New York Times cited law enforcement and intelligence agency sources that intercepted communications from people close to Trump during the presidential campaign with Russian intelligence. “The real scandal here is that classified information is illegally given out by ‘intelligence’ like candy,” Trump wrote. “Very  !” That news is leading coverage of the president on cable and network news stations, prompting Trump’s reaction on Twitter. “The fake news media is going crazy with their conspiracy theories and blind hatred,” Trump wrote. “MSNBC and CNN are unwatchable. Fox and Friends is great!” Trump called the reports “ ” and said they were “merely an attempt to   the many mistakes made in Hillary Clinton’s losing campaign. ” He also praised Bloomberg columnist Eli Lake, for discussing his latest column on Fox News, pointing out that the damaging intelligence leaks were the kind of behavior seen in “banana republics. ” “We trust the NSA and the FBI to use these powers to catch criminals and terrorists but that should not interfere in our politics, and that stuff is interfering right now in our politics,” Lake said in an interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity.  —   @realDonaldTrump referring to this @EliLake segment on @seanhannity last night that was   on @foxandfriends this morning pic. twitter.   —   Charlie Spiering (@charliespiering) February 15, 2017,  Trump reminded the world that Russian President Vladimir Putin’s unchecked aggression began during the Obama administration. “Crimea was TAKEN by Russia during the Obama Administration,” he wrote. “Was Obama too soft on Russia?”"
Sen. McConnell: The Supreme Court Vacancy Was Key to President Trump’s Win - Breitbart,Breitbart,Warner Todd Huston,2017-04-08,"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R, KY) recently insisted that the open seat on the U. S. Supreme Court just filled by Justice Neil Gorsuch was a key factor in President Donald Trump’s White House victory last November. [Speaking of the the Supreme Court vacancy, Sen. McConnell told the Washington Examiner, “At the end, this issue more than any other elected Donald Trump, because, at the end, you had two candidates who were overwhelmingly unpopular. ”  McConnell noted that blocking President Obama’s nomination of Judge Merrick Garland to fill the Supreme Court seat suddenly left vacant after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia in February of 2016 was important. As Obama’s remaining months in office wound down last year, he made the uncommon move of nominating a replacement for Scalia instead of waiting for the results of the   election and allowing the next president to make a nomination. As leader of the Senate, McConnell decided not to allow the Garland nomination to move forward, arguing that since the election was so close, the next president  —   whether it be Trump or Clinton  —   should be allowed the nomination. According to McConnell, the possibility that a Republican could get the next nomination energized the drive to elect Trump. “Nobody was predicting Trump would get 90 percent of the Republican vote just like Mitt Romney did [in 2012,] but he did,” McConnell said. “And the single biggest reason was, they wanted him to make the Supreme Court appointment, not Hillary Clinton. ” “This call was made in February,” McConnell concluded. “We didn’t know who our nominee was going to be yet. What I did not predict was that we would nominate somebody who a lot of Republicans questioned whether he was a Republican. I mean, after all, Donald Trump was having fundraisers for [Senate Minority Leader] Chuck Schumer four or five years ago. ” Before his election, Donald Trump met with several groups of conservatives and asked for their recommendation as to whom he should pick for the Supreme Court and then made the unusual move of publicizing his list of possible picks. Trump’s move brought in many voices of support for his campaign that he may not otherwise have won. Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail. com"

CNN’s W. Kamau Bell: Islam Part of America’s Founding - Breitbart,Breitbart,Joel B. Pollak,2017-05-29,"CNN’s W. Kamau Bell devoted a recent episode of his series United Shades of America to exploring Muslim and Arab communities. [Aside from some interesting vignettes, the program is     propaganda that firmly establishes the network’s political bias. Bell also serves up some historical distortions of the sort spoonfed to undergraduates on   campuses, such as the claim that Islam has always been present in the U. S.  “Islam has always been part of the American fabric,” one Muslim man in Detroit tells Bell at an   event. “A lot of people think that Islam is from a foreign country, or is a foreign religion. It’s not  —   it’s very American. ” He goes on to criticize “those more violent voices in our society”  —   and he does not mean radical Islamists. Bell is so impressed that he asks the man, “When are you running for mayor?” comparing him to a “young Barack Obama. ” It was Obama who told the Muslim world in his Cairo speech in 2009: “Islam has always been a part of America’s story. ” He offered a dubious proof: “The first nation to recognize my country was Morocco. ” He also cited the Treaty of Tripoli, which was essentially an agreement to pay a bribe to Muslim pirates who had made a practice of kidnapping Americans. For CNN, the argument that Islam has “always” been present in the U. S. rests largely on the claim that a significant minority of black slaves were Muslim. On Saturday, CNN correspondent Dean Obeidallah claimed that “Islam has been here since the time of slavery, because ten to fifteen percent of the African slaves brought were Muslim. So Islam was here before the creation of the United States. It was actually part of the creation of the United States of America. ” Bell’s interviewee raises the estimate, claiming that “during the slave trade, up to about 25 to 30% of the slaves came from areas where there were predominantly Muslim populations. ”(Note that these claims leave out the role of Muslims in the slave trade itself, casting Muslims purely as victims.) There is some basis for some of the claims CNN cites. As Daniel Pipes noted in 2000, “Muslims constituted a significant percentage of the Africans brought to the Americas in servitude and that, as the most educated and resistant of the captive peoples, they exerted a disproportionate influence on slave life in the Americas. ” But the faith did not survive among these populations few of their descendants knew their forefathers’ Muslim origins. While Muslims were present at America’s founding, Islam  —   as a coherent,   religious and political civilization  —   was not. Had it been present, one would have expected the Founding Fathers to be more aware of it, and one would have expected to see an American version of the faith emerge, one more comfortable with ideas of tolerance and individual liberty, much as different reformist versions of Judaism flourished in the United States. To the extent that Islam was a part of early American history, it was a negative force, an external enemy. The predations of the Barbary pirates prompted the U. S. to build a   navy and deploy the fledgling Marines. As Brian Kilmeade and Don Yaeger recall in Thomas Jefferson and the Tripoli Pirates: The Forgotten War That Changed American History, Jefferson was shocked when, at a meeting in London with the Tripolitan ambassador and John Adams in 1786, the Muslim envoy declared that American Christians were fair game for piracy: “  …     all nations which had not acknowledged the Prophet were sinners, whom it was the right and duty of faithful persons to plunder and enslave. ” There are echoes of that Islamic supremacism in the public statements of the Council on   Relations (CAIR) whom Bell interviews jovially on CNN. After the San Bernardino terror attack in December 2015, CAIR not only ensured an Islamic burial for the terrorists and represented their family in court, but blamed the murder of 14 Americans and the wounding of 22 more at a Christmas party on U. S. foreign policy. (CAIR has been declared a terrorist organization by the United Arab Emirates, and was named by federal prosecutors as an unindicted   in a Hamas   operation  —   none of which Bell mentions.) Bell offers one additional argument to defend the idea that Islam is intrinsically American: “America has always had heroes who were Muslims. ” He cites Muhammad Ali, Kareem   and Malcolm X  —   none of whom were active in public life before the 1960s. Amazingly, he also praises the Nation of Islam and its leader, Louis Farrakhan. Bell cites Farrakhan’s “Million Man March”  —   and ignores his vicious racism and antisemitism. CNN’s effort at historical revisionism is not just aimed at encouraging Americans to adopt more tolerant attitudes toward Muslims, but to discourage awareness or criticism of aspects of contemporary Islamic political thought that clash with liberal democratic principles and that, in extremis, pose an active terrorist threat. Islam need not be seen as a foreign presence. But to claim that it predates, or was part of, the Founding, is fake history and “fake news. ” Americans are certainly tolerant enough to accept   and tolerant Muslim communities into the fabric of American social and political life without being taught lies about the role Islam played in our history, or being made to feel that Islam’s claims on this country precede almost anyone else’s.

Poll: 21% of American Voters Approve of Republican Healthcare Plan,Breitbart,Sean Moran,2017-05-12,"A recent Quinnipiac poll reveals that only 21 percent of American voters support the Republican healthcare plan, a slight raise from 17 percent in March. [Overall, 56 percent of U. S. voters oppose the American Health Care Act (AHCA). Nearly   of white, Republican college graduates support President Donald Trump’s actions on health care.    percent of voters believe that health insurance costs will increase, 11 percent of voters believe that costs will decrease, and 37 percent of voters believe that health premiums will remain the same. Americans also approve,   percent, of the current Obamacare statute that prevents health insurers from raising health premiums for patients with   conditions. Congressman Tom MacArthur ( ) who was heavily involved in drafting the AHCA, told Breitbart News that the new healthcare law also protects Americans with   conditions. MacArthur explained: The other side has spent too much time speaking to people’s emotions and misstating the facts.   For example, with   conditions the bill could not be more explicit that insurers cannot discriminate, they can’t deny coverage, they can’t deny renewals, they can’t health rate someone who’s sick in the middle of being insured. If you get sick, your health rates don’t skyrocket. What it does say is that if you don’t maintain coverage for more than 63 days, you will pay an extra premium. However, states can request a waiver to look at those people, but they have to create a risk pool to ensure that the neediest amongst are not left behind. It balances to make sure people don’t skip out on buying health insurance when they get sick. That’s not fair to the rest of the American people. Voters believe,   percent, including   percent of Republicans, that it is a “bad idea” to give states the ability to waive certain Obamacare regulations that might reduce the cost of premiums. The question that begins, “Do you think that giving states the ability to decide whether or not to allow health insurance companies to raise insurance rates for Americans with   conditions?” however, might influence the voters’ answers.   percent of Americans believe that it is “very important” or “somewhat important” that all Americans can afford health care. The opposition to the American Health Care Act may surprise voters, although the sample for the poll favors Democrats and independents: Registered Voters Party Identification: The 11 percent gap between Republicans compared to either Democrats or independents might skew the polling data towards those who might want to retain, rather than reform, Obamacare. Tim Malloy, the poll’s assistant director, said in a press release, “Republicans gave up on their first attempt to repeal and replace Obamacare when a March 23 Quinnipiac University poll showed 17 percent of American voters supported their bill. ” “The second attempt wins the support of 21 percent of voters,” Malloy added. “The grim diagnosis from voters: Health care will cost more and deliver less. ” Read the poll results here."
Fake News Plus Fascism: New York Times Urges Boycott of Breitbart,Breitbart,Joel B. Pollak,2017-01-08,"In two   articles for the New York Times‘ Sunday Review, the Gray Lady attacks Breitbart News and its founder, Andrew Breitbart, and encourages an effort to “destroy” the company by appealing directly to advertisers not to support the website. [One article, “How to Destroy the Business Model of Breitbart and Fake News,” written by someone actually called “Pagan Kennedy” (was “Antichrist Roosevelt” not available?) celebrates the flagging effort of anonymous Twitter trolls who have tried to target and intimidate companies whose ads appear alongside Breitbart News articles, via third party platforms.  These   censors of the totalitarian left have decided that since they cannot defeat conservative views and arguments on the merits, they would prefer to eliminate them. The Times, which prides itself as a guardian of free speech and press freedom, gives its backing to this (unsuccessful) campaign with nearly 2, 000 words of space. The article includes instructions on how to join the   effort, copied verbatim  —   “Step 1  …     Step 2  …    ”  —   from the anonymous activists’ Twitter page. And Breitbart News, the “biggest fish,” is not the last intended target: the group declares that it “would like to broaden its campaign to take on a menagerie of bad actors. ” Evidently it is very important to the Times that this failing, and   effort to censor Breitbart News be shored up, because it has allowed several embarrassing factual errors and omissions into the article which undermine both the credibility of the “Pagan” author and the   “paper of record” itself: Speaking of “fake news,” the New York Times is a prime exemplar of the genre, having manufactured several stories with the clear intent of attacking and undermining conservatives, including but not limited to Breitbart News. A few recent examples: As far as “hate” is concerned, the Times has published   by avowed terrorists like Ahmed Yousef of Hamas, the   organization that is determined to kill as many Israeli civilians as possible to achieve its genocidal aims. It has also published the work of Russian president Vladimir Putin, who is the left’s bogeyman today, but who in 2013 the Times wished to help reach a wider audience, the better to stop U. S. intervention in Syria and to attack American exceptionalism. In a second Sunday   “The Tea Party and the Art of the Mean Joke,” British travel writer Jonathan Raban concocts a twisted recollection of the Tea Party convention in Nashville in 2010 to explain, so he claims, the origins of Trump’s rhetorical style. Raban claims, erroneously, that Tea Party activists were dreaming of a politically incorrect “strongman”  —   a ridiculous and false claim, given the ambivalence of the Tea Party movement about political leaders in general (even their own). He goes on to claim that Trump “inherited the mantle of speaking in public like a   barfly from the man who turned out to be the star of the Nashville show: Andrew Breitbart, founder of the eponymous   media outlet. ” Evidently Trump’s long public record has eluded Raban, who argues that Trump learned his craft from Breitbart: “The   has the blunt pugnacity of the Breitbartian style. Like his tweets, his policy statements have the brutal concision of jokes. ” Raban goes on to compare Trump  —   and, by implication, Breitbart  —   to a Latin American dictator: “I once heard Jorge Luis Borges talk about how dictators relished cruel jokes as demonstrations of their power,” he says, relishing this bit of recalled armchair political philosophy as some kind of proof. In fact, in his lifetime  —   as Trump’s many detractors were wont to point out during the election  —   Andrew Breitbart had criticized Trump at times. (One area where Trump earned Andrew Breitbart’s praise: his ability to see through the media’s pretenses.) But again, never mind the facts. Raban describes Breitbart as a “  bully,” exactly inverting Breitbart’s character. Andrew stood up to bullies, and relished nothing more than confronting the bullies in the mainstream media  —   such as propagandists like Raban, who descend from upon high to pour scorn on the little people of Nashville,   their naïve effort at   democracy as a kind of nascent fascism, making up fake historical “facts” they expect no one will dare to challenge. Six years later, the little people of Nashville have finally won something, and the New York Times cannot stomach its loss. So it has attacked Breitbart News in an attempt to “destroy” it. There is no greater accolade than to be considered the Times‘ greatest enemy. But one expects something more effective  —   and more principled  —   from such a formerly august institution. Sadly, the Times has decided to go the fascist route, urging the destruction of its most effective conservative competitor, using “fake news” to make the case for censorship to its credulous   readership. It is an effort as illiberal as it is futile. Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News. He was named one of the “most influential” people in news media in 2016.

"Cartel Massacres, Rampant Corruption Taint Mexican Border State Elections",Breitbart,Ildefonso Ortiz and Brandon Darby,2017-05-23,"PIEDRAS NEGRAS, Coahuila  —   As the border state of Coahuila prepares for its upcoming gubernatorial election, the main issue that resonates with voters is how Los Zetas were able to murder and incinerate hundreds of victims while the government turned a blind eye. [In early June, the state of Coahuila will have its general elections to select the next governor, mayors, senators, and congressmen. As Breitbart Texas has been reporting, the process is closely linked to Mexican drug cartels. One of the candidates for the border city of Piedras Negras has a long list of relatives who are members of Los Zetas  including one regional commander.  Breitbart Texas has spoken with several residents of this border city who expressed their various viewpoints as to the ongoing situation in Coahuila, a state with a long history of being home to Mexican drug cartels and corrupt government officials. One of the key issues that residents kept bringing up is how state officials turned a blind eye to the various cartel massacres that took place in the state. As Breitbart Texas reported, from early 2011 to 2013, Los Zetas kidnapped, murdered and incinerated more than 300 victims from the rural communities in and around Allende. Half of those were incinerated inside the state prison in Piedras Negras.  Residents in Coahuila continue to ask themselves how Los Zetas were able to operate with complete impunity to carry out the mass executions, set fire to and destroy dozens of homes, and avoid facing any consequences. To date, government officials do not know how many people throughout the state have actually been kidnapped and murdered by cartel gunmen due to a systemic effort throughout Mexico where government officials try to downplay cartel violence.   At the time of the massacre and in the months after, the Coahuila Attorney General’s Office in the Piedras Negras and Allende region was run by Santos Vasquez Estrada and Patricia Rivera Barrera. Politically connected sources in Saltillo have revealed exclusively to Breitbart Texas that Rivera Barrera, who ignored the Allende massacre, continues to collect a director’s salary but has since been demoted to working at a PGJE archive where she handles documents tied to cases that have already been closed.  Santos Estrada has since left the PGJE and is now a criminal defense lawyer. According to Zocalo, the former prosecutor who turned a blind eye to the actions of Los Zetas became the defense attorney for Juan Manuel “Padre Meño” Riojas, a priest who has been criminally accused of having violated a seminary student. New information provided to Breitbart Texas revealed that the priest is now considered a fugitive after he went into hiding and is believed to have fled the region.  As Breitbart Texas reported, witness testimony from U. S. court cases and documents revealed that Los Zetas had free reign over Coahuila for many years where politicians sold control of the state in exchange for bribes. Some of the revelations point to Los Zetas having close ties to former governor Humberto Moreira, the brother of current governor Ruben Moreira. Both Moreira brothers were elected governors under Mexico’s Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) a political party that has a long history of being tied to drug cartels, Breitbart Texas reported. In Tamaulipas, two former governors are currently listed as fugitives of the U. S. Department of Justice on money laundering charges. One of those Tamaulipas governors is also wanted on drug trafficking and conspiracy charges.  Most recently, Humberto Moreira was kicked out of the PRI for running for a plurinominal congressional seat with the Partido Joven (Young Party). As Breitbart Texas reported, internal discussion within the PRI pointed to the party trying to distance themselves from Moreira in case the U. S. unveils a criminal case against him as they have done with the two former Tamaulipas governors. Most recently, Mexico’s Reforma reported on leaked documents that revealed Moreira and his relatives managed to stash away approximately $60 million in bank accounts in Monaco and the Cayman Islands. Since the publication of Reforma’s investigation, Moreira has gone on the offensive using a Facebook page and various interviews to call the outlet’s reporting a   lie.

WATCH: Netanyahu Thanks House For Condemning UN Resolution,Breitbart,Deborah Danan,2017-01-08,"TEL AVIV  —   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu thanked the U. S. House of Representatives on Friday for disavowing the UN Security Council’s resolution condemning Israeli settlement activity as a “flagrant violation of international law. ”[“After the outrageous   resolution at the UN, the U. S. House of Representatives voted yesterday resoundingly to support Israel and reject this   resolution,” Netanyahu said.  “I want to thank the U. S. House of Representatives, which reflects the tremendous support Israel enjoys among the American people. They voted to either repeal the resolution at the UN or change it  —   and that’s exactly what we intend to do. ” “Democrats and Republicans alike know that the Western Wall isn’t occupied territory,” he added. A similar measure is expected from the Senate this week. House Resolution 11 called on the U. S.  —   which abstained from the Security Council vote  —   to “oppose and veto future United Nations Security Council resolutions that seek to impose solutions to final status issues, or are   and  . ” “The passage of United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334 undermined the longstanding position of the United States to oppose and veto United Nations Security Council resolutions that seek to impose solutions to final status issues, or are   and   reversing decades of bipartisan agreement,” the resolution continues, in reference to President Barack Obama’s decision to abstain from the vote. The resolution echoes Israel’s view that the UN vote will make peace even more elusive, saying it “undermines the prospect of Israelis and Palestinians resuming productive, direct negotiations, contributes to the politically motivated acts of boycott, divestment from and sanctions against Israel and represents a concerted effort to extract concessions from Israel outside of direct negotiations. ” House Speaker Paul Ryan urged the entire House to support the resolution. “I am stunned  —   I am stunned at what happened last month,” Ryan said in a statement on the floor. “This government, our government, abandoned our ally Israel when she needed us the most. ” State Department spokesman John Kirby said over the weekend that the Obama administration’s decision to abstain from the vote “was about preserving the   solution, which we continue to believe is the only way to ensure Israel’s future as a Jewish and a democratic state  —   living    in peace and security with a viable and independent Palestinian state. ” However, many Republicans have expressed the view that the   solution is no longer viable. “The   solution has run its course,” said Rep. Steve King ( ) who is a close confidant of the incoming Trump administration. Israel is concerned that Obama may seek more resolutions defining parameters for a peace framework at the UNSC during his final days in office. However, the president’s foreign policy adviser, Ben Rhodes, has denied this and said the administration intends to use its veto. Meanwhile, Israel announced on Friday that it was cutting funding as “an act of protest” against UN agencies that are considered to be  . “It is unreasonable for Israel to fund bodies that operate against us at the UN,” Ambassador to the UN Danny Danon said. “The UN must end the absurd reality in which it supports bodies whose sole intent is to spread incitement and   propaganda. ”"

[“If someone was cruel enough to assassinate MLK, maybe someone will be kind enough to assassinate Trump,” Heather Lowrey, 26, of Louisville wrote on Twitter.  The Secret Service confirmed it interviewed Lowrey and is still investigating the incident, the New York Daily News reported. Lowrey posted the Tweet Jan. 17, three days before Trump’s inauguration. The Tweet disappeared not long after it was posted, along with all her social media accounts. The bio on her profile said she was a “a Louisville Vixen and aspiring WWE diva” before the account was taken down, the Daily News reported. No charges have been announced against her yet, but her former employers have already issued statements denouncing the Tweet and have severed ties with her, WAVE reported. Va Va Vixens, a burlesque group in Louisville, let Lowrey go as soon as they found out about the incident, citing a “zero tolerance policy” for her behavior. “We do not condone hate by any party and will not partake in it. We in no way support negative behavior or malicious intent from anyone,” the group said. American Income Life, Travis Moody Office, also severed ties with Lowrey and issued a statement on the company’s Facebook page saying, “Heather Lowrey is no longer contracted with the Travis Moody Agency. ” “The Travis Moody Agency, its agents and its staff do not share the same views, nor opinions as Heather Lowrey.

I don’t know the exact location of the   shooting, but I do know it was sometime during the pursuit. That’s why it was closed. It was all part of the   shooting investigation.

‘Asian Grooming Gang’ Drugged and Raped 12-Year-Old Girl,Breitbart,Liam Deacon,2017-01-06,"Five men from Rotherham, allegedly part of “Asian grooming gangs” are facing 23 charges of sexually abusing two girls, aged 12 and 13, over a   period. [In the first of two cases, a woman, now 28, claims she was forced to take drugs and drink alcohol before being raped by brothers Basharat Dad, now 32, and Nassar, now 36.  She met the men after skipping school, and the alleged attacks 16 years ago left her unable to identify the father of her child when it was born. The crimes are alleged to have taken place in a flat owned by the brothers’ family. Prosecutor Sophie Drake told the court that the men had targeted “vulnerable young girls,” according to the Daily Mail. “She was scared so she let them do what they wanted. They both raped her and she submitted to them,” added Mrs. Drake, “The brothers knew she was only 12 at the time. They gave her alcohol and drugs and were aggressive to her and she felt she had no choice. ” A third brother, Tayab Dad, is standing trial separately for raping a    who was attacked in the same flat. “As young teenagers in Rotherham they were sexually exploited by a number of men, they were vulnerable and given alcohol and cannabis and told to perform sexual acts,” Mrs. Drake said. The police were involved at the time, with the    naming her attackers after she fell pregnant. The brothers were arrested in 2001, along with Matloob Hussain, a    takeaway delivery driver, and Mohammed Sadiq, then 24. However, no charges were brought, despite the seriousness of the allegations. The government’s Jay Report describes how Rotherham authorities failed to intervene in numerous similar cases for fear of being labelled “racist”. Muslim rape gangs blighted the town Rotherham between 1997 and 2013, with more than 1, 200 girls affected according to a government report. However, the religion of this latest group of “Asian” attackers has not been reported. The alleged offences only resurfaced when South Yorkshire Police began investigating the sexual exploitation of young girls in Rotherham in 2014, shortly before the Jay Report was published. The     victim said she remembers waking up naked in bed, arguing that this proves she could not have consented to sex, even if of age, as she was asleep. Mrs. Drake said: “The brothers were aware she was under 16 and knew she was at school. They supplied her with alcohol and cannabis so that they could do what they wanted to. ”"
"BBC Comedy Sketch ""Real Housewives of ISIS"" Causes Outrage",Breitbart,Chris Tomlinson,2017-01-06,"The BBC produced spoof on the “Real Housewives” TV programmes, which has a comedic Islamic State twist, has been criticised by Leftists and Muslims who claim the sketch is offensive. [The BBC released the trailer earlier this week and were immediately slammed by those on the left and Muslims who thought that making fun of the brides of members of the terror group was out of the bounds of conventional humour. The sketch is part of a new programme called “Revolting” written by Jolyon Rubinstein and Heydon Prowse which, according to the BBC, is “satirising the state of the nation. ”  LOLOLOL pic. twitter.   —   Raheem Kassam (@RaheemKassam) January 4, 2017,  The BBC2 Facebook page was inundated with criticism. One user wrote, “I’m mortified that the BBC had produced such a programme. This is simply bad taste. The fact it is a comedy makes it even more worrying that humour should be associated with the actions of ISIS. Is this really what TV licenses are funding! ?” Others took a different point of view including a Muslim saying, “As a Muslim I find this HILARIOUS! Brilliant! The satire is on point highlighting the pathetic ideals of a pathetic group like ISIS. ” Not all Muslims agreed with the sentiment and users on Twitter expressed just as much outrage for the sketch.

Hawaii Lawmakers Ask State to Prepare for North Korea Missile Attack,Breitbart,Ben Kew,2017-04-17,"Lawmakers in Hawaii have asked state officials to update contingency plans and provide extra funding in anticipation of an attack from North Korea, amid escalating tensions between America and the communist state. [Last Thursday, the state’s House Public Safety Committee passed a resolution demanding extra resources for any potential attack, which includes the redevelopment of shelters last used during the Cold War.  Amongst other things, the resolution asks for the “restocking of fallout shelter provisions,” as well as calling on authorities to “conduct public awareness campaigns to ready the public for a nuclear disaster. ” “At a time when we have this kind of   and really blustering foreign policy, it does make people a little nervous,” said House Public Safety Committee Vice Chairman Matt LePresti. “They haven’t been updated since 1985. I was 11 years old when they were last updated. Many of the buildings that are on the fallout shelter list don’t exist anymore. ” Many experts have warned that Hawaii may be the first point of any potential North Korean attack, with its location in the   ocean far more reachable than the American west coast. The remote island is located 4, 660 miles from North Korea, while Los Angeles remains approximately 5, 800 miles in distance. An analysis carried by the BBC suggests that North Korea possesses over 1, 000 missiles, all with ranging capabilities. Some of their weapons, including the   ballistic missile, have an intercontinental range, meaning they can travel up to 5000 miles, just short of the American coastline. The request comes amidst rising tensions between the U. S. and North Korea, with Donald Trump warning last week that he was sending “an armada” into the region to fend off any potential threat. Meanwhile, on Sunday, North Korean forces held a military parade to celebrate the 105th birthday of former leader Kim   who remains the country’s “eternal leader. ” However, reports from South Korea also indicated that the country’s planned missile launch, intended to be a show of strength, ended in failure. On Monday, Vice President Mike Pence visited the Korean demilitarized zone, also the border between South and North. In an interview with CNN, Pence said that “the people in North Korea should make no mistake that the United States of America and our allies will see to the security of this region and see to the security of the people of our country. ” You can follow Ben Kew on Facebook, on Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart. com"
Michael Wolff on MILO’s ’Dangerous’: Publishing Is a Business - Breitbart,Breitbart,Breitbart Tech,2017-01-16,"In USA Today, journalist and author Michael Wolff explained to critics of Breitbart Senior Editor MILO’s upcoming book Dangerous that “the publishing businesses is a business,” pointing out that the publication of the book was inevitable given the profits that stood to be made. [“The traditional view, at least since publishing, in the late Victorian age, became a   and therefore respectable industry, is that if you publish it, you own it. You were not only legally responsible for it, but it firmly attached to your reputation,” Wolff explained. “This led to protocols about editing, fact checking, and the development of a long cannon of journalism standards and ethics. It also led to the idea of publishing brands. What you published defined you in the community and in the marketplace. ”  The Yiannopoulos book is a particularly good example of the breakdown of this view. Book imprints were once the staunchest cultural gatekeepers, with issues of taste and sales closely twinned, and with the decision to publish resting, often, on a small group of editors, or even on a single shoulder. You knew who was responsible. But then a massive consolidation of the business occurred, mixing and mashing brands, and, with new financial dictates, in essence, commoditizing books. Any book that makes financial sense to publish, no matter its nature, will, practically speaking, be published by any publisher. Beyond a book’s financial bona fides, there is no real vetting, or editing, or concerns about taste. Most of the book industry is now a business focused on creating products —  often novelty products connected to a celebrity —  for specific market segments. A new crop of conservative publishers were suddenly making lots of money publishing conservative books. Hence, every major publisher hurried to established its own conservative imprint  —   the Yiannopoulos book is published by Simon  Schuster’s Threshold Editions —  often run by liberals. In a sense, this is an example of the media overcoming its bias. In another sense, it’s purely cynical: we believe none of this, but the money’s good. Read the full article at USA Today."

Detroit Paper: Trump Immigration Plan ‘a Moral Stain’,Breitbart,John Binder,2017-01-27,"The editorial board of a Detroit newspaper wrote a frantic piece to its readers, calling President Donald Trump’s immigration plans “a moral stain. ”[The editors of the Detroit Free Press claim Trump’s promise to secure the   Border is an “attack America and American values”:  Trump’s vision for American immigration, egged on by a slew of   lawmakers, is an attack on America and American values —  on undocumented residents, sure, but also on the millions of American immigrants here lawfully. This kind of targeted enforcement marks out   Americans, regardless of immigration status, as different, other, suspect. It’s a clear demarcation of whom Trump and his cohort consider real Americans. The Detroit Free Press editorial board goes on to say that “the idea that a border wall would halt or even pause illegal immigration —  much less the idea that Mexico will volunteer payment for such a wall —  is absurd. ” However, Trump has proposed a 20 percent tax on imports coming into the U. S. from Mexico which would serve as a payment from Mexico for the border wall, as Breitbart News reported. Likewise, the claim that walls do not serve to secure borders has been challenged by the National Border Patrol Council, which has heralded Trump’s immigration plans, as Breitbart Texas reported. “We know we won’t have a wall along the 2, 000 miles of border,” the President for the Local 2455 of the National Border Patrol Council Hector Garza said. “What we will have is a wall where it is needed. That barrier with proper manpower, resources, technology and other tools will be effective. But most important, for the first time we have a president that wants to secure the border. ” The editorial board also wrote that Trump tapped into “bigoted fear” over immigration: But Trump gained a lot of his support by manipulating truth about America’s immigration challenges, by painting a picture of Latino and Muslim immigrants as, broadly, leeches and potential terrorists. That’s what his policies are about. That’s the bigoted fear he tapped into. The Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) has found that illegal immigrants are somewhat of a drain on American   social services, costing about $113 billion for them to live in the country, as Breitbart Texas reported. Ending the editorial, the Detroit Free Press calls on residents and citizens to be a “resistance” to Trump, writing, “there is undoubtedly much more to come. Which means the protests over his early actions may need to take a turn toward another tactic: resistance. ” John Binder is a contributor for Breitbart Texas. Follow him on Twitter at @JxhnBinder."
NY Times: Trump’s Deportation Efforts ’Not So Unusual’,Breitbart,John Binder,2017-02-17,"President Donald Trump’s deportation of hundreds of criminal illegal immigrants during his first month in office is “no so unusual,” according to The New York Times. [In analysis by the New York Times, Trump’s deportation effort to prioritize the removal of criminal illegal immigrants by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency shows that the enforcement actions are “not unprecedented”:  Last week, United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials arrested more than 680 people in at least 12 states, shown below, stoking fears that the Trump administration is increasing the arrests and deportations of undocumented immigrants. But a comparison of last week’s arrests and similar ones during the first four years of the Obama presidency show that the recent level of enforcement activity is not unprecedented. It is unclear, however, if the numbers are an actual increase in enforcement, because information on operations in only 12 states was disclosed. The New York Times analysis then described how Trump’s deportation efforts are on par with Obama’s, citing that the Obama administration “arrested an average of 675 immigrants a week in   ‘community arrests’. ” In Obama’s first term in office, the analysis notes that ICE agents arrested over 35, 000 illegal immigrants, more arrests than any year in the previous four years of former President George W. Bush: The weekly average of such arrests made by Immigration and Customs Enforcement fugitive teams under President Obama rose to 771 in 2011 and declined slightly to 719 the next year. Data after 2012 are not readily available, but in more recent years, the number of ICE apprehensions and removals decreased overall, especially after the Obama administration began to focus on convicted criminals. In Mr. Obama’s two terms in office, there were at least six known operations in which more than 500 people were arrested, according to an analysis by The New York Times. Opponents of Trump’s plans, though, told the New York Times that the difference between Obama’s deportation efforts and the current model, is that Trump uses a “broader definition” when referring to criminal illegal immigrants. The Obama administration was careful to say that only people who had very serious charges or were recent arrivals were priorities for enforcement, but now, everyone is a priority, Mr. Capps said. Under Obama, nearly 90 percent of the illegal immigrants deported by ICE were convicted criminals. Trump, on the other hand, takes into consideration illegal immigrants who have committed serious crimes, misdemeanors and those who have simply crossed the border. Some 75 percent of the 680 illegal immigrants arrested by ICE last week were convicted of crimes. The raids also included those who had illegally   the U. S. and who had been ordered for removal.

Bloomberg’s U.S. Consumer Comfort Index Highest It Has Been in a Decade - Breitbart,Breitbart,Katherine Rodriguez,2017-03-09,"Bloomberg’s U. S. Consumer Comfort Index has reached its highest point in a decade following positive assessments about the economy and the buying climate, according to Bloomberg Markets. [The consumer comfort index rose to 50. 6 as of March 5, the highest it has been since March 2007, from 49. 8. The index has surpassed 50 only six times since April 2002.  A measure of the economy rose to 48. 2, the highest since August 2001, from 46. 8, while a measure of buying climate rose to 44. 5, the highest since April 2002, from 43. 7. The stock market has jumped to record highs and the job market has been particularly strong since President Trump’s inauguration, causing the consumer comfort index to rise. Respondents to the index view the buying climate as the most favorable it has been in 15 years, a sign that there might be an uptick in household spending after a slow start in 2017. Sentiment has been strong among Republicans as well as political independents, who were the most confident about the economy and the buying climate since July 2001. Republicans’ sentiment has surpassed that of the Democrats by the most since September 2013. Confidence among people in the South and Midwest,   employees, and married Americans rose. For   employees, they were the most confident since October 2015, while married Americans saw the highest levels of comfort in a decade. Confidence did, however, fall for people living in the West and Northeast."
EXCLUSIVE – Islamic State Supporters: ‘Soon We’ll Attack the Snake’s Head and Destroy Iran’,Breitbart,Aaron Klein and Ali Waked,2017-06-08,"Writing in an encrypted chat room, Islamic State sympathizers and militants celebrated the deadly attacks on the parliament building in Iran and the tomb of the country’s Shiite revolutionary founder. [Breitbart Jerusalem obtained access to correspondence posted in a closed chat group that utilizes the encrypted Telegram messaging service. The group serves as an internal Twitter of sorts for IS jihadists and sympathizers, and has been used in the past to issue IS communications.  IS claimed responsibility for the attacks on Iran, which took place during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and appeared orchestrated in a manner to cause maximum civilian casualties. Writing in the encrypted Telegram group, IS member Abou Obaida Alsameraii exclaimed, “We thank Allah, ask his forgiveness and thank him for facilitating our attack and our hits. We are counting on Allah as we strike Allah’s enemies. This is a land of heresy, a capital of impurity, prostitution and profanity called Tehran. Today we attacked them in the depths of their land. We won’t let them only attack us. We did this to defend our Sunni nation and we are punishing our enemies. Today we attacked their parliament, attacked their temple and their cemeteries and soon we’ll attack the snake’s head and destroy Iran with the help of Allah. ” Another Telegram member who goes by the name “Prince of the Jihad and Death as a Martyr” wrote, “May your jihad be blessed and may your fight be blessed, you lions of the Islamic State, princes of jihad and those who die as martyrs. Today our brothers, with their bodies, struck and attacked the heretic capital of Tehran. With their blood, they’ve written a chapter in history, a new history. What was before today’s attack will never be the same. This is a new era and a new stage in which we will witness more hits from our brothers against the countries of heresy. ” Abi Abdullah Aljazrawi wrote, “Allah is great, Allah is great, Allah is great. Thanks to Allah. We worship Allah to thank him for causing the infidels and criminals to taste the attacks of our brothers. We swear to Allah that we will break them yet, that there will be more of these. We say to them, there will yet be soldiers who shake their lands. We swear to Allah that they will see the strength of our brothers, the mujahedeen. They will see what their mercenaries in Iraq and Syria have not yet seen. We will shake their lands. ” Abi Dajana Alhomsi wrote, “Allah is great. We strike in Syria, Iraq and infidel countries in Europe and those who stand at the head of American terror and today we strike the heresy of Iran as we struck not so long ago in Saudi Arabia and against the supporters of the Gulf states of prostitution. We swear to Allah that the country of Caliphs will spread in spite of the opposition. This will be a Caliphate in the way of the prophet, a Caliphate that does not compromise with the enemy or give mercy to evil. We swear to Allah that we will show them the strength of our mujahedeen, they will see power that they have never realized. ” Abi Rahman Aljazrawi wrote, “They accused our country and our Caliphate of being agents of Saudi Arabia, America and Iran. Everyday we prove to everyone that we are walking the path of the prophet. We are the agents of Islam and all these bastards have no value according to our religion as long as they do not return to the righteous path and as long as the Christians do not pay, with submission, the poll tax. We swear to Allah that we go with justice and Allah is the one supporting us and will bring us victory. You would love for us to be your agents and supporters. We are soldiers of Allah on Earth and we will tear up your roots and return to Islam. ” "
"Trump, critic of Obama’s golfing, regularly hits the links",CNN,Dan Merica,2017-03-19,"West Palm Beach, Florida (CNN) President Donald Trump, once a critic of his predecessor’s golfing, has visited one of his golf courses in Florida    seemingly to play the sport    five of the last seven weekends. A president’s golf play is far from controversial: In fact, it’s the most common pastime of the country’s leaders. But before he ran for office, Trump was the most fervent critic of the fact that President Barack Obama regularly hit the links with friends, aides and advisers, arguing that it showed the president was unserious about fixing America’s problems. Now that Trump is President, the comments are coming back to complicate his golf habit. Trump has visited the two courses near his    estate    Trump International Golf Course in West Palm Beach and Trump National Golf Course in Jupiter    10 times in the first two months of his presidency. ARCHIVES: Rory McIlroy: Golf round with Trump ’not an endorsement’Trump’s top aides would rather obscure that fact, especially considering the President’s past comments about the sport and the White House. ”I’m going to be working for you I’m not going to have time to go play golf,” Trump said during a 2016 event in Virginia.  For the most part, aides have declined to confirm that Trump was playing golf on weekends in Florida, instead repeatedly telling reporters that the President ”may” hit a few balls at his course but that they didn’t know for sure. On multiple occasions, though, Trump’s games have been made public. CNN has seen Trump golfing    driving up the 12th hole on his championship course at Trump International Golf Course    multiple times during the former reality star’s first two months in office. Asked about playing golf before Air Force One took off from Florida, Trump said he played ”very little” over the weekend. It has also been revealed    through golf blogs and media reports    that Trump has played with top professional golfers such as Rory McIlroy, one of the   golfers in the world. While hosting Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in Palm Beach last month, Trump also played a full round with the foreign leader and professional golfer Ernie Els. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer defended Trump’s golfing habit by citing the one day he hosted the Japanese leader, arguing that Trump utilized golf to ”foster deeper relations.” ”How you use the game of golf is something that he has talked about,” Spicer said. During his presidency Obama also golfed with foreign leaders, including Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, British Prime Minister David Cameron and New Zealand Prime Minister John Key. Trump’s preferred course by far is the one closest to his Florida home: Trump International Golf Club. He has visited the course all 10 times he has golfed since becoming President. Only one time    while hosting Abe    did the President also visit Trump National Golf Club in Jupiter. Trump also visited his course in Sterling, Virginia, on March 11 for a meeting. It is unclear whether he played. Trump made critiquing Obama for golfing a part of his 2016 message. ”I love golf, I think it’s one of the greats, but I don’t have time,”    Trump said during a December 2016 rally in Michigan. ”He played more golf last year than Tiger Woods. We don’t have time for this. We don’t have time for this. We have to work.” And before he ran for president, Trump would tweet about Obama’s golfing. ”Can you believe that, with all of the problems and difficulties facing the US, President Obama spent the day playing golf,” Trump tweeted in October 2014. ”Worse than Carter.” Now, citing the President’s privacy, Trump’s aides are left trying to conceal the President’s frequent golfing. This story has been updated."
Gallup: Trump job approval drops to 37%,CNN,Eugene Scott,2017-03-20," (CNN) President Donald Trump’s job approval rating has dropped to 37% while 58% of Americans disapprove of his performance so far as president, new Gallup figures show. The approval ratings, Trump’s worst since taking office two months ago, come as FBI Director James Comey is expected to tell lawmakers that there is no evidence for the President’s unverified claim that former President Barack Obama wiretapped Trump Tower during the election. Trump’s approval rating hovered in the    40s in the weeks following the beginning of his presidency. Aside from the controversy over Trump’s wiretapping claim, the latest poll numbers suggest growing dissatisfaction with his performance following the chaotic rollout of Republicans’ plan to replace the Affordable Care Act and reaction to his travel ban that has faced stiff legal opposition. Gallup tracks daily the percentage of Americans who approve or disapprove of Trump’s job performance. The daily results are based on telephone interviews with about 1, 500 national adults and have a margin of error of 3 percentage points."
"China’s Xi, Tillerson meet as North Korea tests rocket engine",CNN,Steven Jiang,2017-03-19,"Beijing  (CNN) North Korea marked the final day of US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson’s Asia visit Sunday by claiming to have tested a new type of rocket engine, underlining the country’s defiance of recent calls for calm on the Korean Peninsula. The test came hours before Tillerson met Chinese President Xi Jinping, the   meeting between an American official and a Chinese leader since US President Donald Trump took power in January. Xi told Tillerson that there are far more shared interests between the two countries than disputes, emphasizing the need for more communication and coordination on matters involving ”regional hotspots,” according to a statement released by the Chinese foreign ministry. On Sunday, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un oversaw the successful test of a   engine,   Korean Central News Agency reported, saying the event had ”historic significance” that could lead to the ”new birth” of the country’s indigenous rocket industry. Trump said Sunday that he’d ”had meetings on North Korea,” and without mentioning North Korean leader by name said ”He is acting very very badly. I will tell you he is acting very badly.”   Tillerson in Asia  Beijing was Tillerson’s final stop on his first official trip to Asia, which also included visits to Japan and South Korea.  The trip followed a string of North Korean missile launches, which escalated tensions on the Korean Peninsula and came amid fears Pyongyang is preparing for another nuclear test. Despite earlier warning that all options    including military action    remained on the table in dealing with Pyongyang, Tillerson refrained from the harsh language that he had used in Tokyo and Seoul upon arriving in Beijing. Xi and Tillerson leaders met for 30 minutes at the Great Hall of the People, a statement from State Department spokesman Mark Toner said.  The men ”agreed there are opportunities for greater cooperation between China and the United States, but acknowledged there are, and will be in the future, differences between the two countries,” the statement said. It added that Tillerson said Trump is ”anticipating the two will soon be able to meet face to face for discussions that will chart the course for future   relations.” North Korea’s only ally, China is Pyongyang’s only major global ally, with bilateral trade accounting for 70% of North Korea’s total trade, providing a political and economic lifeline to Kim’s increasingly isolated regime. Trump has repeatedly called on Beijing to use its leverage over its unpredictable neighbor.  He singled out China again Friday, tweeting, ”North Korea is behaving very badly. They have been ’playing’ the United States for years. China has done little to help!” After meeting his Chinese counterpart, Foreign Minster Wang Yi, on Saturday, Tillerson stressed ”renewed determination” by Beijing and Washington to ”work together to convince the North Korean government to choose a better path and a different future for its people,” without giving details. Although neither side brought up the subject publicly, Tillerson had been expected to raise the prospect of financial penalties on Chinese companies and banks that do business with North Korea. ”The Trump administration is banking that threats of US military action in South Korea and tougher sanctions on Chinese entities will intimidate Beijing into changing its policies,” said Ashley Townshend, a research fellow at the United States Studies Center at the University of Sydney. On the trip, Tillerson has signaled a new approach toward North Korea, saying that Washington’s policy of ”strategic patience” over the past 20 years aimed at halting North Korea’s nuclear development was a failure. Between the US and North Korea, Beijing, however, has been irked by calls that it isn’t doing enough to lessen tensions in the region. Wang said China had made ”important contributions” to supporting US engagement with Pyongyang but stressed it was, at its core, an issue between the United States and North Korea. An   opinion piece Friday in the Global Times, a Chinese   tabloid, made a similar point. ”Washington and Seoul are trying to shift all the burden of solving the North Korean nuclear issue onto China and include China into their strategy toward Pyongyang,” it said. ”But that way, China and North Korea will become enemies, further complicating the conflict. The North Korean nuclear issue is caused by   confrontation, to which China has no obligation to shoulder all the responsibilities.” Wang reiterated the Chinese position that the United States should ”come back to the right track of a negotiated settlement.”  He also said he hoped Washington would examine Beijing’s plans to defuse tensions, although Tillerson has already dismissed the proposal the United States should drop joint military exercises with South Korea as a show of good faith to Pyongyang. Tillerson said Friday that Washington did ”not believe that conditions are right to engage in any talks at this time.”  However, he left the door open Saturday, saying he would work with China to ”bring North Korea to a different place where we are hopeful we can begin a dialogue.” Trump and Xi to meet?  Tillerson was also in Beijing to iron out the details of a tentative summit between Presidents Trump and Xi in Florida in April. It would be the first meeting between the two men, whose interactions would affect what many consider the world’s most important diplomatic relationship. The Chinese foreign ministry statement quoted Tillerson as saying that Trump expected the two leaders to meet ”as soon as possible” but did not confirm the April summit. Xi also invited Trump to visit China, it added. Despite fiery rhetoric on the campaign trail and prior to his inauguration, Trump and his administration have taken a relatively   approach to China so far. Trump has not followed through on campaign threats to label China a currency manipulator or impose steep tariffs on Chinese imports.  He also endorsed the ”One China” policy, which has governed delicate relations between the United States, China and Taiwan for decades    after questioning its legitimacy shortly after his election."
Nadia Murad and Amal Clooney demand justice for Yazidis,CNN, Alexandra King,2017-03-19," (CNN) A Yazidi woman who was kidnapped and taken as a sex slave by ISIS told CNN’s Fareed Zakaria on Sunday that the Iraqi government and the UN should establish an investigation in order to bring members of the brutal regime to justice.  Nadia Murad, along with her counsel, international human rights lawyer Amal Clooney, described her ordeal to Zakaria. It began in 2014 after ISIS militants arrived at her village in Sinjar, Kurdistan, she said.  ”Early morning on August 3, 2014, they attacked us,” she recalled. ”Nearly 6, 500 women and children from the Yazidi were abducted and about 5, 000 people from the community were killed during that day. For eight months, they separated us from our mothers and our sisters and our brothers, and some of them were killed and others disappeared.”  Murad’s mother and six of her brothers and stepbrothers were executed. Murad, along with other unmarried women, was taken as a sex slave and passed around various ISIS militants.  At one point, she told the UN Security Council in 2015, as punishment for a failed escape attempt, she was gang raped until she passed out. All of this, she said, was considered legal under ISIS rule    which dictates that Yazidis, because they do not practice Islam, can be taken as slaves on religious grounds. ”They sold girls, girls that were underage, because ISIS considered that permissible under Islamic law,” Murad said. ”They came not just to attack certain people, but they came for all Yazidis.” The violence against the Yazidi community continues to this day, said Clooney, who represents Murad. Around 3, 000 Yazidis are believed to remain in captivity, some of them from Murad’s own family. It’s time, Clooney said, to bring ISIS to justice for committing some of ”the worst crimes of our generation.” ”We know that there’s a military campaign going on where ISIS is being taken on on the battlefield. What we want is to see ISIS members also in a courtroom,” Clooney said. No court has attempted to prosecute ISIS, There hasn’t been a ”single prosecution against ISIS in a court anywhere in the world for the crimes committed against the Yazidis . .. for any international crimes,” she added.  Last week, Clooney addressed the UN in a bid to convince the Security Council to set up an investigation in Iraq to start collecting evidence. ”ISIS is not a local threat, it’s a global threat,” Clooney said. ”So, my message to the UN was, this is a global threat. It needs a global response. And part of that response must be a judicial one. It cannot be only on the battlefield. You can’t defeat ISIS on the battlefield alone, because you have to also deal with future recruiting. And I think trials and exposing the brutality of ISIS and trying to make a dent in some of their shiny propaganda by showing that it’s not a holy war and showing what they’re really doing to children, to women, is one way to help that,” she said. Clooney believes an investigation also is crucial to ensure that evidence is properly collected. ”ISIS has set up a whole bureaucracy involving the slave trade where they’ve set up committees, they’ve set up courts, so there are documents, there’s DNA, there are mass graves, and nobody is actually collecting this evidence. And if it gets lost, it means we can never have trials and we can never have justice,” she said. Clooney: There is a resolution ’drafted and ready’ Clooney said she is asking the Iraqi government and the UN to step in and set up  a thorough investigation. In order to make that happen, she said, Iraq needed only to send a letter to the Security Council saying, ”Please establish an investigation.” ”There’s already a resolution drafted and ready,” she said, ”And if Iraq just sends the letter, then there will be a vote. And from all of my conversations, including with the Russian ambassador and the United States ambassador and others, it seems that there’s actually broad support in the Council.  ”So, this actually should move forward. It’s in line with the Iraqi government’s interests, because they’re going after ISIS.” Murad, who now lives in Germany, said she hoped ISIS would finally be brought to justice. Then, she said, switching from her native language to a halting English, she ”wondered,” that ”maybe if I can speak English, maybe the UN, they can understand . .. what we want. But I can’t.” ”We can hear you no matter what language you speak,”  said Zakaria. "
"Football greats Dwight Clark, Gale Sayers battle brain diseases",CNN,,2017-03-20," (CNN) Dwight Clark and Gale Sayers are both NFL legends, and their struggles with brain disease were revealed this week. In an open letter on his website, San Francisco 49ers legend Clark announced that he has amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The neurodegenerative disease    also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease    disrupts the connection between the brain and the muscles and can eventually leave sufferers paralyzed but with brain function, or ”locked in.” Some experts have hypothesized that the condition may be due to exposure to repeated head trauma.  In his letter, Clark said that he had constant pain in his neck since his football days and in September 2015 developed weakness in his left hand. Months later, he was diagnosed with ALS. ”While I’m still trying to wrap my head around the challenge I will face with this disease over the coming years, the only thing I know is that I’m going to fight like hell and live every day to the fullest,” Clark wrote. ”In addition to losing strength in my left hand    which makes opening a pack of sugar or buttoning my shirt impossible    I have now experienced weakness in my right hand, abs, lower back and right leg. I can’t run, play golf or walk any distances. Picking up anything over 30 pounds is a chore. The one piece of good news is that the disease seems to be progressing more slowly than in some patients,” he said. Clark played as a wide receiver for the 49ers from 1979 to 1987. He is best remembered for ”The Catch” in the 1982 NFC playoffs, which took the 49ers to victory against the Dallas Cowboys in the final minute of play.   Sayers’ struggle, Research suggests that professional football players are four times more likely to have ALS and three times more likely to die from neurodegenerative diseases like ALS or Alzheimer’s than the general population.  In a recent interview with the Kansas City Star, Ardie Sayers, wife of former Chicago Bears great Gale Sayers, opened up about her husband’s dementia. Sayers, the ”Kansas Comet,” was the youngest person to be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, at the age of 34 in 1977.  Although he was diagnosed just four years ago, Ardie believes the disease began surfacing as far back as 2009.  Sayers’ story was immortalized in the 1971 movie ”Brian’s Song,” starring Billy Dee WIlliams as Sayers and James Caan as Brian Piccolo, which told about the friendship they developed as they became the first interracial NFL roommates while competing for a spot with the Bears.  Today, his wife says,    Sayers is healthy ”as a horse” and works out with a trainer several days week, but mentally, he is not as strong. He has a hard time holding a conversation, and she said he had recently washed his hands with carpet cleaner.  It is not known whether Sayers’ condition is directly a result of his football career, but his wife says doctors have no questions about whether it is a factor.  ’A part of this has to be on football’ ”Like the doctor at the Mayo Clinic said, ’Yes, a part of this has to be on football,’ ” Ardie Sayers told the Kansas City Star. ”It wasn’t so much getting hit in the head. . .. It’s just the shaking of the brain when they took him down with the force they play the game in.” Much of the concern about repetitive hits has been over their link to the neurodegenerative disease called chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Some experts have posited that it can prompt the development of other diseases, such as ALS, as was the case with former Philadelphia Eagles player Kevin Turner.   In November, doctors said that Turner had CTE when he died and that it had brought on his ALS. Turner joined a roster of former football players diagnosed with CTE, including Frank Gifford, Junior Seau and Dave Duerson.  Despite the fact that Hall of Famer Mike Webster had the first case of CTE diagnosed in a professional football player in 2002, it was not until March 2016 that the NFL publicly acknowledged a connection between the sport and brain disease.   In his new letter, Clark says, ”I’ve been asked if playing football caused this. I don’t know for sure. But I certainly suspect it did. And I encourage the NFLPA and the NFL to continue working together in their efforts to make the game of football safer, especially as it relates to head trauma.” In 2012, 80   lawsuits on behalf of more than 2, 000 NFL players were combined and filed as a single   lawsuit in federal court. The players accused the NFL not only of negligence but of failing to notify them of the link between concussions and brain injuries. Turner was a lead plaintiff on the complaint.  Three years later, a federal judge gave final approval to a settlement. By this time, over 5, 000 former NFL players had filed suit and were eligible for the settlement. This agreement provided up to $5 million per retired player for serious medical conditions associated with repeated head trauma. The deal also called for baseline medical exams for retired NFL players and monetary awards for those who are diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s disease, dementia, ALS and certain cases of CTE. Hope for a cure, Clark’s letter focuses on fighting the disease and the support provided to him by his family, friends and former 49ers teammates. ”Every single one of my 49ers teammates that has contacted me has said whatever I need, anytime I need it, they will help. That’s just the kind of guys they are. They were so giving as players and now they are the same as friends,” he said. ”I’m not having a press conference or doing any interviews. That time will come. Right now, I’ve got work to do. I’ve got to devote all my energy preparing for this battle and I would hope you can respect my family’s privacy as I begin this challenge. My ultimate hope is that eventually I can assist in finding a cure for ALS, which disrupts the lives of so many and their loved ones.” Like Clark, Ardie Sayers is focused on the future    not just of her husband but of others like him.  ”It’s hard, yes, I’m not saying it isn’t. And it’s challenging at times,” she said. ”But then when I stop and think about the people around me and people that are willing to help and family that are willing to come . .. we’re blessed that way.”"
"Gorsuch touts family, roots while Democrats revisit Garland snub",CNN,Ariane de Vogue,2017-03-20,"Washington (CNN) After more than three hours of listening, Judge Neil Gorsuch finally spoke up at his own confirmation hearing sending a message of unity despite the fraught atmosphere surrounding his nomination.  ”Long before we are Republicans or Democrats    we are Americans,” the    federal judge said.  Monday was the first day of four hearings on Gorsuch a federal appeals court judge from Colorado, likely to carry on the conservative legacy of the late Justice Antonin Scalia and be an early   win for President Donald Trump. It was also a setting for Democrats to revisit their feelings about the snub last year of President Barack Obama’s nominee, Judge Merrick Garland. Acknowledging the political nature of his nomination and confirmation hearings, Gorsuch pushed back at those who describe judges as ”politicians in robes.”  ”I have watched my colleagues spend long days worrying over cases,” he said. ”Sometimes the answers follow us home and keep us up at night.” Without mentioning Trump’s recent attacks on judges, he praised his bretheren.  ”I want to thank my fellow judges across the country. Judging is sometimes a lonely and hard job. But I have seen how these men and women work with courage and collegiality, independence and integrity. Their work helps make the promises of our Constitution and laws real for us all.” Gorsuch also stressed the limited role of the judge. ”I am humbled to he here,” he said. ”Ours is a judiciary of honest black polyester.” And he stressed that people often overlook that judges are often unanimous. ”I wonder if people realize that Justices (Clarence) Thomas and (Sonia) Sotomayor agree about 60% of the time, or that Justices Scalia and (Stephen) Breyer agreed even more often than that,” he said. Democrats not over Garland snub, Gorsuch’s statement came after four hours of speeches from senators, and repeated cries from Democrats angry about what happened    or didn’t happen    last year after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. Sen. Patrick Leahy called it an ”extraordinary blockade” that was ”totally unprecedented in our country’s whole history.”  Leahy criticized Trump for relying on conservative groups like the Heritage Foundation and Federalist Society last year to vet and recommend his list of potential Supreme Court picks. ”Senate Republicans made a big show last year about respecting the voice of the American people in this process,” he said, referring to Trump’s election victory. ”Now they’re arguing that the Senate should   their nominees selected by extreme interest groups and nominated by a president who lost the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes.” Texas GOP Sen. Ted Cruz responded later by saying in essence: We won. Cruz sharply defended Republicans’ decision to hold the seat vacant, saying the presidential  election was also a ”referendum on the kind of justice that should replace Justice Scalia.”    ”Given the engagement of the electorate nationally on this central issue, I would suggest that Judge Gorsuch is no ordinary nominee,” Cruz said.  ”Because of this unique and transparent process    unprecedented in the nation’s history    his nomination carries with it a super legitimacy,” he continued. ”The American people played a very direct role in helping choose this nominee.” Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin said the actions blocking Garland and subsequent Gorsuch nomination ”is part of a Republican strategy to capture our judicial branch of government. That is why the Senate Republicans kept the Supreme Court seat vacant for more than a year and why they left 30 judicial nominees who had received bipartisan approval of this committee to die on the Senate calendar as President Obama left office.” Leahy said the GOP is conducting ”court unpacking scheme,” harkening back to President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s failed effort in the 1930s to pack the Supreme Court with more justices, a move lawmakers rejected. ”Remember the Judiciary Committee once stood against a   scheme of a Democratic president that would have eroded judicial independence, and that was a proud moment,” Leahy said. ”Now Republicans on this committee are guilty of their own   scheme.” Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley,   used his opening statement to decry ”executive overreach” and expressed ”alarm” over ”the threat it poses to the separation of powers.” Discussing the need for an independent jurist, Grassley said, ”Good judges understand this.  They know it isn’t their job to fix the law. In a democracy, that right belongs to be the people.” Democrats going after Gorsuch dissents, Trump policies, Democrats will also use the hearing to go after Trump’s early actions such as his travel ban for people from seven    then revised to six      countries, which has been blocked by federal courts from coast to coast. The question, California Sen. Dianne Feinstein said of Gorsuch, is ”whether he will protect the legal and constitutional rights of all Americans.” ”President Trump repeatedly promised to appoint someone in the mold of Justice Scalia,” she said, ”and that the nomination of Judge Gorsuch illustrates that he is a man of his word. For those of us on this side, our job is not to theoretically evaluate this or that legal doctrine, or to review Judge Gorsuch’s record in a vacuum. Our job is to determine whether Judge Gorsuch is a reasonable mainstream conservative or is he not.” Praising his mentors, Turning to his own inspirations, Gorsuch praised his wife Louise and then stopped —  mid statement    to hug her. His voice cracked as he talked about an uncle he had just lost. Of his former boss, Justice Anthony Kennedy, Gorsuch said, ”he showed me that judges can disagree without being disagreeable.” And he joked that Scalia, his ideological ally, and sometimes fishing partner was a mentor too. ”The justice fished with the enthusiasm of a New Yorker. He thought the harder you slapped the line on the water, somehow the more the fish would love it. ” In citing Justice Byron White, Gorsuch noted his history as an NFL player. And he name checked two former Broncos of more recent vintage. ”In Colorado today, there is God and John Elway and Peyton Manning. In my childhood it was God and Byron White,” Gorsuch said. Elway, as it happens, sent a letter to the Senate endorsing Gorsuch Monday. Under the radar, Gorsuch’s nomination has flown under the radar in Washington as the focus has been on the litany of Trump actions such as the travel ban, budget proposal that would cut billions of dollars from agencies, executive orders and claims about Obama wiretapping Trump Tower. At the same time, Republicans are pushing through legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare. About a dozen people in the audience are wearing red ”stop Gorsuch” shirts. Colorado’s two senators introduced Gorsuch, as did Neal Katyal    a former Obama acting solicitor general. He will face questions from senators Tuesday.  Grassley announced he expects a committee vote on Gorsuch’s nomination on April 3. "
Tom Brady’s stolen Super Bowl jerseys recovered,CNN,Jill Martin,2017-03-20,"Mexico City (CNN) Tom Brady’s missing Super Bowl jerseys have been found. The jersey worn last month by the New England Patriots’ quarterback during Super Bowl LI in Houston was recovered at the home of a former newspaper editor, Mexico’s National Security Commission told CNN on  Monday. Mexico’s federal police and the FBI conducted a raid at the home of La Prensa director Mauricio Ortega on March 12, according to the commission. Ortega resigned two days later for ”personal reasons,” the tabloid said in a statement. The investigation also netted the jersey Brady wore in 2015 when the Patriots defeated the Seattle Seahawks in Super Bowl XLIX, the NFL said. That game was played at University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Arizona. The NFL issued a statement saying the ”items were found in the possession of a credentialed member of the international media.” Brady noticed his number 12 jersey missing from his bag in the locker room at NRG Stadium in Houston following the Patriots’ February 5 win over the Atlanta Falcons. The jersey is valued at $500, 000, according to Houston police. Mexican authorities said they will not charge Ortega because the alleged crime occurred in the United States. Earlier Monday, Houston authorities said charges probably will be brought.  CNN was attempting to obtain comment from Ortega.  At a press conference in Houston, Houston police Chief Art Acevedo said the jersey Brady wore in Houston is now in Boston and in the care of the NFL and FBI. Tests are ongoing to verify the authentication of the jerseys. ”We’re highly confident that these are in fact the jerseys, based on investigative efforts and based on all the information that these fine men and women of our police department uncovered,” Acevedo said. Acevedo said police received a tip from an informant in Houston that led investigators to Mexico. In conjunction with FBI and Mexican authorities, they went to the suspect’s known address and found the two jerseys. Acevedo said he expected charges to be filed. He didn’t name the suspect but said he didn’t live in Houston. Acevedo said that while this case was not a priority, this was the ”only blemish” on the Houston Police Department on the Super Bowl. ”You don’t come to Texas and embarrass us here on our home turf,” he said. And there may be more.  According to the NFL, a Denver Broncos’ helmet was retrieved as part of the ongoing investigation. The Broncos defeated the Carolina Panthers in Super Bowl 50 at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, California, in February 2016, and the helmet of Broncos outside linebacker Von Miller, who was named Super Bowl MVP, went missing. ”We have been in contact with NFL Security regarding a Denver Broncos helmet that could potentially belong to Von Miller,” Broncos spokesman Patrick Smyth told CNN. ”As this is an ongoing investigation, we will defer all other comment and inquiries to the NFL.” When asked about the Broncos’ memorabilia, Acevedo said he was not aware of that. The NFL referred additional questions to the FBI, citing the ongoing investigation. The FBI is not commenting, citing the ongoing investigation. Brady issued this statement through his agent, Don Yee: ”I am happy my jerseys from SB 49 and SB 51 have been recovered, and I want to thank all of the law enforcement agencies involved.  I know they worked hard on this case    and it is very much appreciated. Hopefully when I get the jerseys back I can make something very positive come from this experience.” Brady is the first quarterback to win five Super Bowl titles. He was named Super Bowl MVP for the fourth time, the most all time, in his victory over the Falcons."
Neil deGrasse Tyson goes supernova on Trump budget,CNN,Eugene Scott,2017-03-20," (CNN) Astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson believes President Donald Trump’s first proposed budget could make America ”weak,” ”sick” and ”stupid.” ”The fastest way to Make America Weak Again: Cut science funds to our agencies that support it,” he tweeted Sunday as part of a social media rampage against the President. ”The fastest way to Make America Sick Again: Cut funding to the National Institutes of Health.” ”The fastest way to Make America Stupid: Cut funds to programs that support education,” Tyson added. ”The fastest way to thwart Earth’s   systems for us all: Turn EPA into EDA  —   the Environmental Destruction Agency.” CNN has reached out to the White House for response. In his first budget blueprint, the President proposed $54 billion in cuts to large parts of the federal government and popular programs big and small. Trump’s budget would cut off funding entirely for several agencies, including arts, public broadcasting and development groups, and also proposes steep cuts to agencies like the State Department and Environmental Protection Agency. Nearly every agency will see some sort of cut, with only Defense, Homeland Security and Veterans Affairs getting a boost.  Here’s what Trump’s budget proposes to cut, ”We can all imagine a land that provides no support for Art. But is that a place you’d want to Live? To Visit? To Play,” Tyson tweeted. ”We all want to Make America Great Again. But that won’t happen until we first Make America Smart Again,” he added."
Why this Persian New Year is different,CNN,,2017-03-20," (CNN) March 2017 is the first March of my life that I’ve had to be reminded of Persian New Year.  It happened at my local dog park in Harlem, on an unseasonably hot day, as my standard poodle buddied up to an old Siberian husky. The owner and I broke into the usual  . Dog names first, then ours. I said my name slowly, though it came out softer than I hoped, and I searched the woman’s eyes    something I have caught myself doing again recently, decades since my early days of refugee anxiety, when I’d first come to America with my family on political asylum from Iran.  She didn’t blink. Instead, she said, ”Beautiful name, what is it?” I’d heard that sentence my whole life, so I blurted it out with rehearsed confidence: ”Iranian.” Between us, a mess of ellipses, the sound of basketballs on courts, some distant siren, a tangle of dog barks. Then another classic: ”What does it mean?” And my usual: ”It’s an ancient Zoroastrian name, an unusual one for Iranians.”  I thought to explain that I’m of Muslim background, but instead I just hoped for the awkward parting of people whose only connection is canines. She looked deep in thought and I thought maybe she felt sorry for me    Iranian in a time of Trump’s Muslim Ban, after all    but maybe she felt her own discomfort. She cut into my ruminations with a question I didn’t expect: ”Isn’t your New Year coming soon?” Her knowledge was surprising, but I was astounded more than anything by the realization that I’d forgotten this holiday of holidays, on Monday this year. I gave the stranger a flustered ”thank you.”  By the time I got back to my apartment I was deep in that complicated cold sweat I used to know well.   How did that stranger know that? Why did she want to talk to me? What did that stranger really think? A pause. What exactly am I afraid of today? A time of beauty, hope and optimism, Persian New Year, or Nowruz, is a celebration of spring. It falls at the time of the vernal equinox (which shifts in accordance with axial precession). Weeks before it happens, every Iranian I know excitedly looks up the time online and plans a day around it. This is not a holiday we take lightly. The celebration is many thousands of years old with roots in ancient   culture, a religion some say the prophet Zoroaster himself created. Meaning ”new day,” its spiritual origin has extended to secular appreciation by all sorts of people who can claim some ancient Persian origin, including, of course,   Iranians. These days, many Instagram accounts all over the world have turned Nowruz traditions into cult obsessions. Nothing makes for a good photo like the   ”haftsin,” an arrangement of seven foods beginning with S: sprouts (”sabzeh”) wheat pudding (”samanu”) dried oleaster (”senjed”) garlic (”sir”) apples (”sib”) vinegar (”serkeh”) and sumac fruit (”sumac”). All this is skirted with spring paraphernalia like candies, eggs, mirrors, flowers and even goldfish. One could argue Iranians worship beauty even more than Americans, and it’s never more apparent than in Nowruz aesthetics.  My favorite memories of Nowruz involve me trying to derail my mother’s efforts in beautifying our Nowruz best she could. The profound mischief of altering the haftsin without my parents noticing was a great goal of mine —  one time, at age 6 or 7, I tried to drown a hairless Barbie in the goldfish bowl. Often I’d try to pollute the immaculate individual haftsin bowls with Cheerios and MMs, anything obviously American.   But I also relished all the cultural ”abnormalities” that could feel like American transgressions    for instance, my parents waking us up in the middle of the night on a school night to celebrate ”tahvileh sal,” the exact moment of equinox, a given ritual no matter what horrible hour it came.  We grew up with few luxuries, so I usually felt so excited that Nowruz was also a time of treats. All Nowruz’s symbolic purification talk was exciting for me as it meant we were to wear new clothes that day    and that meant a mall visit, during which I could make a case for some impractical Wet Seal creation (”We have to do it for Persia!” I’d cry, waving some lacy tube top on sale).  And all sorts of   foods entered our lives then and only then too. The Persian cookies (walnut, chickpea, almond, rice) from the Persian grocery stores in LA’s ”Little Persia” were my favorite. Later, in college, my parents sent care packages full of them and I boasted to friends that these were Persian comfort foods. Most of all, in my youth I believed Nowruz might have the power to eclipse the other darknesses of my homeland that played nonstop on television and in the news. I hoped the imagery of beauty and hope and optimism could mean something more: maybe Americans could see themselves in it all. Family old and new, This year, Nowruz falls at half past six in morning for me. I’ve never been the best early riser but I know the hour well these days since the election, my nights are a mess of   insomnia keeping me up close to dawn. Then, early in the morning, my dog has taken to waking me up with a sermon of barks    something he never did before. I soon realize my       Harlem building has had its share of early morning visitors in uniform. Different neighbors give me different numbers on our building’s deportations, while another neighbor tells me not to talk about any of this. My building happens to be mostly Muslim    brown, black, and white Muslim    and is located close to several prominent mosques, one of the reasons I’ve loved living here. But in the hallway my neighbors and I wonder what others are saying. In hushed tones we curse the casual and constant bigotry of this administration, just as we beg each other to take good care. We residents have become closer since the Paris Attacks last year, when police presence in this neighborhood ramped up noticeably. Before that, many of us didn’t know where we stood, who we were    you can’t always tell who is Muslim, after all. None of our names sounded it, none of us fit that profile Islamophobes have    the maintenance guy from Montenegro, the waitress of Lebanese origin, the Turkish couple, the Egyptian siblings, the old black Muslim families who’ve been in Harlem for decades, the other Iranian woman who is a student where I teach. And of course, me, who passes for everything, with the additional complication of a Zoroastrian name. For the last few years, I’ve been joking I’m a Secret Muslim. Iranian nationalism and exceptionalism always steered my father    the man who named me ”Porochista,” after Zoroaster’s daugher    far away from discussions of Islam. Nowruz was always a time for my father to wave his Iranian flag (the one with the lion and sword, not the Islamic Republic one) to   and frame Persepolis photos from library books, to present me and my brother with fake gold   pins. ”The great Persian empire!” he’d cry in our tiny moldy apartment with the decaying carpet, surrounded by   neighbors. That same father took us to Zoroastrian temples in Orange County for years. I never understood why we got such dirty looks until I was past my teens and realized we’d only been religious tourists at their temple. We were never Zoroastrian, and we couldn’t be. The religion was dying    some say less than 150, 000 remain    because you have to be born into it. Still, its old traditions, like Nowruz, have retained their influence in cultures of the region. Muslim Iranians tend to look to Zoroastrianism with pride.  But when my father sought to gild my identity with a Zoroastrian name, it wasn’t out of simple pride it took me years to realize that maybe he thought it was protection from all sorts of futures. When he’d hush my late grandmother as she recited Quran verses in public, maybe it wasn’t out of shame for his actual cultural origins    maybe he just didn’t trust Americans to hear it. Just as I try to let go of Nowruz, it comes, This year, once Nowruz announced itself to me, I wanted to forget it. Even in my circle of Iranian friends in New York I hear us beginning to plan but thinking twice in a way we never did before. ”Not in the mood,” one friend tells me. ”Not in the mood,” I tell another friend. And I think about how my parents and I are barely in contact right now    all of us locked in our own suffering, fear not bringing us together at all.   Naturalized at 23, I think about how my birthplace is still on that passport, in those bold letters: Iran. I think about my father back home in LA with only a green card. I think about all the old traumas (the racial slurs my family and I endured when we first came to this country in the early 1980s) and the usual traumas (all the times I’ve been pulled aside at airports) and the new waves of traumas (daily online harassment, like the time the poet on Facebook, friends with 222 of mine, told me to ”go back to whatever Third World shithole you come from”). I try to imagine skipping Nowruz altogether I try to imagine giving in to grief as an opportunity to meditate on the horrors of this era. But it’s hard to commit to even a lack of commitment these days, not knowing what will happen next.  Just as I try to let go of Nowruz, it comes for me. It starts when a neighbor’s card appears by my door: ”Happy 1396, we are with you,” it says in cursive. Later I find myself scrolling through the Instagram accounts of families in Tehran and I marvel at their haftsin skills, and catch myself dreaming of a   gathering.  At the dog park, still covered in March snow, the old stranger with the husky appears again, and we chat about the promise of new blooms, our worries of climate change, the complications that separate and connect us. Happy New Year, we say to each other, Nowruz Mobarak. She reveals to me she taught in Iran long ago, and I realize she knows the hospital where I was born and has been to my mother’s hometown, that she remembers skiing on a day like this in our mountains. We walk together and laugh at how our dogs can’t stop licking the mounds of gray city ice that have a way to go until they are gone, but finally show signs of melting.  Nowruz is here, Nowruz has come. You can only stop a New Day so much."

Freak accident at Ghana waterfall kills 18,CNN,Lauren Said-Moorhouse,2017-03-20," (CNN) A freak accident at a popular waterfall in Ghana has killed at least 18 people, according to local authorities.  A huge tree appears to have fallen amid a brutal storm trapping swimmers at the base of Kintampo waterfalls in the country’s Brong Ahafo region on Sunday afternoon, Kintampo District Police commander chief Desmond Owusu Boampong told CNN. 14 students from Wenchi Methodist Senior High School in Ghana are among the 18 people killed, Boampong added. The students were on an excursion to the popular spot at the time of the incident, another police spokesperson said.  Authorities said a further 22 individuals are currently being treated at a local hospital for injuries sustained in the accident.  Emergency teams    comprised of both local Ghana police and the Ghana National Fire Service    responded to the scene shortly after to rescue the trapped victims and aid the injured.  Eyewitnesses told local police that the incident happened around 4 p. m. (12 p. m. ET) during a severe rainstorm which caused three large trees to fall to the ground.  Ghanaian President Nana   has offered his condolences on Twitter. ”I have learned with great sadness, the unfortunate incident that occurred at Kintampo Waterfalls yesterday. ( )” Following up with a second post, he added: ”My deepest condolences to the families of all those affected by this unfortunate and tragic incident. ( )” Meanwhile the Ministry Of Tourism, Culture and Creative Arts said this morning on   Hitz FM that the minister, Catherine Afeku and her team are en route to the scene to investigate the accident and commiserate with the bereaved families. Kintampo waterfalls    one of the highest in the country    is located in Ghana’s Brong Ahafo region, around 400 kilometers (almost 250 miles) north of the capital, Accra. Situated on the Pumpum River, it is one of the most visited tourist sites in the country. "
Iceland’s secret to happiness? It’s in the water,CNN,,2017-03-20," (CNN) When it comes to socializing, England has its pubs. Italy has its piazzas. And Iceland has its pools. On a snowy February afternoon, the outdoor West End pool in the capital city of Reykjavik was busy. Steam rose off the hot tubs, heated by Iceland’s vast geothermal network. Laughter and chatting filled the air. This is Iceland’s meeting place. And in a country with minimal daylight in the long, gray winter, these pools might be the key to Iceland’s happiness. Iceland’s natural surroundings, though stunning, can be harsh and desolate. Snow, sleet and rain blow wildly in the wind during the winter. The island’s population of 332, 000 people, mostly centered around Reykjavik, hunkers down to wait it out, usually indoors. But if they’re outdoors, you’ll find them in the pools and hot tubs that dot the country nearly every neighborhood has one. Tourists tend to gather at the   Blue Lagoon. If you want to find the locals, you need a neighborhood pool. And this unique culture has drawn interest from researchers at the University of Iceland, including folklorist Valdimar Hafstein. ”At this point, it is considered more or less a civil right to have one (of these pools) within walking distance of your home,” he said. ”It’s become a focus point of public life, really.” Despite the harsh climate, Iceland often finds itself among the top three of the world’s happiest countries. Hafstein and his fellow researchers believe the pools are a big reason why. ”If you think of health and wellness not just as a matter of physical health and being free from disease but also the mental and social aspects, I think the geothermal heat and communal pools have a lot to do with that,” Hafstein said. ”We feel good here. We know our neighbors, because we meet them in the pools. It creates a good vibe, and you feel at home in there.” In the 1950s and ’60s, Iceland switched from   heat to geothermal, harnessing the power of the island’s volcanic activity. The infrastructure created by the switch allowed the formation of communal pools, which have been breaking down social barriers ever since. ”When we meet in the pool, we chat, and that’s a space of liberty where you’re at ease to talk to others,” Hafstein said. ”People from all walks of life go to the pool. So you have, mixing in the same hot tub, people living in the area, whether it’s the professor or the student, construction worker or the businessman, the billionaire or car salesman    they all meet up.” There are some rules to observe. Don’t discuss anything too personal keep it to broader social issues. Don’t shake hands a simple nod will do. And make sure to shower thoroughly before and after getting in the pool. Icelanders take pool hygiene very seriously. Hafstein has his own pool routine. Every Monday morning, he meets his friends at the West End Pool at 7 a. m. before work and the demands of life take over. They sit in one of the hot tubs, snow flurries falling on their heads, and talk about life    an experience as uniquely Iceland as this place and its people."
Paraglider’s near-death experience,CNN,Shasta Darlington,2017-03-20,"Rio de Janeiro (CNN) The last thing Thomas Antalffy remembers is slowly circling towards the ground in the late afternoon at the end of a terrific   paragliding flight in central Brazil. He woke up the next morning covered in blood ”in the middle of the bush.” ”I remember one shoulder hurting, but other than that I didn’t feel any pain. I even took a selfie,” Antalffy  tells CNN.  After all, he had been paragliding off and on for a couple of decades this was just another adventure. So he packed up his parachute and lugged the   bag to the highway, where he flagged someone down and got a ride back to his hotel.  In fact, it was days before he discovered that in the paragliding freefall that he doesn’t even remember, he broke his scapula and numerous vertebrae cracked his skull and blood was pressuring his brain. The    Hungarian entrepreneur had traveled from his home in London with a group of enthusiasts for a   paragliding adventure in Valadares, Brazil, though he says he has very few memories from the first week after the accident on February 23.  READ: Paragliding the Swiss Alps, WATCH: The extreme sport combining paragliding and skiing, Barely conscious, When Antaflffy didn’t return to the hotel that night, his colleagues called the police, but were convinced he only had relatively minor injuries when he walked in the door the next morning.  After a trip to the hospital, which was overrun by a local yellow fever outbreak, Antalffy was sent back to bed at his hotel under heavy sedation. His colleagues planned to take him home on a plane in a few days time. But in fact, the blood was accumulating in his brain and he was barely conscious, Antalffy says. In a daze, he took twice the pills prescribed. His wife Anita Dangel, who had stayed home in London, had been unable to reach him on his phone for two days, and when she finally got through to the hotel and spoke to her husband she knew something was amiss, ”He told me, ’I’m really weak. I had an accident. I’m too weak to come home, please come help,’” she told CNN. ”That was a red light for me. He’s so independent if he can do something on his own, he will.” Miracle, Dangel struggled to reach Valadares    and even then doctors told her they could fly to a bigger hospital in the nearby city of Belo Horizonte. Intuition guided her, and they chose a   ambulance drive instead. ”When we got here and they did a head scan, the doctors told us it was a miracle. He would have died if we had tried to fly with so much pressure on his brain.” More than three weeks later and Antalffy is quickly recovering. They hope to fly home at the end of the month. ”There are things that change your life forever,” Dangel said. ”This is definitely one of them. We will never be the same.”"
How the 1% are preparing for the apocalypse,CNN,,2017-03-20," (CNN) Say ”doomsday bunker” and most people would imagine a concrete room filled with cots and canned goods.  The threat of global annihilation may feel as present as it did during the Cold War, but today’s   shelters could not be more different from their   counterparts.  A number of companies around the world are meeting a growing demand for structures that protect from any risk, whether it’s a global pandemic, an asteroid, or World War III    while also delivering luxurious amenities.  ”Your father or grandfather’s bunker was not very comfortable,” says Robert Vicino, a real estate entrepreneur and CEO of Vivos, a company he founded that builds and manages   shelters around the world.  ”They were gray. They were metal, like a ship or something military. And the truth is mankind cannot survive   in such a Spartan, bleak environment.”  Doomsday demand, Many of the world’s elite, including hedge fund managers, sports stars and tech executives (Bill Gates is rumored to have bunkers at all his properties) have chosen to design their own secret shelters to house their families and staff.  Gary Lynch, general manager of   Rising S Company, says 2016 sales for their custom   underground bunkers grew 700% compared to 2015, while overall sales have grown 300% since the November US presidential election alone.  The company’s plate steel bunkers, which are designed to last for generations, can hold a minimum of one year’s worth of food per resident and withstand earthquakes.  But while some want to bunker down alone, others prefer to ride out the apocalypse in a community setting that offers an experience a bit closer to the real world. Developers of community shelters like these often acquire decommissioned military bunkers and missile silos built by the United States or Soviet governments    sites that would cost hundreds of millions of dollars to build today.  The fortified structures are designed to withstand a nuclear strike and come equipped with power systems, water purification systems, blast valves, and    (NBC) air filtration.  Read: Subterranean secrets: World’s creepiest underground marvels, Most include food supplies for a year or more, and many have hydroponic gardens to supplement the rations. The developers also work to create   communities with a range of skills necessary for   survival, from doctors to teachers. Vicino says Vivos received a flurry of interest in its shelters around the 2016 election from both liberals and conservatives, and completely sold out of spaces in its community shelters in the past few weeks. Designer ark, One of those shelters, Vivos xPoint, is near the Black Hills of South Dakota, and consists of 575 military bunkers that served as an Army Munitions Depot until 1967.  Presently being converted into a facility that will accommodate about 5, 000 people, the interiors of each bunker are outfitted by the owners at a cost of between $25, 000 to $200, 000 each. The price depends on whether they want a minimalist space or a home with   finishes. The compound itself will be equipped with all the comforts of a small town, including a community theater, classrooms, hydroponic gardens, a medical clinic, a spa and a gym.  For clients looking for something further afield and more luxurious, the company also offers Vivos Europa One, billed as a ”modern day Noah’s Ark” in a former Cold   munitions storage facility in Germany.  The structure, which was carved out of solid bedrock, offers 34 private residences, each starting at 2, 500 square feet, with the option to add a second story for a total of 5, 000 square feet.  Read: How Germany’s wartime bunkers are being reborn, The units will be delivered empty and each owner will have the space renovated to suit their own tastes and needs, choosing from options that include screening rooms, private pools and gyms. Vicino compares the individual spaces to underground yachts, and even recommends that owners commission the same builders and designers that worked on their actual vessels.  ”Most of these people have   yachts, so they already have the relationship and they know the taste, fit, and finish that they want,” he explains. The vast complex includes a tram system to transport residents throughout the shelter, where they can visit its restaurants, theater, coffee shops, pool and game areas.  ”We have all the comforts of home, but also the comforts that you expect when you leave your home,” Vicino adds.  Nuclear hardened homes, Developer Larry Hall’s Survival Condo in Kansas utilizes two abandoned Atlas missile silos built by the US Army Corps of Engineers to house warheads during the early 1960s.  ”Our clients are sold on the unique advantage of having a luxury second home that also happens to be a nuclear hardened bunker,” says Hall, who is already starting work on a second Survival Condo in another silo on site.  ”This aspect allows our clients to invest in an appreciating asset as opposed to an expense.”  The Survival Condo has several different layouts, from a      residence to a      penthouse that starts at $4. 5 million.   Read: Three buildings exploring the unseen world, Owners have access to their homes and the facilities at anytime, whether a disaster is imminent or they just want to get away from it all, and the complex features a pool, general store, theater, bar and library.  The condo association sets the rules for the community, and during an emergency, owners would be required to work four hours a day.    luxury, If you prefer to spend the end of days solo, or at least with   family and friends, you may prefer to consider The Oppidum in the Czech Republic, which is being billed as ”the largest billionaire bunker in the world.”  The   facility, once a joint project between the former Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia (now the Czech Republic and Slovakia) was built over 10 years beginning in 1984.  The site now includes both an   estate and a    underground component. While the final product will be built out to the owner’s specifications, the initial renderings include an underground garden, swimming pool, spa, cinema and wine vault.  Read: 2017’s most anticipated new buildings, While many might see the luxury amenities at these facilities as unnecessary, the developers argue that these features are critical to survival.  ”These shelters are   a year or more,” Vicino says. ”It had better be comfortable.” "
Humpback whales are behaving strangely and scientists want to know why,CNN,Madison Park,2017-03-17," (CNN) Humpback whales are suddenly hanging out in massive, densely packed ”super groups” and scientists are trying to figure out why. It’s a curious phenomenon that’s been spotted off the coast of South Africa by researchers and the general public.  Their   spot is far away from where humpback whales usually summer in the Antarctic. The groups swell from 20 to 200 and they are focused on one thing    feeding. ”When you’re in a small boat with 200 humpback whales around you    they’re   animals    and you’ve got whales popping up all around you, it’s a really incredible experience,” lead researcher Ken Findlay told CNN. He and his colleagues from South Africa’s Department of Environmental Affairs believe that these ”super groups” feeding together is a relatively recent behavior, they wrote in PLOS One. They observed the whales lunging, repeatedly diving and letting out the ”pungent ’fishy’ smell of whale blows.” Research cruises observed this behavior in 2011, 2014 and 2015 during the months of October and November, which are   months in South Africa.  The ”super groups” seemed fluid, as some whales joined them but then left. Researchers observed that some whales traveled from afar to join the massive groups. As the New Scientist pointed out, humpback whales aren’t known for being social. They’re usually spotted alone, in pairs or in small groups that don’t stay together long.  ”Reasons for this recent novel behavior pattern remain speculative,” researchers wrote, but it could be due to increasing numbers of humpback whales in the region or the abundance of prey.  But researchers couldn’t identify what kind of prey prompted this massive  . ”There is something a little mysterious about it, but it’s not mysterious that it’s happening, it’s the how it’s happening and the why it’s happening,” Findlay said. ”We need time to unpack those questions.” He said he and fellow researchers plan to publish a series of papers on the phenomenon. ”I’ve been in humpback research since the late 1980s and we’ve never seen anything like this before.” The spotting of so many super groups do mean something exciting for the state of these majestic creatures. ”What we found here is reflective of the abilities of these animals to bounce back from very severe whaling pressure in the last century. Over 200, 000 humpback whales were taken from the Southern hemisphere last century,” Findlay said. ”It absolutely amazed me that 30 to 40 years later, we’ve seen these populations rebounding as they are. That gives me hope. It tells me something about the state of the ocean.”"
Punk rock band Sløtface slams Trump on women’s rights,CNN,Deena Zaru,2017-03-20,"Austin, Texas (CNN) Members of punk rock band Sløtface, who reluctantly changed the spelling of their name from ”Slutface” after social media censorship, said that feminism is not just a women’s issue and now it’s up to men to join the fight, particularly in the age of President Donald Trump. ”Historically, feminism has been the fight for women’s rights. I feel now that applies to men as well,”   Vikingstad said when CNN caught up with the band at the SXSW music festival in Austin, Texas, Saturday. ”It’s about equality and not just the focus on one fight.” SXSW gets political: All eyes on Trump, The foursome is made up of vocalist Haley Shea, bass player Lasse Lokøy, drummer Halvard Skeie Wiencke and guitarist Vikingstad, who all started out as friends in high school. They blend hardcore rock with a more   sound, and many of their songs channel the feminist narrative and tell stories from a female perspective. ”We wrote more songs that had an explicit feminist manifesto about trying to depict women that were really strong and show that there was a different way to be a woman in music,” Shea said, adding that the band feels passionate about speaking out against sexual harassment that is ”often brushed off” by society.  ”With Trump in office, it’s really important to keep the fight for women’s rights more active than anything right now because we don’t want to take a step back,” Lokøy said. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. The band took issue with comments made by Trump in the infamous 2005 ”Access Hollywood” tape that surfaced last October, where Trump boasted about being able to sexually assault women because of his celebrity. Trump issued an apology, saying the words ”don’t reflect who I am,” but also defended his lewd and sexually aggressive comments as ”locker room talk.” ”By having such a public figure be a part of that rhetoric, he’s really sort of normalizing it,” Shea said. The band’s previously released singles include ”Empire Records,” ”Bright Lights,” ”Sponge State,” ”Angst,” ”Kill ’Em With Kindness and” ”Shave My Head.” SXSW artist: Trump’s travel ban contributed to racism, Shea said that being in the progressive environment of SXSW has been inspiring, and when they return to Norway, they want to bring some elements, including   bathrooms, back to their shows to foster a welcome and inclusive environment. ”If there’s people that are treated unfairly then it’s unfairness to everyone,” Lokøy said. ”I think that right now, it’s just getting rid of all the social norms for what gender is supposed to be like and not defining people as genders but as persons.”"
Republicans change health care bill in search for votes,CNN,,2017-03-21," (CNN) House Republican leaders released a package of amendments Monday evening to modify the GOP bill to repeal and replace Obamacare    the culmination of days of negotiations and   meetings to win over critics and skeptics of the proposal. The amendments mark efforts by GOP leaders and the White House to appease both conservatives and moderates who have expressed reservations about the bill.  As of Monday, senior Republicans were continuing to whip the GOP conference to ensure that they will have the 216 votes necessary to pass the bill out of the House on Thursday. To ramp up the pressure, President Donald Trump will meet with lawmakers on Capitol Hill Tuesday morning.  Conservatives on health care bill: Negotiations are over, The legislation, called the American Health Care Act, would rewrite the current health care system and lead to millions of more people being uninsured than under Obamacare, according to the Congressional Budget Office.   The bill will be taken up Wednesday by the House Rules Committee and set to be voted on by the House Thursday    the   anniversary of President Barack Obama signing the Affordable Care Act. Changes to Medicaid, Many of the amendments would make additional changes to Medicaid that were pushed by conservative members. One addition would give states the option of requiring   Medicaid recipients to work, participate in job training programs or do community service.    members have been especially irked since Obamacare expanded Medicaid to 11 million   adults without children. Critics, however, say it will make it harder for many   Americans to get needed health care.  Also, the revised legislation would allow states to opt to receive federal Medicaid funding as a block grant for the adults and children in their program. The current bill calls for giving states a set amount of money per enrollee, known as a per capita cap system. (Funding for elderly and disabled participants would be based on enrollment.)  Both would be a major change from the current way Medicaid is funded, which is   federal support tied to state spending on the program. Under a block grant, states would receive a fixed amount of federal funding each year, regardless of how many participants are in the program. This would reduce federal support for Medicaid even more since the funding level would not adjust for increases in enrollment, which often happens in bad economic times. Another alteration would immediately prevent states from expanding Medicaid, a concession to conservative lawmakers. Under the first version of the legislation, enhanced funding for Medicaid would be repealed as of January 1, 2020, but nothing barred states from expanding the program before that. New York state, House leaders also sought to win support from centrist Republicans from upstate New York leaders by adding a provision that would ban the federal government from reimbursing state Medicaid funds raised by local governments, according to New York Rep. Chris Collins. He told CNN the change would help bring along other members of his state’s delegation who are currently wavering on the bill.  The ’ ’ strategy on health care that not everyone can believe in, A House GOP aide told CNN the change would apply to New York state only. In New York, counties outside of New York City send $2. 3 billion to the state to help pay for Medicaid. The amendment would give the state the incentive to stop passing down Medicaid costs to the counties, Collins said.  Tax credits pushed to Senate, House lawmakers punted one important provision to the Senate: Providing more assistance to older consumers, many of whom would face huge premium hikes under the GOP bill. The House is setting aside $75 billion to provide additional tax credits to help people buy policies on the individual market, but they are letting the Senate handle the crafting of the legislation.   The American Health Care Act’s tax credits are not as generous as Obamacare’s subsidies for   enrollees in their 50s and early 60s. As a result, the premium for a    would be 20% to 25% higher in 2026 than it would be under Obamacare, the CBO projected. Lawmakers have been hammered on this point, with the influential AARP warning that it will inform all 38 million of its members how their representatives votes. Beefing up the tax credits, however, will make the legislation more costly. By shifting responsibility to the Senate, lawmakers avoid having to have the CBO   the plan, while assuaging    members to support the bill. Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady told reporters on Monday that older Americans were ”hammered the most by Obamacare.” ”The promise of Obamacare was that if you made young people pay more, you would pay less. And that failed,” Brady said. ”So they’re facing skyrocketing premiums.”"
"Trump, Ryan are working with moderates on health care",CNN,Deirdre Walsh,2017-03-21,"Washington (CNN) Florida Republican Rep. Brian Mast left Washington last week undecided about the GOP health care bill to repeal and replace much of Obamacare. Fortunately, he had a ride home to the Sunshine State: Air Force One. Mast got to discuss his concerns about how the bill would impact the large senior population in his district directly with President Donald Trump and White House chief of staff Reince Priebus on the flight down to West Palm Beach. ”It’s definitely moving in the right direction,” Mast told CNN on Monday, adding he is now a ”lean ’yes’” on the bill. ”They are asking us: What do you think? What does it take to get you to ’yes’?” Mast said. Mast is one of several Republican lawmakers that Trump, House Speaker Paul Ryan and other GOP leaders are targeting as they try to secure the 216 votes they need to pass their health care bill Thursday. Trump is making calls to individual members, according to GOP aides, and will personally address the full House GOP conference on Tuesday morning. House Republican leadership aides make clear that it will be up to Trump to close the deal with the most conservative members of the conference. While conservatives from the House Freedom Caucus are the ones on cable TV loudly and repeatedly slamming the bill, Trump and Ryan are looking elsewhere. Already, instead of the kind of wholesale rewrites that the   wants, Ryan, White House officials and Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price have concentrated on trading more targeted changes proposed by members for their support, according to multiple House GOP leadership sources.    Centrist Republicans have been in frequent contact with leaders and the whip operation and are quietly exerting their own influence.  Late Monday, Ryan unveiled his final changes to the measure. They would make additional changes to Medicaid that were pushed by conservative members, such as giving states the option of requiring   Medicaid recipients to work. Another change would allow states to opt to receive federal Medicaid funding as a block grant.  But many on the right lobbied hard to speed up the date when the Medicaid expansion to the states would be halted. That was too far for House and Senate moderates, along with some of the governors administering the program, and the idea was set aside. Ryan and company still have work left to do. ”I am still a ’no’ on the bill,” Florida Republican Rep. Ileana   told CNN, saying that a high number of her constituents across all age groups who rely on subsidies in the current law will see less support under the GOP bill. She added that she’s no fan of Obamacare and the impact it’s had on her district, but, ”this Republican plan makes the wound that much deeper and harder to heal.” New Jersey Rep. Leonard Lance told CNN that ”I’m a lean ’no. ’” When pressed if any of the new changes could get him to back the bill he replied, ”I doubt it.” Members of the moderate ”Tuesday group” are expected to head to the White House on Tuesday. GOP Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, who represents a district outside Philadelphia, posted on his Facebook page that he couldn’t vote for the bill. ”I have many concerns with this bill, and first among them is the impact on the single most important issue plaguing Bucks and Montgomery Counties, and the issue that I have made my priority in Congress: opioid abuse prevention, treatment and recovery,” Fitzpatrick wrote. In an effort directly targeting centrist Republicans from upstate New York, leaders added a provision designed to transfer more Medicaid dollars from the county level to the state level. New York Rep. Chris Collins told CNN the change would help bring along other members of his state’s delegation who are currently wavering on the bill. The change would apply to New York State only, a GOP aide said.  It’s not just moderates who are still wavering.    members still have concerns that the reconciliation package will make health care insurance more expensive for those over 50. Once the Congressional Budget Office report made it clear this group’s premiums could increase, the message to leaders was clear: That needed to be fixed before the House vote. Ryan signaled on a Sunday talk show that they heard those concerns, saying ”we agree, we believe we should have even more assistance. And that’s one of the things we’re looking at for that person in the 50s and 60s because they experience higher health care costs.” On Monday several House Republicans told CNN that amendments crafted by GOP leaders would pave the way for the Senate to craft more generous tax credit for those aged from  .   House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy told CNN ”we’ve listened to all the different concerns.”  McCarthy explained that the House bill will include a provision allotting resources so that the tax credits can be more generous for those aged   but noted ”the Senate will write the policy” because of procedural issues. He stressed that House GOP members recognize that this change will be part of the final package and added ”there’s a lot in this of what they’ve been asking for.” Conservatives say they’re not sold as well, Mast wasn’t the only lawmaker in Florida. Rep. Mark Meadows,   Carolina, the chair of the House Freedom Caucus, flew to    over the weekend to huddle with top White House officials and Sens. Ted Cruz and Mike Lee, two leading Senate critics of the bill.  Their efforts to get larger changes to the bill were rejected, aides say. A White House meeting with senators Monday also left conservatives unhappy.  The leadership and White House has made the calculation that a bloc of those in the Freedom Caucus would never be satisfied, and any further effort to pull the bill to the right would erode support in the middle. Republican leaders believe Trump’s stamp of approval, plus his personal pitch, will help get them more votes on the right, especially since the President won many of the districts represented by Freedom Caucus members by bigger margins than they did.  ”I don’t think the majority of the Freedom Caucus members are eager to see President Trump fail that would be a risky move for them to make,” one of these senior GOP aides told CNN, suggesting that leaders are banking on a chunk of votes from the group to come through after some additional outreach by the time the vote comes on Thursday. But Freedom Caucus members aren’t giving in yet, and say they have the votes to block the measure. Rep. Raul Labrador,   acknowledged that with Trump’s visit Tuesday morning, ”there’s going to be a lot of pressure, and we all respect Trump and we want to work with him.” But, Labrador said, ”We don’t believe that they have 216 votes. In fact, we know that they don’t have 216 votes.” "
Paul Manafort faces new accusations in Ukraine after document find,CNN,Atika Shubert,2017-03-21,"Kiev (CNN) US President Donald Trump’s   chair Paul Manafort is facing fresh allegations over his links to former   Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych. Ukrainian lawmaker Sergii Leshchenko claims a document found in a safe in Kiev may be evidence that Manafort tried to mask payments to him from Yanukovych’s party. The claim comes as the FBI told the House Intelligence Committee on Monday that it is officially investigating whether there was any coordination between Trump’s campaign team and Russia during the 2016 US election. Leshchenko showed CNN a   document that appears to bear Manafort’s signature on a contract and invoice for 501 units of assorted computer equipment, yielding a payment of $750, 000. CNN has been unable to verify the document’s authenticity, and Manafort said through a spokesman that he did not recognize the document and that the signature was not his. But, if genuine, it could be another piece of the puzzle in an investigation launched by Ukrainian authorities looking at whether Manafort and others received millions of dollars in illegal payments from Yanukovych’s party.  The document is dated October 14, 2009, during the years when Manafort worked for Yanukovych as a political consultant in Kiev. The date of the invoice and the $750, 000 listed on it match the details logged in an    ledger, first reported on by the New York Times, which purports to be from Yanukovych’s party, listing the series of secret payments now under investigation. Manafort’s name appears in the handwritten ledger 22 times as the recipient of payments amounting to $12. 7 million, according to   authorities in Ukraine. With this new document, Leshchenko believes he has evidence that Manafort personally invoiced at least one of these payments from Yanukovych’s political party.   investigators in Ukraine have alleged Yanukovych and members of his party ran a corrupt regime. He fled to Russia following a public uprising in 2014. ”So, it looks like Manafort wasn’t a political consultant. He was a trader of computer processors,” laughs Leschenko.  ”But I’m sure it’s a fake contract and a fake invoice just to establish    artificially establish    a legal basis for a transaction.”  A lawyer representing Yanukovych told CNN he had no information on the transfers.   Manafort: ’unfounded, silly and nonsensical’  Jason Maloni, a spokesman for Manafort, denied all the allegations and referenced Ukraine’s National   Bureau (NABU) in his statement.   ”The allegations against Paul Manafort are baseless, as reflected by the numerous statements from NABU officials who have questioned the validity of the   ledger evidence against Mr. Manafort. Any new allegations by an Serhiy [sic] Leshchenko should be seen in that light and summarily dismissed.” The head of NABU, Artyom Sytnik, told Ukrainian press on November 11, 2016 that ”Mr. Manafort does not have a role in this case.” When the ledger surfaced in the midst of the Trump campaign last year, Manafort told CNN allegations of corruption were ”unfounded, silly and nonsensical,” adding he had never received any cash payments off the book. He has consistently maintained that this work in Ukraine was perfectly legal. But   investigators in Ukraine continue to ask questions about how, when and what amount Manafort and his associates were paid for their work in Kiev.  The FBI is also investigating Manafort over his consulting work in Ukraine and any possible links to Russia. CNN has tried to get a statement from the FBI on investigation of this new document but has received no response.    When CNN asked Leshchenko if he had been contacted by the FBI, he declined to comment. It is unclear if the FBI has seen the document. On Monday, FBI Director James Comey testified to the House of Representatives on the ongoing investigations of Russian links to the Trump administration and attempts to influence the 2016 election, including the role of Manafort as Trump’s campaign manager.   In response, Manafort issued a statement denying ”any involvement with Russian government officials to undermine the interests of the United States.” Manafort has previously suggested that the Ukrainian allegations of corruption were part of an attempt by Leshchenko to blackmail him with compromising information about him and Trump. Leshchenko denied those allegations to CNN. Those allegations arose from text messages allegedly obtained from a hack of an iPhone belonging to Manafort’s daughter. Leshchenko  denies he had anything to do with the messages, telling CNN it was a ”big surprise” that he was caught up in the scandal and insisting he never wrote any messages to ”Manafort, his daughter or any members of his family.”   The details, The contract and invoice purport to be between the Ukrainian office of      a company that Manafort partly owns    and Neocom Systems Ltd. Details about Neocom Systems are scarce. The document showed Neocoms’s address as 1 Mapp St Belize City, which houses several offshore companies, including some named in the Panama Papers.  The address belongs to a company named International Corporate Services.  When contacted, the company’s managing director, Lizette Ortiz, said Neocom had been dissolved in 2014 and was no longer a legal entity in Belize. ”We also confirm that we never managed the affairs of this company nor did they physically conduct their business from or within our offices.  ”We confirm that we were merely the company’s Registered   Office (which is a requirement by law for each company to have) at the time of incorporation and never gave them permission or received compensation from them to advertise that they physically had an office or physical presence at our address nor the usage of our telephone numbers or email addresses and if so they would have been doing so illegally,” Ortiz said in an email to CNN. A report by ICP Credit describes Neocom as an offshore company, and gives almost no other details, other than it was established in 2005 with $50, 000 of capital. CNN was unable to reach the company through the phone number the report listed. But the contract and invoice suggest an    paper trail    Neocom lists its bank accounts in Kyrgyzstan and Germany. The ”Asiatic Universal Bank” listed as Neocom’s bank was nationalized by the Kyrgysztan government in 2010 amid allegations of money laundering.  In the document,   lists its Wachovia bank account in the US to receive money for the invoice.   A locked safe, The document was discovered after the new tenants of an office in Kiev cracked open a locked safe that had been left behind by the previous tenants    a group of American lobbyists, according to Leshchenko. The document might have been forgotten as an odd but otherwise innocuous office relic, if not for what appears to be Manafort’s signature, scrawled in black over a blue Ukrainian stamp. Leshchenko has built a career exposing political corruption in Ukraine, first as an investigative journalist and now as a lawmaker. He often receives tips and documents, sometimes mailed anonymously to his office. On Tuesday, Leshchenko laid out his case to reporters in a press conference holding up copies of the document and the Party of Regions ledger side by side: ”This transaction was a payment for political consultancy according to the Black Ledger. But this fake invoice and fake contract signed by Paul Manafort is not about political consulting. It’s about selling of computers.”    Asked if he believes this is evidence of money laundering in a CNN interview, he said: ”I believe this issue needs to be investigated and this issue has to be checked. But in my experience, this looks like money laundering and wire fraud.” But Phil Griffin, a former lobbyist with   in Kiev, dismissed claims that the company was trying to cover up a money trail and he cast doubt on the authenticity of the document, saying Leshchenko has ”zero credibility”.   ”I wasn’t involved in the accounting. Only the day to day political operations,” he told CNN. ”Look, it’s a photocopy of a    document.  It’s probably completely fabricated. I think it’s all made up.”   After the interview, Leshchenko offered to drive CNN to the former office of   in Kiev. There is no sign on the ground floor office, no name on the doorbell and no indication of the political operation that brought Yanukovych into power.  Leshchenko  called the place an ”artifact of corruption” and compared it to Yanukovych’s former palace, now transformed into a public park and ”Museum of Corruption.” ”I think it’s very important for people to see what corruption looks like. Not only a virtual reality, but in a reality they can see and feel.”"
House Freedom Caucus still believes it can stop leadership’s health care bill,CNN,Deirdre Walsh,2017-03-21,"Washington (CNN) Members of the House Freedom Caucus continue to claim there are enough ”no” votes to kill House leadership’s plan to repeal and replace Obamacare, which is headed to the House floor Thursday.  ”I’m confident that we have still enough concerns that a vote of 216 votes in the House would not happen today,” said Rep. Mark Meadows,   Carolina, the Freedom Caucus chairman. The group met Monday night for several hours with three Republican senators who have also expressed discontentment with the House legislation: Mike Lee of Utah, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Ted Cruz of Texas.  Trump today: Live updates on health care, Gorsuch, the FBI and Russia, After their meeting, Freedom Caucus members emerged confident that the bill wouldn’t pass without significant changes. Their comments came just hours before President Donald Trump is expected to huddle with House Republicans Tuesday morning.  Rep. Raul Labrador admits that with Trump’s visit Tuesday morning ”there’s going to be a lot of pressure, and we all respect Trump and we want to work with him.” But the Idaho Republican said that now that leaders and the White House are indicating to them and others that no major changes will be added ”it means the bill is going to fail.” Asked if he was confident it couldn’t pass Thursday, he said, ”I’m confident.”  ”We don’t believe that they have 216 votes. In fact, we know that they don’t have 216 votes,” Labrador said flatly.  Several conservatives leaving the Monday night meeting were briefed on the changes that GOP leaders were making to the bill in an effort to get broader support but they all told CNN that based on their early read on these they wouldn’t be enough to get their support. RELATED: Republicans change health care bill in search for votes, Freedom Caucus members have been lobbying the White House and GOP leadership for changes to the bill, saying it doesn’t go far enough to repeal Obamacare.  Multiple Freedom Caucus members noted that Meadows was back at the White House Monday but were frustrated that his efforts to argue for additional changes were being shut down by House GOP leaders, who advised Trump officials they were finished making any more modifications. Michigan Rep Justin Amash, asked how many members of the Freedom Caucus remain solidly opposed, said, ”I believe more than enough to defeat the bill on the House floor so it’s on leadership to decide whether they want to do that or not.”  Alabama GOP Rep. Mo Brooks told reporters ‎the House Freedom Caucus took a position a week ago and they still strongly oppose the bill.  ”‎I like where we are and as you know, I believe this is a really bad bill for the United States of America, and I think we are going to kill it,” he said.  Asked if the White House is miscalculating how much support there is for the House bill, Rep. Scott Perry, a Republican from Pennsylvania, said ”I don’t know what their calculation is. I know what I see.”  Meadows noted that he expects pressure, but that this is ”a defining moment for the Freedom Caucus.” "
GOP Sen. Jeff Flake: Trump should apologize for wiretapping claim,CNN,,2017-03-21," (CNN) Republican Sen. Jeff Flake said Monday that President Donald Trump should apologize to Barack Obama for alleging that the former president had ordered a wiretap of Trump Tower during the presidential campaign. Flake, one of Trump’s foremost Republican critics during the campaign, was asked on ”Mac  Gaydos” on KTAR Arizona radio if he felt Trump should publicly admit he was wrong.  ”I think that ought to happen and we ought to move on,” Flake replied. Asked later in the interview if his worst fears about Trump had been confirmed, Flake repeated his view that the President should apologize to his predecessor, though he said he didn’t think that Trump’s campaign had colluded with the Russians to defeat Hillary Clinton. ”Well, I’m not saying that I believe that the Trump campaign was involved with Russians on this. Frankly, my guess is that they didn’t,” Flake said. ”I wouldn’t want to believe that about anybody. But the accusations about the former president wiretapping, that’s a serious allegation that you make about somebody. And that’s not  . And I would hope that the President would apologize and move on.” Earlier this month, Trump accused Obama of wiretapping him in Trump Tower prior to the November election. Neither Trump nor his administration has produced any evidence to support the claim. On Monday, in a hearing before the House Intelligence Committee, FBI Director James Comey said that he had ”no information” to support Trump’s wiretapping claim. Flake said earlier in the radio interview that Comey’s testimony further confirmed his belief that Trump’s allegation was false.  ”I never believed it from the beginning and it’s been confirmed by every intelligence arm that we have,” the Arizona Republican said. ”That would’ve been a big, big deal had that happened and I was quite confident that it didn’t and it’s now, there’s simply no evidence that it occurred.”"

South Sudan plane crash: All on board survive ’miraculous’ landing,CNN,,2017-03-20," (CNN) A commercial plane on Monday made a crash landing in poor weather at an airport in South Sudan, causing several injuries among the 43 on board. ”It is miraculous, completely,” said Ateny Wek Ateny, the South Sudanese presidential spokesperson. ”There are only minor injuries. There was no single death.” The incident took place at the airport in Wau, in the nation’s northwest. Ateny said the pilot overshot the runway, dropping onto an unpaved ground.  The plane’s right wing hit a car and a fire started on the right side of the plane, Ateny said. The pilot opened the door near the tail, which was not on fire. ”The crew managed to evacuate everyone,” Ateny said. Initially authorities were not able to find all the passengers because they fled the scene. Wal Achieng, an official at South Supreme Airlines in Wau, said the plane carried 40 adults and three children.   were taken to hospitals, Achieng said. Three remain hospitalized with minor injuries, Ateny said. ”The weather was not good,” Achieng said, citing very cloudy conditions. The plane was headed from the capital, Juba, to Wau.  Juba is located in the southern region of the country. Achieng said the fire initially led many people to think there would be no survivors.  South Sudan, which gained its independence from Sudan in 2011, has endured war political instability and famine. It is a landlocked country in   Africa, bordering Sudan, Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Central African Republic.  More than 12 million people live in South Sudan. It is populated by many ethnic groups, including the Dinka and Nuer, and the dominant faiths are Christian and animist."
Hospital recommends Beyonce and ABBA for CPR training,CNN,,2017-03-21," (CNN) We always knew Missy Elliott’s music would save lives one day, and this week, New York Presbyterian Hospital confirmed our suspicions.  In an effort to help train first responders in   CPR, the hospital dropped a   playlist   with artists from Beyonce to Lynyrd Skynyrd. The hospital site lists out all the CPR steps, but the key number to remember is 100 compressions per minute. That’s where the playlist comes in.  With every song bumping at the 100    benchmark, each works as a guide for timing compressions. Headlining the playlist is the most applicable song: ”Stayin’ Alive” by the Bee Gees. However, if you want a song that’s less   the hospital also recommends ”Hips Don’t Lie” by Shakira and ”One Week” by Barenaked Ladies.  Although this playlist was created to help save lives, it could easily double as the perfect soundtrack for a middle school dance. So whether you’re saving someone in cardiac arrest or simply want to get through your workday, it’s time to throw on ”Dancing Queen” by ABBA and get that heart pumping. "
Footballer who thanked wife and girlfriend in interview digs bigger hole,CNN,Yemisi Adegoke ,2017-03-20," (CNN) The footballer who mistakenly thanked his wife and girlfriend during his   match interview has denied he’s been unfaithful.  Mohammed Anas appeared to dig himself into an even bigger hole when he said he was talking about his daughter in the now legendary interview.  ”My family knows that I call my daughter my girlfriend. That’s what I was talking about. I don’t have a girlfriend,” the Ghanaian striker said. Anas who plays for South African team ’Free State Stars,’ was named ’man of the match’ after scoring two goals in the Star’s draw against Ajax Cape Town. His   interview started innocuously enough when he thanked God and his fans, but things took a decidedly awkward turn when he suddenly blurted out: ”Thank you for this, I appreciate my fans. My wife and girlfriend. ..I mean my wife, sorry to say,” he quickly added.  Viewers squirmed as Anas realized his blunder and started groveling to his wife: ”I’m so sorry. ..I love you so much, I love you so much from my heart!” Anas has now spoken out and said he has nothing to worry about from his wife of seven years.  ”I love her so much. She’s given me two beautiful children. She is fine. She knows what kind of man I am so I am not worried,” he told the BBC.  ”I’m famous now   people around the world know me,” the footballer added.  Quite. .. but for all the wrong reasons. .. "
Gorsuch faces grilling in Senate hearing,CNN,Ashley Killough,2017-03-21,"Washington (CNN) Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch sought to prove his judicial independence and asserted that he had no problem ruling against the President who appointed him, saying, ”no man is above the law.”  In his second day of confirmation hearings, Gorsuch repeatedly tried to avoid prejudging any future cases, maintaining before the Senate Judiciary Committee that he’s a ”fair judge.”  Tuesday marked the committee’s first chance to publicly ask him questions. Some senators tried to quiz the federal judge on previous positions and actions taken by President Donald Trump on issues like immigration and torture.  Without stating his personal opinions, Gorsuch attempted to stay on independent turf, though he appeared to distance himself from the President’s past comments calling for the reinstatement of torture.  Asked by Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont whether he thinks the President has the right to authorize torture if it violates law, Gorsuch ticked off a list of precedents that ban torture. ”We have a convention against torture and implementing legislation which bans torture,” he said. ”We have the Detainee Treatment Act, which we talked about earlier, which bans cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment. We also have an 8th Amendment.” Leahy asked Gorsuch the same question once again. ”Senator, no man is above the law,” Gorsuch responded.  Questions about Trump’s statements, policies  Gorsuch also stated that the Trump administration never asked him to make promises to rule certain ways on certain decisions. Asked specifically by Sen. Lindsey Graham,   Carolina, if he was asked by the president  to overturn Roe v. Wade, Gorsuch said no.  He was further pressed on what he would have done if Trump had asked him to do so.  ”Senator, I would have walked out the door,” Gorsuch said, as the room fell silent. ”That’s not what judges do. They don’t do it at that end of Pennsylvania Avenue and they shouldn’t do it at this end either.” On the President’s travel ban that prevents immigration from six majority Muslim countries, Gorsuch said he will ”apply the law faithfully and fearlessly” when asked about whether a blanket religious test is consistent with the First Amendment. ”We have a Constitution and it does guarantee free exercise and it also guarantees equal protection of the laws and a whole lot else,” Gorsuch said in reply to a question from Leahy. ”The Supreme Court, in (Zubayadah) said that due process rights extend even to undocumented persons in this country. I will apply the law. I will apply the law faithfully and fearlessly.” ”Anyone, any law is going to get a fair and square deal with me,” he added.  Answering his first question of the day, Gorsuch said that he wouldn’t have any trouble ruling against the President who nominated him.  While there was no mention of Trump in the question    which came from the top Republican on the committee, Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley    nor in Gorsuch’s answer, it comes as Trump has made headlines twice in the past year for criticizing federal judges whose decisions he didn’t like.  Grassley argued that ”no one    not even the President    is above the law,” and asked Gorsuch if it would be problematic for him to decide against the President.  ”That’s a softball, Mr. Chairman,” Gorsuch responded. ”I have no difficulty ruling against or for any party other than based on what the law and the facts in the particular case require.” Big guy vs. little guy, Gorsuch pushed back against Democratic criticism that he has mostly ruled in favor of big companies or government, arguing Tuesday that he’s ruled in favor of ”the little guy,” as well.  ”I’d like to convey to you    from the bottom of my heart    is that I am a fair judge,” Gorsuch said to Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the committee’s top Democrat.  He listed off a number of cases in which he felt he ruled against ”the big guy.”  ”I have participated in 2, 700 opinions over 10 and a half years. And, if you want cases where I’ve ruled for the little guy as well as the big guy, there are plenty of them,” he said.  He specifically named a ruling in favor of landowners in a lawsuit over nuclear waste at the Rocky Flats plant, which he said ”vindicated the rights of people who had been subject to pollution by large companies in Colorado.” Critics have pointed to his decision in a case in which a trucker was fired for abandoning his   trailer in freezing temperatures to seek safety.  The trucker, Alphonse Maddin, filed a complaint asserting that his firing violated a federal safety law. In a   decision the 10th US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in Maddin’s favor.  Gorsuch dissented. ”A trucker was stranded on the side of the road, late at night, in cold weather, and his trailer brakes were stuck,” Gorsuch wrote and noted that the company ”fired him for disobeying orders and abandoning its trailer and goods.”  ”It might be fair to ask whether TransAm’s decision was a wise or kind one,” he wrote. ”But it’s not our job to answer questions like that. Our only task is to decide whether the decision was an illegal one.”  Sen. Al Franken,   lambasted Gorsuch for his decision, calling it absurd.  ”It is absurd to say this company is in its rights to fire him because he made the choice of possibly dying from freezing to death or causing other people to die possibly by driving an unsafe vehicle. That’s absurd. Now, I had a career in identifying absurdity, and I know it when I see it and it makes me question your judgment.” Gorsuch hits back at claims made by former student, Gorsuch sharply denied accusations made by a former student that he suggested in a law class last year that women unethically use companies for maternity benefits. Jennifer Sisk, a former student in Gorsuch’s ethics class at the University of Colorado Law School, wrote a letter to the committee saying Gorsuch asked for students’ opinions about a hypothetical scenario, in which, a woman applied for a job at a large law firm and planned to start a family with her husband in the near future. ”He asked the class to raise their hands if they knew of a female who had used a company to get maternity benefits and then left right after having a baby,” she writes. Sisk writes that at one point Gorsuch ”became more animated saying ’C’mon guys.’ He then announced that all our hands should be raised because ’many’ women use their companies for maternity benefits and then leave the company after the baby is born.” Sisk, a registered Democrat who once worked for former Democratic Sen. Mark Udall of Colorado, said she raised her concerns to the school’s administration, but the school apologized Monday night, saying it never notified Gorsuch of the complaint.  Sen. Dick Durbin,   asked Gorsuch about the incident. Gorsuch said he pulled the scenario from a textbook when talking about some of the challenges young lawyers will face in the workforce.  He said he posed the hypothetical, asking students to weigh in on how they would respond if they faced such a question and then discussed the pros and cons of potential answers.  ”I do ask for a show of hands    not about the question you asked, but about the following question, and I ask it of everybody: How many of you have had questions like this asked of you in the employment environment? An inappropriate question about your family planning?” Gorsuch said. ”And I am shocked every year senator how many young women raise their hands, it’s disturbing to me.” Supporters of Gorsuch also put forth statements from three other students who claimed that Sisk inaccurately framed the class discussion. Gorsuch tries not to ’tip his hand’  Gorsuch was also pressed on his view of previous cases. As is tradition with Supreme Court nominees, Gorsuch declined to give direct answers, saying it would be ”inappropriate” to suggest how he would rule on already established precedents.  ”I would be tipping my hand and suggesting to litigants that I have already made up my mind,” he said.  His answers are consistent with what’s called the ”Ginsburg standard,” a precedent set by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in her 1993 confirmation to not comment on cases, so as not to hint at how she would rule in future cases.  Asked specifically by Feinstein about Roe v. Wade, Gorsuch would not state his personal views or say whether he thought it was a ”” like she asked.  ”It has been reaffirmed many times, I can say that,” he said.  As senators tried to dig and prod to get his political views on the record, Gorsuch continuously dodged, citing a need to remain objective.  ”A good judge doesn’t give a wit about politics or the political implications of his or her decision,” he said.  Gorsuch was slightly more open to talking about issues of religious liberty, something he has written extensively about. This is also consistent with the Ginsburg standard    talking more freely about what topics the nominee has previously written about than things that might be before the court. Nearly six hours into the hearing, Gorsuch appeared to show some frustration with the confirmation process.  Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island and staunch opponent of the Citizens United ruling, was questioning Gorsuch on money spent in favor of his nomination by groups that don’t disclose their donors and asked if that concerned him.  ”Senator, there’s a lot about the confirmation process today that I regret. A lot. A lot,” he said. ”When (former Supreme Court Justice) Byron White sat here, it was 90 minutes. He was through this body in two weeks and he smoked cigarettes while he gave his testimony. There’s a great deal about this process I regret. I regret putting my family through this.” Whitehouse kept asking him about what’s known as dark money groups and whether it bothers him. Gorsuch, who was trying not to indicate how he would rule on any cases involving the issue, avoided sharing his personal view.   ”Senator, the fact of the matter is it is what it is,” Gorsuch said, somewhat agitated. ”And it’s this body that makes the laws and if you wish to have more disclosure, pass a law and a judge will enforce it, Senator.” Later, Sen Mike Lee,   argued it was ”unfair” for Whitehouse to question Gorsuch on Citizens   issues and asked the judge if he had any involvement in the Supreme Court ruling.  ”I was not involved,” he said, before adding forcefully, in an apparent reference to the group spending money, that he speaks only for himself. ”Nobody speaks for me. Nobody.  I speak for me. I am a judge. I don’t have spokesman. I speak for myself.” This story has been updated to reflect breaking news."
Risky surgery separates 10-month-old from parasitic twin,CNN,Ashley Strickland,2017-03-21," (CNN) It was late January when Nancy Swabb found herself wanting to help a family across the Atlantic Ocean, in Cote d’Ivoire    all because of a photo. A friend had shared a post on Facebook about the need for a host family for a    girl for two months while she received medical care in Park Ridge, Illinois. The post came from Children’s Medical Mission West, a nonprofit that helps transport children around the world to receive free medical care for rare conditions and issues. Swabb saw a photo of baby Dominique on her mother’s lap. ”That photo really captured my heart,” Swabb said. ”She looked so sweet.” The nonprofit has asked CNN not to include Dominique’s last name for privacy reasons. Dominique had a twin, but she never fully developed, instead fusing with her in the womb. She was born with what is known as a parasitic twin, where the underdeveloped twin formed incompletely and was entirely dependent on Dominique’s body.  She was born with her parasitic twin’s waist, legs and feet growing out of her back. Dominique was also born with two spines that were closely connected. Cases of parasitic twins are so rare that most of them are known by the names of the patients.  Without surgery to remove the parasitic twin, Dominique’s life would not be a very long one. Her tiny heart and lungs were working to support the equivalent of two bodies. The mass of kicking legs attached to her neck and back would continue to grow, causing deformity, abnormal forces on the spine and a life of pain, doctors said.  But the complicated surgery would have to be done at a hospital equipped to handle the risks, and Dominique would need a foster family to help her get through it. A part of the family, Swabb, a native Chicagoan, realized that the Park Ridge, Illinois address belonged to Advocate Children’s Hospital, only about 7 miles from her family’s home. She and her husband, Tim, knew they could help and reached out.  They went through a vetting process and confirmed that they would be able to take Dominique to all of her appointments at the hospital, which had been scheduled through the organization.  Children’s Medical Mission West had raised funds for Dominique’s flight, in which she would be escorted by a flight attendant who donated her time.  But the family, which has two adopted daughters    Lena, 15, and Mara, 9    realized they still needed to make ready for Dominique’s arrival.  Swabb, a special events coordinator, asked her neighbors in the   Edgebrook community whether they could borrow anything for the baby they would be fostering. Within two days, a pile taller than Swabb herself filled the house. Neighbors eagerly donated packages of diapers, formula, wipes, clothes, a stroller, a car seat and a playpen. Mara and her friends organized all of the items in the family’s basement to make them easily accessible.  Baby Dominique arrived to a warm reception three days later, on February 5.  Swabb’s daughters were thrilled to have a new baby in the house. Mara seemed to bond with Dominique almost instantly, and they enjoyed making each other laugh.  ”Baby Dominique is so affectionate and receives love so well, so we knew right away that she comes from a loving family,” Swabb said. ”She’s bubbly, funny, spirited, full of smiles, and has the brightest, happy eyes.” Swabb’s daily walks with Dominique in the stroller stretched to an hour as neighbors stopped to greet the baby they had helped welcome. The neighbors offered to watch her so Swabb could get things done around the house. Their home became open to visitors. Even her cousin’s teenage sons enjoyed playing peekaboo and making silly faces just to make Dominique laugh.  ”She has become the community baby, and everyone has been really interested in her story,” Swabb said.  A complex surgery, Even before her surgery on March 8, baby Dominique spent hours in the hospital, undergoing tests and preparation. Doctors at Advocate Children’s Hospital ordered an MRI, an MRA, a CAT scan,   and a CT myelogram to analyze the anatomy of the the parasitic twin and how it connected.  They used the scans and imaging to create a   model of Dominique’s two spines. They also discovered a second bladder behind the extra limbs that would need to be removed.  Dr. John Ruge, a pediatric neurosurgeon at Advocate, had worked with Children’s Medical Missions West before. He constructed a team of five surgeons and more than 50 physicians spanning specialties across the hospital to remove the excess limbs.  ”It allowed us to come up with a plan of attack how we could safely and effectively remove this very complex part attached to this little baby’s spine and end up with a healthy and happy child at the end of the day,” said Dr. Frank Vicari, a pediatric plastic and reconstructive surgeon at Adovcate who has operated with Ruge for years. The team staged a mock operation to figure out who would be doing what at specific parts of the procedure.  On March 8, the team worked for six hours to remove the entirety of the parasitic twin. They had to be careful to disconnect any nerves and blood vessels so that Dominique wouldn’t sustain damage, numbness or paralysis.  Through extensive planning, they were even able to remove it all in one piece. She is now 2 pounds lighter. All that remains is part of an abnormal bone that stabilizes Dominique’s spinal column. They used soft tissue from the twin’s thigh to cover the area.  Baby Dominique exceeded their expectations at every turn. She recovered so well that she was sitting up the next day and sticking her tongue out. She went home in five days, and the doctors do not foresee any complications or need for followup surgery. Dominique still has two spines. They are hers alone. They are so intertwined that the doctors aren’t entirely sure which spine her structural support and bodily functions rely on. To look at an   Dominique has one brain connected to one spinal cord that diverges into two, each going into a spinal column.  The doctors were not able to find a comparable case to Dominique. She is unique, they said.  They don’t anticipate that having the two spines will affect her.  ”Like any child, she needs to be cared for and watched for developmental issues,” Ruge said. ”She has slightly more risk because she is built slightly more different than other children. But she looks great. We had 100 worries before surgery, and risks were high, so we’re pleased with how she’s doing.” The team at Advocate Children’s Hospital combined neurosurgeons, plastic and craniofacial surgeons, pediatric orthopedics, anesthesiologists, nephrologists, radiologists, the Pediatic Intensive Care Unit, physician assistants, nursing staff, therapists and many others to make baby Dominique’s surgery a success    with no surprises. ”One of the joys of being a physicians is taking a challenging case, working with a team of talented people where each of us contributes something and having that be better than any one individual can do,” Ruge said. ”Everyone had their whole heart in this.” Swabb’s family will continue to foster Dominique until   when she can be medically cleared to reunite with her birth family in Cote d’Ivoire. In the meantime, Swabb has been sharing photos and updates with Children’s Medical Missions West, which translates them into French to communicate with her family across the ocean.  Swabb hopes the two families can meet one day. She already feels a bond with Dominique’s birth mother, created by the trust she was willing to place in a stranger to care for her baby.  In the time Dominique has been with the Swabbs, her first two teeth have come in, she saw snow for the first time, and she started eating solid food and sleeps through the night. Swabb can’t wait for her to experience more firsts with her family in Cote d’Ivoire. ”I can’t wait for her parents to see her,” Swabb said. ”To give love for a certain amount of time and have a connection with a family you’ve never met is so amazing. You have that trust in each other and do the best you can to give love and care and bring her back healthy and ready for a new life.”"
Conjoined Twins Fast Facts,CNN,,2013-07-11," (CNN) Here’s some background information about conjoined twins. Conjoined twins are physically connected to one another at some point on their bodies. Conjoined twins occur once every 200, 000 live births, according to the University of Maryland Medical Center. About 70% of conjoined twins are female.  Conjoined twins are identical   they are the same sex. The form of conjoined twinning refers to the point where the twins are joined. The top five, starting with the most frequent: thoracopagus (heart, liver, intestine) omphalopagus (liver, biliary tree, intestine) pygopagus (spine, rectum, genitourinary tract) ischiopagus (pelvis, liver, intestine, genitourinary tract) and craniopagus (brain, meninges). (Mayo Clinic) Scientists believe that conjoined twins develop from a single fertilized egg that fails to separate completely as it divides.    The term ”Siamese twins” originated with Eng and Chang Bunker, a set of conjoined twins who were born in Siam (now Thailand) in 1811. They lived to age 63 and appeared in traveling exhibitions. Chang and Eng both married and fathered a total of 21 children between them. In 1955, neurosurgeon Dr. Harold Voris of Mercy Hospital in Chicago performed the first successful procedure separating conjoined twins joined at the head.

"Ivanka Trump to get top security clearance and office, WH official says",CNN,Eli Watkins,2017-03-21,"Washington (CNN) Ivanka Trump will work out of an office in the West Wing and get a security clearance, a White House official told CNN Monday. The official also confirmed Trump will receive   communication devices, although she will not be a government employee.  The move places President Donald Trump’s eldest daughter    long one of his closest advisers    at the center of his administration. Asked at a press briefing on Tuesday about the matter, White House press secretary Sean Spicer responded that Ivanka Trump would, by her own choice and at the advice of her attorney, follow rules prescribed for government employees despite being outside of government. ”Ivanka has taken on several measures to promote high standards of ethical conduct,” Spicer said. ”Even though she’s not a federal employee, she’ll follow the restrictions that would apply if she were. She’s taken these steps with the advice of counsel and in consultation of the Office of Government Ethics.” In the initial weeks of the Trump presidency, she has held no formal role but appeared alongside the President and senior staffers in major meetings with world leaders and business figures. She has also reportedly weighed in on policy issues and established a   presence in the White House. Trump’s husband, Jared Kushner, has been a senior White House adviser since the outset of the administration. The Department of Justice assessed at the time that the hire did not violate   laws. CNN has reached out to Ivanka Trump’s attorney, Jamie Gorelick, for comment on the matter. Politico reported the development earlier Monday. Trump, like her father, has business interests throughout the country and across the world. By gaining a position in the West Wing and getting access to classified information, she has drawn a new wave of scrutiny over conflicts in the administration between public roles and private interests.   Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway faced backlash after promoting Ivanka Trump’s fashion line on television, but the White House opted not to penalize her for the apparent ethical violation. Like her siblings Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, Ivanka as taken an active role in her father’s business interests over the course of her life, both in his real estate empire and reality TV show, ”The Apprentice.” She made regular appearances on the campaign trail and has been by her father’s side during many major moments of his early presidency. The move into a West Wing office brings her role in the administration closer to formality and puts one of the   ’s closest confidants on firmer ground."
Africa’s most populous city just got its first skate crew ,CNN,,2017-03-21,"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) Despite the boom of skateboarding on the continent, Lagos might seem like an unlikely place for the sport to take off. The megacity which boasts of an estimated population of around 18 million, has no skate parks, few pavements and heavily congested roads.  But WAFFLESNCREAM, a group of avid young skaters are taking to the streets to change this perception.  ”Skate boarding can be anywhere,” Jomi   one of the   of WAFFLESNCREAM told CNN. ”There aren’t many pavements in Lagos, but we skate on empty streets, parks and abandoned sites.” ”It’s not just a sport, it’s a community, it’s very freeing and it’s a brotherhood.” WAFFLESNCREAM  started out as a lifestyle brand with a vibrant online community attracting people from Lagos and Lusaka to Leeds.  Eight years later the team have opened their first skate store in Lagos and hope to increase interest in skate culture through film, photography and illustration.  ”We had our first exhibition tagged ”Friends  Family in March,”    continued. ”The exhibition is aimed at revealing the unconventionality in our artists who comprise of skaters, photographers and illustrators.”  Despite the challenges of skating in Lagos,   says: ”People are intrigued when they see the crew on their boards because it’s a sport that just keeps people glued.” This sentiment is shared by many others on the continent’s growing scene. Last year $35, 000 was raised through crowdfunding to open a skate park in Addis Ababa.  Kenya held it’s first skating competition in Nairobi in 2015 and there are thriving skate scenes in Madagascar and Uganda, WAFFLESNCREAM hope Lagos will be next.  ”It’s exciting and [the scene] could grow beyond our control if the right parties are involved, most especially, the government.  ”Skating is going to be part of the 2020 Olympics so it’s something for us to aim for and it would be great to have their support. I feel we are the last piece of the puzzle provided we get the support needed,” said  . After cementing their position in Lagos by building a skate park, the collective hope to take the message of skating nationwide.  ”We are currently trying to build a skate park in the empty space under Falomo bridge and we are positive it will come through.” ”It’s very freeing, skateboarding really is a sport that can bring a whole nation together.”"
"Building homes, inspiring hope in Mexico",CNN,,2017-03-20," (CNN) Many families in Mexico migrate to the country’s Baja region on the West Coast seeking jobs and better lives. Though they find employment, they often join the ranks of Mexico’s ”working poor,” barely earning the equivalent of $100 a week.  Their homes are piecemeal, built out of scrap parts  —   some missing a roof and lacking electricity. These families want better homes, but simply can’t afford them. One nonprofit organization is trying to to help . Homes of Hope International builds houses for families in need    like the Noyes Cervantes family from Tijuana. The family of six lives in a plywood and cinder block structure, measuring 6 feet by 10 feet, with a tarp for a roof and a dirt floor. Luis and Susana share a mattress on the ground with their four children. The family squeezes into the room, which barely holds the mattress, a rickety bookshelf to hold clothes, and a propane burner to cook food. There is no door or windows or even electricity. The only plumbing they have is their makeshift bathroom    a toilet, a hose for a shower, and a utility sink.  ”We’re very cramped. We’re not satisfied,” said Luis. ”It was difficult to sleep at night, all of us on the same mattress and we would complain every day.” Luis works   graveyard shifts at a factory    earning about $75 a week. He saved up enough from his factory job to buy a small piece of land, but he doesn’t have money to build a home. That’s where Homes of Hope International comes in. The group’s founder believes home ownership can help end a family’s poverty. ”When people get a house, they actually think differently about their future,” says Homes of Hope’s Sean Lambert. ”In one generation, you can break the cycle of poverty over a family’s life. ”’ Lambert says providing a safe, clean home can end poverty because families no longer have to save up to build a house. They can put that money towards their children’s education, eat healthier food, and by no longer living on a dirt floor    lower the risk of illnesses. Since its first home in 1990, the organization has built more than 4, 000 houses in the northern Baja region of Mexico. It’s also expanded to other parts of the world such as Africa and Asia. The homes are built by volunteers who sign up to work a weekend alongside Homes of Hope staff. Each house is completed in two days    rain or shine. Jason Solomon volunteered with his family and friends. Solomon was astounded by the Noyes Cervantes’ living conditions and also by their graciousness. ”It was shocking and humbling. ..and overwhelming,” said Solomon who hails from Southern California and works in finance. ”They seem to be happy with what they have.”  To receive a home, a family must own their own land, be employed, and have children. The homes are either 16 by 16 feet or 16 by 20 with three rooms, electricity, windows and doors. They come furnished with new furniture and kitchenware.  ”To just see the joy in their faces and the excitement,” said Solomon, whose teenage son convinced him to volunteer after building a house last year. ”I’m going to see that image probably for the rest of my life.” The Noyes Cervantes family not only received a new home but an unexpected outpouring of support from the volunteers.  ”I was shocked because there is a lot of love coming from people that do not know you, yet they give you a lot of love and so much security,” said Susana. "
Why Jesus’ parables make us uncomfortable ,CNN,,2017-02-15," (CNN) It was once said, ”religion is designed to comfort the afflicted and to afflict the comfortable.” Jesus’ parables    short stories with moral lessons    were likewise designed to afflict, to draw us in but leave us uncomfortable. These teachings can be read as being about divine love and salvation, sure. But, their first listeners    first century Jews in Galilee and Judea    heard much more challenging messages. Only when we hear the parables as Jesus’ own audience did can we fully experience their power and find ourselves surprised and challenged today. Here are four examples of Jesus’ teachings that everybody gets wrong: The ’Parable of the Prodigal Son’ This parable is usually seen as a story of how our ”Father in heaven” loves us regardless of how despicable our actions. This is a lovely message, and I would not want to dismiss it. It is not, however, what   Jews would have heard. Jesus’ Jewish audience already knew that their ”Father in heaven” was loving, forgiving, and compassionate. It is Luke who sets up a message of repenting and forgiving. Luke prefaces our parable with two shorter ones: the Parables of the Lost Sheep and the Lost Coin. The evangelist concludes them with, ”There will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over   righteous persons who need no repentance.” But is this really what the parables are about? Jesus was not talking about ovine sin or coinage cupidity sheep don’t feel guilty and coins don’t repent. Moreover, the man loses the sheep the woman loses her coin. But God does not ”lose us.” The first two parables are not about repenting and forgiving. They are about counting: The shepherd noticed one sheep missing out of 100, and the woman noticed one coin missing from 10. And they searched, found, rejoiced, and celebrated. In doing so, they set up the third parable. The Prodigal Son story begins: ”There was a man who had two sons . .. ” If we focus on the one prodigal son, we mishear the opening. Every biblically literate Jew would know that if there are two sons, go with the younger: Abel over Cain, Isaac over Ishmael, Jacob over Esau, Ephraim over Manasseh. But parables never go the way we want. We cannot identify with junior, who ”squandered all he had in dissolute living.” Next, if we see the father as surprising when he welcomes junior home, we mishear again. Dad is simply delighted that junior has returned: He rejoices and throws a party. If we stop here, we’ve failed to count. The older brother    remember him?    hears music and dancing. Dad had enough time to hire the band and the caterer, but he never searched for his older son. He had two sons, and he didn’t count. Our parable is less about forgiving and more about counting, and making sure everyone counts. Whom have we lost? If we don’t count, it may be too late. The ’Parable of the Good Samaritan’ Our usual understanding of this famous story goes astray in several ways. Here are two. First, readers presume that a priest and Levite bypass the wounded man because they are attempting to avoid becoming ”unclean.” Nonsense. All this interpretation does is make Jewish Law look bad. The priest is not going up to Jerusalem where purity would be a concern    he is ”going down” to Jericho. No law prevents Levites from touching corpses, and there are numerous other reasons why ritual purity is not relevant here. Jesus mentions priest and Levite because they set up a third category: Israelite. To mention the first two is to invoke the third. If I say, ”Larry, Moe . ..” you will say ”Curly.” However, to go from priest to Levite to Samaritan is like going from Larry to Moe to Osama bin Laden. That analogy leads us to the second misreading. The parable is often seen as a story of how the oppressed minority    immigrants, gay people, people on parole    are ”nice” and therefore we should check our prejudices. Samaritans, then, were not the oppressed minority: They were the enemy. We know this not only from the historian Josephus, but also from Luke the evangelist. Just one chapter before our parable, Jesus seeks lodging in a Samaritan village, but they refuse him hospitality. Moreover, Samaria had another name: Shechem. At Shechem, Jacob’s daughter Dinah is raped or seduced by the local prince. At Shechem, the murderous judge Abimelech is based. We are the person in the ditch, and we see the Samaritan. Our first thought: ”He’s going to rape me. He’s going to murder me.” Then we realize: Our enemy may be the very person who will save us. Indeed, if we simply ask ”where is Samaria today?” we can see the import of this parable for the   crisis. The ’Parable of the Laborers in the Vineyard’ This parable tells the story of a series of workers who come in at different points of the day, but the owner pays them all the same amount. The parable is sometimes read with an   lens, so that the   are the ”Jews” who resent the gentiles or the sinners entering into God’s vineyard. Nonsense again. Jesus’ first listeners heard not a parable about salvation in the afterlife but about economics in present. They heard a lesson about how the employed must speak on behalf of those who lack a daily wage. They also discovered a prompt for people with resources: Attend to those who do not have jobs, and make sure everyone has what is needed. Jesus does not invent this idea of advocating for the unemployed and sharing resources. The same concerns occur in Jewish tradition from King David onward. But, unless we know the biblical and historical sources, again we will mishear the parable. The ’Parable of the Pearl of Great Price’ This parable describes a man who sells everything in order to obtain his prized pearl. It is usually allegorized to tell us about the centrality of faith, or the church, or Jesus, or the Kingdom of Heaven. But commentators cannot conclude what the pearl represents. Perhaps they are looking in the wrong place. We don’t recognize the parable’s initial absurdity today    the merchant (a wholesaler who sells us what we don’t need at a price we cannot afford) sells everything he has for a pearl. He can’t eat it, or sit on it it will not cover much if it’s all he wears. But, he thinks this pearl will fulfill him. What if the parable challenges us to determine our own pearl of great price? If we know our ultimate concern, we should be less acquisitive. We won’t sweat the small stuff. More, we become better able to love our neighbors, because we will know what is most important to them. Jesus’ short stories provoke us because they tell us what, somehow, we already know to be true, but don’t want to acknowledge. I am not a Christian, but I hear profound messages in these parables. If I as an outsider can be so moved by Jesus’ stories, surely people who worship him as Lord and Savior can appreciate them even more.

Sevens side caps stellar weekend for English rugby,CNN,"By George Ramsay, for CNN",2017-03-13," (CNN) As weekends go, it was a pretty good one for English rugby. A   18th consecutive win for the test side, a   hammering of Scotland for the women’s team, and to cap it all off, victory at the Rugby Sevens World Series event in Vancouver, Canada.  England’s   defeat of South Africa in Sunday’s final means Simon Amor’s side is still the only team to overcome the Blitzboks this season, having also beaten the men in green in the Cape Town title match. ”We’ve played well at times this season and haven’t come away with wins so it’s nice to get reward for our efforts,” said England’s speedster Dan Norton, who now shares first place on the   world series try list after going over the white line in Vancouver for the 244th time of his career. ”We’ve still got a way to go on the series so we will cherish this moment but know we have to keep pushing for (the next tournament in) Hong Kong,” Norton added. ”We fought hard over the week and it wasn’t the prettiest at times but we knew if we scrapped for everything over the two days we could be in with a chance.” The victory means England climbs to second in the overall standings on 103 points, though South Africa still holds a commanding   lead in the series.

A gritty   win over New Zealand in the quarterfinals was followed by a record   victory against Olympic champion Fiji    arguably the crowning performance of the weekend    as Norton crossed for two of England’s six tries.

Rugby Sevens: Blitzboks hit Vegas jackpot,CNN,"George Ramsay,",2017-03-06," (CNN) South Africa’s Blitzboks hit the jackpot in rugby sevens party capital Las Vegas as they secured a fourth victory in five HSBC Sevens World Series events. The men in green are the side to beat in this year’s series and Sunday’s triumph means they now command a   lead atop the overall standings, adding to wins in Wellington, Sydney and Dubai.  ”We’re happy with how it’s been going the last few tournaments and the guys are believing in a system and working for each other,” said head coach Neil Powell. After conceding an early try against Fiji in Sunday’s closely fought final, Powell’s side rallied to win   with tries from player of the tournament Rosco Specman, Cecil Afrika and Chris Dry. ”They are showing a lot of pride in the jersey and the fact that they can play for their country,” Powell added. ”They showed a lot of composure in the final and managed to take back control in the second half.” READ: Las Vegas    bright lights and natural beauty, READ: Six Nations calls for promotion and relegation, READ: Rugby’s concussion headache, ’Lucky number 11’ Specman, who scored five tries and made as many clean breaks in Vegas, said he felt he had big shoes to fill as the replacement for Seabelo Senatla. The legendary speedster recently switched to   rugby after setting the series alight as the top try scorer. ”I think maybe it’s lucky number 11,” said Specman. ”I am wearing the shirt from Seabelo, maybe it is giving me that little bit of extra speed!”  If the    was gifted with an extra yard of pace then it was certainly put to use in the final as he showed a clean pair of heels to tear away from the Fijian defense and score his side’s third try. Yet the Vegas event was by no means a walk in the park for the Blitzboks. The path to the final involved narrow victories over home favorites USA ( )    who eventually finished third     in the semifinals, and Australia ( ) in the quarters. With 107 points at the midpoint of the World Series, the Blitzboks are on course to win their first ever championship title.  Reaching the final means Fiji leapfrogs England into second place, but the Olympic champion    yet to win a tournament this season    still has a way to go before bridging the healthy gap held by South Africa.  In the women’s series, New Zealand emerged convincing winner in the final, beating Olympic champion Australia  .

Trump’s make-or-break day on health care,CNN,MJ Lee,2017-03-21,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump is in full   mode.  In the single biggest political test of his presidency thus far, Trump is looking to carry the Obamacare repeal and replace bill across the finish line.  Moment of truth looms for Freedom Caucus  He made a blunt pitch to House Republicans in a   meeting Tuesday morning on Capitol Hill: You could lose   if you don’t vote for this legislation.  It was clear, lawmakers said, that Trump was energized by the supporters that had come out for him Monday night in Louisville, Kentucky, as he described the ”huge” size of the crowds. That support may not last, he warned. ”We won’t have these crowds if we don’t get this done,” Trump said, according to a source in the room.  He later added: ”I honestly think many of you will lose your seats in 2018 if you don’t get this done.” According to CNN’s ongoing whip count, 19 House Republicans have said they will vote against the bill, while seven more have indicated they are likely to oppose it. GOP leaders can afford to lose 21 members to pass the bill without any Democratic support. What’s inside the Republican health care bill? A senior House leadership aide said they are confident they will get the votes, and that House Speaker Paul Ryan is ”full involved.” ”This is an    deck situation. This is a big bill. It’s a big promise Republicans made to the American people,” the aide said. The next 48 hours will reveal if Trump’s personal lobbying and efforts by Ryan and others will be enough. Conservative Republicans have emerged among the most fierce critics of leadership’s health care bill. Believing that the proposal doesn’t go far enough in dismantling the Affordable Care Act, they’ve dubbed the bill ”Obamacare Lite.” Trump has been holding smaller sessions with members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, whose chairman has opposed the bill.  In Tuesday’s   GOP meeting, Trump specifically called out Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows, saying he thinks both Meadows and the group will get on board. ”A loss just isn’t acceptable,” Trump said, according to a source in the room.  The President also said if the Freedom Caucus members don’t come along they could face tough primary challenges. These threats    described by members as having been delivered in good humor    were not enough to sway Meadows.  ”If this was about the President, I would have changed a long time ago,” Meadows said. Trump’s charm, Despite the dire warning about 2018, members leaving the gathering described what they said was vintage Trump    exuberant, humorous and ready to charm.  ”Trump was first rate in every way,” said GOP Rep. Tom Cole, a leadership ally. ”He was truly spectacular. This is part of the job that he enjoys and excels at    closing the deal.” GOP Rep. Richard Hudson described Trump’s visit as a ”  .” ”He was charming. He was funny. He really did a great job, I think, in letting us know we’re in this together,” Hudson said. ”He’s counting on us to vote for this bill.” Trump’s political message, Hudson said, was ”the American people are watching. They gave us the House, the Senate the White House and if you squander this opportunity I think there will be real consequences for you and the rest of the party.” Texas Republican Rep. Roger Williams, who said he has been ”an undecided all along,” told CNN after the meeting that he is now ”leaning yes” on the GOP health care bill.  ”I want this president to succeed and I think America does too, and I’m going to do everything I can to help him,” Williams said. ”This is big moment in the history of our country to dismantle this horrible Obamacare.”  Rep. Darrell Issa, who recently said the legislation was ”not in a form I can approve of,” said Tuesday that he, too, was leaning yes. Some of his main concerns about the bill were addressed in changes proposed in recent days, the California Republican said.  Others still remain opposed.  In a statement after the Trump meeting, GOP Rep. Ted Budd came out against the legislation.  ”This bill leaves the structure of Obamacare in place and does not provide the relief that North Carolina families need from high premiums,” Budd said. ”I am completely committed to repealing Obamacare and do not think that Congress should take a recess until we have done so.”   Late Monday, House leadership announced a set of moderate changes to their health care bill meant to reassure both conservatives and moderates who have a distinct set of concerns about the legislation.  White House press secretary Sean Spicer said more changes could be on the way. ”It’s possible,” Spicer said. ”I think we’ve made some very positive steps forward, so I don’t want to, you know, rule anything out but I will say that I feel very good about this where it stands now.” He added: ”The more and more members meet with the President, the more they understand how important this is to the overall agenda.” Nervousness on CBO score, Meanwhile, there is nervous energy among moderate Republicans who fear the political optics of the Congressional Budget Office’s assessment that millions more would be uninsured under the GOP bill than under Obamacare.  CBO report: 24 million fewer insured by 2026 under GOP health care bill, In advance of Trump’s arrival Tuesday morning, Ryan walked members through the changes unveiled Monday, according to a source inside the meeting. His pitch was this was as much as they could do to mollify as many concerns as they could, at this point in the process. He also made clear the reality of their situation: every change in one direction upsets those on the other side of things, so it’s a delicate balance, the source said.

Clinton hails ’courageous’ Martin McGuinness,CNN,Ben Westcott,2017-03-21," (CNN) Former US President Bill Clinton has led tributes to Martin McGuinness, describing the former Irish Republican Army commander and Deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland who died on Monday as ”courageous.” McGuinness became Sinn Fein’s chief negotiator during the Northern Ireland peace process, working with Clinton on the 1998 Good Friday Agreement. He died on Monday night after a short illness, according to a statement released by the Sinn Fein party. He was 66. ”When he decided to fight for peace, Martin was calm, courageous, and direct,” Clinton and former US Secretary of State, Hillary, said in a statement. ”And when he gave his word, that was as good as gold. As Sinn Fein’s chief negotiator, his integrity and willingness to engage in principled compromise were invaluable in reaching the Good Friday Agreement. ”My lasting memory of him will be the pride he took in his efforts to improve disadvantaged schools in Unionist and Protestant communities. He believed in a shared future, and refused to live in the past, a lesson all of us who remain should learn and live by. May he rest in peace.” McGuinness died less than three months after resigning as Deputy First Minister, sparking an election and threatening Northern Ireland’s fragile   arrangement. He retired from politics on January 19, 2017, saying his health had been deteriorating. In a statement, Sinn Fein described him as a man of ”great determination, dignity and humility.” ”He was a passionate republican who worked tirelessly for peace and reconciliation and for the   of his country. But above all he loved his family and the people of Derry and he was immensely proud of both,” Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams said in a statement. Under their tribute, Sinn Fein wrote in Irish, ”I measc laochra na nGael go raibh a anam dílis,” which translates as ”May he rest in peace in the presence of Irish heroes.” He is survived by his wife Bernie and four children. ’I am an Irish Republican’ McGuinness grew up in Derry, the epicenter of ”The Troubles,” Northern Ireland’s decades’ long sectarian conflict. About 3, 500 people were killed during the Troubles, a conflict between Catholic Irish nationalists, who wanted to join the Republic of Ireland, and Protestants who wished to remain part of the United Kingdom. It ran for three decades up until the Good Friday peace agreement in 1998. Even McGuinness’s place of birth is a question of politics    the nationalists call it Derry while the unionists refer to it as Londonderry. Despite working with the UK government for peace in Ireland, McGuinness remained opposed to British rule in Northern Ireland until the end of his life. ”I am an Irish republican,” he told CNN’s Nic Robertson. ”An Irish republican is someone who believes that the British government should have no part to play in the life of this island. We believe this island should be free.” McGuinness and Britain’s Queen Elizabeth II made history in 2012 when they shook hands during her visit to Northern Ireland, a symbol of repairing relations between the United Kingdom and the province. The Queen, whose cousin, the Earl of Mountbatten, was killed by an IRA blast in 1979, sent a private message of condolence to McGuinness’s widow, a Buckingham Palace spokesperson told CNN. Many   politicians in the UK and Ireland were also quick to offer their condolences. Irish President Michael Higgins said in a statement that McGuinness’s passing left a gap that would be ”difficult to fill.” ”The world of politics and the people across this island will miss the leadership he gave, shown most clearly during the difficult times of the peace process, and his commitment to the values of genuine democracy that he demonstrated,” he said. Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who was in Downing Street at the time of the Good Friday Agreement was signed in 1998, said peace in Northern Ireland would not have been possible without McGuinness. ”Once he became the peace maker, he became it wholeheartedly,” Blair said in a statement. Blair added: ”I will remember him therefore with immense gratitude for the part he played in the peace process and with genuine affection for the man I came to know and admire for his contribution to peace.” British Prime Minister Theresa May said McGuinness made an ”essential and historic contribution to the extraordinary journey of Northern Ireland from conflict to peace.” Kyle Paisley, son of former Northern Ireland First Minister Ian Paisley, who McGuinness served alongside as Deputy First Minister, said on Twitter that McGuinness had shown care towards his father when he was suffering ill health. ”Look back with pleasure on the remarkable year he and my father spent in office together and the great good they did,” he wrote.  ”Will never forget his ongoing care for my father in his ill health.”  ’Cowardice’ McGuinness’s death also drew comment from those who refused to recognize his move from paramilitary to politician. Norman Tebbit was buried beneath the rubble of the Grand Hotel in Brighton when the IRA bombed the Conservative Party Conference in 1984 in an audacious attempt to assassinate then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Five people were killed and 34 were injured, including Tebbit’s wife, Margaret, who was paralyzed from the waist down when the bomb went off on October 12. Lord Tebbit, who was then trade secretary,  said he was never convinced by McGuinness’s move into politics. ”He (McGuinness) did have an important role in the peace negotiations but that was not because he had changed his mind,” Tebbit told CNN. ”He was aware that the Army intelligence services had infiltrated the IRA right up at the top of the Army Council and that the IRA was defeated.  ”He had to get something out of defeat because apart from anything else, he would have been charged with the terrorist murder of which he was guilty.  ”It was an act of cowardice, not of principle. If anyone thinks that terrorists suddenly become nice Christian gentlemen then that would be a terrible mistake.” Brexit almost delivers for McGuinness, McGuinness may have passed away within striking distance of his most closely held wish    a unified Ireland. In the recent UK referendum on Europe, a majority of Northern Ireland voters chose to remain within the European Union.  Among their concerns was the state of the border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, currently governed by a common travel area which allows free travel between the two countries.  It was a key part of the Northern Ireland peace deal but under the UK government’s Brexit white paper, Downing Street only said it would ”aim” to protect the open border. McGuinness’ Sinn Fein party called for a referendum on Irish unity in the wake of Brexit, which would take Northern Ireland out of the United Kingdom. Speaking at a news conference in Derry, Michelle O’Neill, Sinn Fein leader in Northern Ireland, paid tribute to an ”international statesman.” ”He was a man that was recognized as a peacemaker and a man that touched the lives of so many people,” she said."

London attack: 4 killed in British Parliament carnage,CNN,Angela Dewan,2017-03-22,"London (CNN) Four people were killed and scores injured when an attacker plowed a car through crowds in central London before attempting to storm the Houses of Parliament in what police believe was an act of   terrorism. Police indicated they knew the identity of the assailant, who fatally stabbed unarmed police officer Keith Palmer, a    on the grounds of Parliament after ramming a car onto the crowded sidewalks nearby. Armed officers shot the attacker dead. It was the first   terrorist attack in Britain since 2005 when 52 people and four attackers died in the July 7 bomb attacks on the London public transportation system. The use of a vehicle as a weapon of terror echoed the methods used in the past year by attackers in Nice and Berlin. The London assault, which came on the   anniversary of the ISIS bomb attacks in Brussels, brought carnage to Westminster, the heart of political life in Britain. London attack part of disturbing trend, Prime Minister Theresa May described the attack as ”sick and depraved.” She said attempts to defeat through violence the values Parliament represents would be ”doomed to failure.” ”The location of this attack was no accident. The terrorist chose to strike at the heart of our capital city, where people of all nationalities, religions and cultures come together to celebrate the values of liberty, democracy and freedom of speech,” she said. Parliament was placed on lockdown for several hours and lawmakers were forced to remain in the main debating chamber of the House of Commons as officers rushed to the scene outside. Pictures showed scenes of carnage in the aftermath of the attack, which happened as Parliament was in session. One member of the British government gave    resuscitation to the officer who died from stab wounds. ’ ’ Mark Rowley, Britain’s most senior counterterror police officer, told reporters late Wednesday that authorities believe they know the attacker’s identity but are not releasing it, and are operating on the assumption the incident was ”  terrorism.” ”This is a day that we had planned for    that we all hoped would never happen    but sadly it is now a reality,” said Rowley, acting deputy commissioner of the Metropolitan Police. He said Palmer, 48, was a father and a husband. Rowley said 40 people were hurt.  Incident began near Westminster Bridge, The area around Westminster was teeming with people when the attack began at about 2:40 p. m. Witnesses said the attacker drove his car over Westminster Bridge and into the crowds. The vehicle hit a large number of people, including three police officers. ”The car then crashed near to Parliament and at least one man    armed with a knife    continued the attack, trying to enter Parliament,” said Rowley. One of those who died was a woman, he said.  Proceedings in the House of Commons were suspended, with dozens of MPs locked inside. Police put the Westminster area on lockdown, securing roads, Parliament buildings and the Westminster underground station. The zone was soon expanded to a larger part of central London, including the London Eye Ferris wheel, which was halted for hours with people still on it. They have since been let off.   The London Ambulance Service treated at least 10 patients on Westminster Bridge. In the chaos, a woman was pulled from the River Thames alive, but with serious injuries. London Mayor Sadiq Khan said: ”My heart goes out to those who have lost loved ones and to everyone who has been affected,” he said, paying tribute to the emergency services. He announced the deployment of additional armed officers on the streets of the British capital. ”We stand together in the face of those who would seek to harm us and destroy our way of life,” he added. ”Londoners will never be cowed by terrorism.” Police appealed for anyone with photos or video of the incident to contact them. The Prime Minister called a meeting of COBRA, the UK’s emergency Cabinet committee. US President Donald Trump spoke with May on the phone after learning of the attack, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said.   Mark Toner, acting spokesman for the US State Department, said officials were closely following the situation. ”Our hearts go out to those affected. We stand ready to assist in any way the UK authorities would find helpful,” he said. Eyewitnesses report chaotic scenes  People were photographed running in a panic from the scene, while witnesses told CNN they saw the car plow through a crowd.  Robyn Lyon, 34, from Rugby, said he was walking along Westminster Bridge. ”I saw a car, the crunch of car, hitting the curb. I kind of thought the guy had maybe had a heart attack or something,” he said.   ”The accelerator suddenly picked up so you had that revving. I expected it to hit the bridge wall and then stop, and then turn back carry up the pavement. It hit several people. I jumped out the way into a road. ”I stood in shock and saw carnage around me and the car carrying on up the bridge.” Another witness, Radek Sikorski, said he saw one of the victims bleeding heavily from the head and another lying unconscious.  Richard Poet, 62, who was visiting London from Brighton and his partner were leaving the Tate Britain gallery when he heard ”great crashes.” ”I thought it was a wrecking ball. It didn’t sound like guns or anything.” Craig Meichan, 20, a student from Ormskirk near Liverpool, was on a field trip with around 15 others and had left Parliament just a moment before. He was shaking as he told CNN his party was separated into three groups. ”It sounded like a car backfiring, police began shouting and they started cordoning off the area,” he said, adding that he believed his tutor was still locked inside.  ”I’m a bit shaken up, you never expect this to happen to you. When it does it’s an indescribable feeling.” Chaos in Parliament  As the incident unfolded outside, the Leader of the House of Commons, David Lidington, told MPs a serious incident had taken place ”within the estate.” Proceedings were suspended. Lidington told MPs that it appeared a police officer has been stabbed and that the assailant had been shot. Conservative MP Damian Collins told CNN that he was walking through an underground tunnel from his office to vote in the chamber with about 30 other MPs when he heard shouting followed by gunshots. Police shouted for the MPs to get down on the ground. ”Clearly, something serious had happened but no one was being told what was going on,” he said.  ”The instant response from the police was incredible    they seemed on top of the situation straight away.” Chris Doyle, Director of Council for   Understanding, who was at a restaurant at Parliament at the time, described a moment of sudden panic.  ”We were in the terrace restaurant when there was a series of panicked male shouts. Everyone started getting under tables. Under the sofa by me was a small child. Only after several minutes did people get up. It became clear it was the police,” he said.  ”We still did not know what had happened, if there was a bomb, a gunman a fire. The police directed everyone    MPs, Lords, cooks, waiters, visitors and schoolchildren    to the central lobby. Members of parliament were locked in and asked to keep away from windows.  Hundreds were later evacuated from the Parliament buildings after hours locked inside. Labour MP Barry Sheerman posted an image on Twitter showing lawmakers in the House in the evening with food and drink. Member of Parliament gives assistance,  A member of the government, Foreign Office Minister Tobias Ellwood, was pictured giving assistance to a victim in New Palace Yard, a courtyard within the grounds of Parliament. A fellow Conservative Party MP,  Maria Miller said he had ”given    resuscitation to one victim,” the Press Association said. A witness told CNN that Ellwood was trying to save the police officer, who died.  Eyewitness Hugh Dickinson, a    student from High Wycombe, posted a picture of the minister on Twitter, showing the minister bleeding, but saying ”he looked to be fine.”  Editor’s note: This story has been updated to reflect the latest number of fatalities from London Metropolitan Police."
Manafort pushes back on report he worked to help Putin’s government,CNN,Jeremy Diamond,2017-03-22,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump’s former campaign chief Paul Manafort pushed back Wednesday on a report that he allegedly earned millions of dollars by helping Russian President Vladimir Putin’s government push its interests around the world. Manafort confirmed that he worked for Oleg Deripaska, a Russian billionaire with close ties to Putin, but rejected an Associated Press report alleging that work was aimed at furthering the political interests of Putin’s government. ”I worked with Oleg Deripaska almost a decade ago representing him on business and personal matters in countries where he had investments. My work for Mr. Deripaska did not involve representing Russian political interests,” Manafort said in a statement his spokesman provided to CNN. He issued another statement on the matter Wednesday afternoon: ”I have always publicly acknowledged that I worked for Mr. Deripaska and his company, Rusal, to advance its interests. For example, one of the projects involved supporting a referendum in Montenegro that allowed that country to choose membership in the (European Union) a measure that Russia opposed. I did not work for the Russian government. Once again, smear and innuendo are being used to paint a false picture. I look forward to meeting with those conducting serious investigations of these issues to discuss the actual facts.” Manafort was referring to the 2006 referendum that resulted in Montenegro’s independence from Serbia and Montenegro, which set the country on a more   path.  A spokesman for Deripaska told CNN on Wednesday that Manafort provided ”investment consulting services” but declined to provide any additional details. ”There was an agreement between Mr. Deripaska and Mr. Manafort to provide investment consulting services related to business interests of Mr. Deripaska which now is a subject to legal claims,” the spokesman said in a statement. The Associated Press reported Wednesday that Manafort pitched a plan to Deripaska to ”greatly benefit the Putin government” and was subsequently paid millions of dollars, according to business records obtained by the AP and interviews the news outlet conducted with sources familiar with the matter. It is just the latest report pointing to a link between Manafort and Russian interests. Before he was brought aboard the Trump campaign, Manafort was well known for having served as an adviser to Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, who was close to Putin and fled to Russia after he was ousted in the 2014 political crisis. Manafort was later named in a Ukrainian government investigation last summer after a ledger detailed millions of dollars in secret payments to Manafort, which he denied. Manafort’s connections to Russia faced fresh scrutiny last month after current and former US officials told CNN that   Trump campaign advisers, including Manafort, regularly communicated with Russians known to US intelligence. Manafort called the allegation ”100% not true” and said he didn’t ”remember talking to any Russian officials, ever.” White House press secretary Sean Spicer on Wednesday said Trump ”did not know” of Manafort’s work as disclosed in the AP report. ”I think nothing in this morning’s report references any actions by the President, the White House or any Trump administration official,” Spicer said during the White House briefing. Spicer rejected the notion that Trump should have known about the work, asking in return whether Trump should have known who Manafort ”played with in the sandbox.” That came two days after Spicer sought to diminish Manafort’s role in the campaign, claiming he played a ”limited role” even though Manafort was campaign chairman and effectively took over as campaign manager after the firing of Trump’s first campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski. Manafort worked on the campaign from March until August 2016. ”To start to look at some individual that was there for a short period of time, or, separately, individuals who really didn’t play any role in the campaign, and to suggest that those are the basis for anything is a bit ridiculous,” Spicer said Monday during a White House briefing. The Associated Press report comes days after FBI Director James Comey confirmed in testimony to Congress that his agency is investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 campaign and potential ties between Trump campaign associates and the Russian government.  Sen. Susan Collins,   said Wednesday that the new reports about Manafort are likely to be reviewed by the Senate Intelligence Committee. ”I definitely do have concerns about that news report,” Collins told CNN. ”I don’t know what the evidence is and I think it’s really important that we look at the evidence and do so aggressively. We need to follow the evidence wherever it leads.” And Virginia Democratic Sen. Mark Warner, the vice chairman of the committee, told CNN’s Erin Burnett Tuesday that ”we’re going to need to bring (Manafort) in” to discuss connections between the Trump campaign and Russia. A cloud of suspicion has hung over Trump since the US government confirmed that the Russian government interfered in the presidential election with the aim of hurting Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and helping Trump. During the campaign, Trump called for a friendlier relationship with Russia, defended Putin from human rights abuse allegations and repeatedly cast doubt on US government conclusions of Russian interference during the campaign and after his election. Anthony Scaramucci, a hedge fund manager who served on Trump’s national finance committee during Manafort’s tenure at the helm, said he has ”a lot of respect” for Manafort and said he believed Manafort’s denial. ”I take Paul at his word that he was working on business interests for Oleg and it wasn’t tied to the Russian government,” Scaramucci said Wednesday on CNN’s ”New Day.” "
Cut it out: Canadian diplomats told to stop using Justin Trudeau cutouts,CNN,Doug Criss,2017-03-22," (CNN) Everybody loves Justin Trudeau. He’s good looking. And hip. And cool. The Canadian Prime Minster draws a crowd wherever he goes, even if it’s just a cardboard cutout of him. But not anymore.  Canada’s diplomats here in the US have been told to stop using cutouts of Trudeau at embassy and consulate events. Why? Maybe because it costs Canadian taxpayers a little bit of money. But let’s back up a bit. The cutouts appeared last year at Canada Day events at Canada’s embassy in Washington and its consulate in Atlanta, CNN partner CBC News reports. A cardboard Trudeau popped up just last week at a Canadian tourism booth at South by Southwest in Austin, Texas. But members of Canada’s Conservative Party did some research and found out that the embassy had ordered up a Trudeau cutout from a Pennsylvania company at a cost of almost $150. They were more than happy to alert the media about this. So Global Affairs Canada, the government entity in charge of the nation’s embassies and consulates, ordered diplomats to cut it out. Perfect metaphor? ”We are aware of instances where our missions in the United States had decided to purchase and use these cutouts,” a Global Affairs Canada spokesman told CBC News. ”The missions have been asked to no longer use these for their events.” One Conservative lawmaker said that a cutout is ”a perfect metaphor” for Trudeau, who is also leader of Canada’s Liberal Party. ”You’ve got the shallow facade, and yet there’s very little in the way of depth or substance there,” he said. So instead of talking selfies with the cardboard version of the Prime Minister, Trudeau fans will have to wait    and try to get a picture with the real thing."
"While partisans fight, Gorsuch glides through hearings Day 3",CNN,Ashley Killough,2017-03-22," (CNN) Neil Gorsuch finished his final day of testimony Wednesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee, facing tough questions from Democrats on the panel without ever hinting how he might rule on   issues. Fireworks instead were more prevalent between Republicans and Democrats on the committee, who lobbed accusations against each other of politicizing the Supreme Court nomination process. Gorsuch, however, came out of the gauntlet with barely a scratch. Democrats poked and prodded, attempting to get a better understanding of his personal views and how they would affect his potential court rulings. But the    federal judge was unwavering, yielding little fodder that could derail his nomination. Even one of his fiercest Democratic questioners on the committee seemed to suggest Gorsuch’s confirmation was inevitable. ”This is probably the last time you’ll pay attention to me,” Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse,   Island said. ”I am not likely to appear before the court unless things should change fairly dramatically. I have argued in the Supreme Court, but some time ago.” Though Gorsuch did well in the hearings, it doesn’t necessarily mean he won over his critics. It’s unclear yet how things will shake out in the full Senate after Gorsuch gets a committee vote.  Democrats on the panel expressed great frustration with Gorsuch, saying he was not being forthcoming enough in his answers. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, for one, said at the end that he ”remained troubled” by Gorsuch not revealing his views about certain cases. Sen. Mazie Hirono told Gorsuch she wished the hearing had been more ”illuminating,” saying she’s left to judge his qualifications based on what he ”refused to say.”   RELATED: Gorsuch forced to defend decision in frozen trucking case, Still, the hearings went into a third round Wednesday night, but Republicans gave back most of their time and even some Democrats gave back some of their allotted 15 minutes. Audience seats were   by then    and the hearing didn’t see one protester all week.  It was yet another sign that Gorsuch’s nomination could potentially avoid a     brawl in the Senate. Republicans have 52 senators, and need the support of eight Democrats to avoid a filibuster in the full Senate.  The Republican National Committee announced a   ad buy targeting 12 Democratic senators from mostly states that President Donald Trump won, in part urging voters to call their senators and demand an    vote for Gorsuch in the Senate.   Sen. Joe Manchin, one of those Democrats, stopped by the hearing Wednesday afternoon. The West Virginia senator said he’s still keeping an open mind and requested a second meeting with Gorsuch next week.  Manchin said Gorsuch was ”pretty solid” from what he saw in the hearings and offered some tough love for some of his Democratic colleagues when it comes to considering the Supreme Court pick.  ”I need to tell them every now and then that we lost, the Democrats lost the presidential election. You’re not going to get someone of your preference,” he said. ”You get someone you can live with and someone who has good character and good stature    and can you go that direction? Does that prevent the   threshold to be broken? There’s a lot of considerations there.” While Gorsuch is finished with appearing before the committee, witnesses will testify on his behalf before the committee on Thursday.  Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley announced he expects the committee will vote on Gorsuch’s nomination April 3. The nominee himself    who remained steadfastly polite throughout the hearings    interrupted the final round of questions to ask if he could say his ”thank yous” before any senators had to leave early. Gorsuch recalled individual meetings he held with 72 senators over the past six weeks and thanked the lawmakers for their ”courtesies.” ”I wish the American people could see what I’ve seen,” he said. ”I think that if they had seen what I’ve seen, they’d be much bigger believers in their government than they are. It’s not perfect, my branch isn’t perfect, but I’m a believer in it and I want to thank you.” Republicans, Democrats square off  Gorsuch faced long days of grilling    including an   hearing on Tuesday    answering questions on a range of issues, from his previous rulings to the President’s attacks on the judiciary. While tense exchanges between Gorsuch and Democrats were minimal, Democrats still grew irritated by his refusal to opine on certain issues.  Democrats also hammered Republicans for blocking a vote on President Barack Obama’s nominee to the Supreme Court last year so they could keep the seat open until a new president was inaugurated. It was a topic that came up throughout the week, with one senator   telling Gorsuch he thought Merrick Garland was more qualified than Gorsuch. Republicans, in turn, accused their Democratic colleagues of applying a double standard, saying they’ve been quick to criticize Gorsuch    a federal judge    yet at the same time condemn Trump’s attacks on federal judges    something Democrats did repeatedly when trying to get Gorsuch to comment on the President’s rhetoric.  Sen. Ted Cruz,   used a chunk of his time Wednesday to read off a list of attacks against Gorsuch by   Democrats, including some on the committee. ”My colleagues, the Democrats, have a right to engage in whatever attacks they chose. But it’s a little rich for them to be maligning a sitting federal judge and at the same time giving speeches about how unacceptable it is for anyone to criticize a federal judge,” he said. ”You can’t have both at the same time.”  Sen. Mike Lee,   clarified that he wasn’t defending Trump’s attacks, but said he found Democrats’ rhetoric about Gorsuch’s previous rulings ”ironic” and ”quite troubling.” Sen. Ben Sasse,   called it ”absurd.” Earlier Wednesday, Sen. Lindsey Graham,   Carolina, bemoaned that the confirmation process has become too politicized and specifically targeted Democrats for trying to get Gorsuch to state his personal views. ”What’s happened? Did the Constitution change? I don’t think so. I think politics has changed. I think it’s changed in a fashion that we should all be ashamed of as senators, and I think we’re doing great damage to the judiciary by politicizing every judicial nomination,” he said. ’I expect judicial decrees to be obeyed’ Gorsuch throughout the week sought to paint himself as a fair and independent judge, walking a delicate line of trying to answer questions without tipping his hand. If confirmed, Gorsuch will fill the seat vacated by the late Justice Antonin Scalia, who passed away a little more than a year ago. Though Gorsuch had deep admiration for Scalia, his attempts to stay independent meant keeping his distance from the former justice at times. Sen. Patrick Leahy, who said Scalia was ”intelligent” and a friend, asked Gorsuch if he agreed with Scalia’s comment that the 2013 renewal of the Voting Rights Act was a ”perpetuation of racial entitlement.” Gorsuch did not give a direct answer. ”I don’t speak for Justice Scalia,” he said. ”I speak for myself.”  The nominee also repeatedly suggested he’d be willing to rule against the President, if necessary. Citing the Bush administration and torture, Leahy asked Gorsuch on Wednesday if he thinks there’s any circumstance in which a president can ignore a law on the books. ”I can’t think of one, offhand,” Gorsuch said. Leahy, a Democrat from Vermont, used his answer to transition to a question about the Trump administration. Without mentioning a name, Leahy referenced a quote by Trump adviser Stephen Miller on the President’s executive order banning immigration from six Muslim majority countries. Miller, around the time a federal court ruled against the ban earlier this year, stated that the President’s powers to protect the nation ”will not be questioned.” Reading the quote, Leahy asked Gorsuch if a president would have to comply with a court order. ”That’s the rule of law in this country,” Gorsuch said. ”I’m a judge now, and I take that seriously,” he added. ”And you better believe I expect judicial decrees to be obeyed.” ’Law of the land’  On the campaign trail, Trump said he would appoint a judge who would overturn the Supreme Court ruling legalizing abortion, Roe v. Wade, but Gorsuch said he was never asked during the selection process to make promises on certain decisions. Pressed on what he would have done if Trump had asked him to do so, Gorsuch said he ”would have walked out the door.” Gorsuch acknowledged that abortion came up once in a conversation with Trump, but he said it was in the context of saying many of his supporters were opposed to it. RELATED: Nuclear option   begins over Gorsuch vote, Later in the day, he appeared to give his clearest answer yet on abortion rights. Gorsuch was asked by Sen. Dick Durbin about a book he wrote on assisted suicide, which touched on the debate over when life begins. ”As the book explains, the Supreme Court of the United States has held in Roe v. Wade that a fetus is not a person for purposes of the 14th Amendment and the book explains that,” Gorsuch said. ”Do you accept that?” Durbin,   asked. ”That’s the law of the land, senator,” Gorsuch said. ”Yes.” Democrats seize on Supreme Court decision, Democrats pounced on the news that the Supreme Court Wednesday reversed an interpretation of a federal   statute that Gorsuch played a role in crafting. Chief Justice John Roberts explained that the federal appeals court in Denver had applied too strict a standard to claims by an autistic child’s parent that they were entitled to reimbursement for the cost of private education under the federal Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act (IDEA). The decision reversed Wednesday was by a different   panel (that didn’t include Gorsuch) of the same court on which he sits    but it relies largely on an earlier decision by the same court that Gorsuch wrote. Gorsuch’s interpretation was that if a school district satisfies federal law, it does not need to reimburse the cost of private education, so long as it provides educational benefits to disabled students that are ”more than de minimis.” In Wednesday’s opinion, the Supreme Court stressed that more was required by the federal statute. Democratic Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Durbin quizzed Gorsuch on his interpretation, with Klobuchar pointing out more than once that the Supreme Court was unanimous in its decision disagreeing with him. Gorsuch noted there was a circuit split on the standard, and argued he was trying to follow precedent as best he could. ”To suggest that we were in any way out of the mainstream or that I was doing anything unusual would be mistaken, because it’s the standard used by many circuits up until, I guess, today,” he said. Gorsuch said he finds it ”wonderfully reaffirming” that there’s a body like the Supreme Court that resolves situations like these in which federal courts disagree."
Paul: Bring Pence to Senate to repeal Obamacare,CNN,David Wright,2017-03-22,"Washington (CNN) Sen. Rand Paul on Wednesday backed a controversial method for passing Obamacare repeal that could dramatically change the way the Senate operates, if successful, but which faces long odds, even among Republicans.  The proposal    which has also drawn support from Sen. Ted Cruz    purports to ease passage of a more expansive Obamacare replacement bill by foregoing traditional Senate rules and seating Vice President Mike Pence as Senate chair for the vote.   Paul argued that with Pence as chair, he would be empowered to make decisions about what can be passed through budget reconciliation, a procedural distinction that has a simple   . That would allow Republicans to bypass the larger,   requirement that would otherwise be required to repeal and replace key components of the Affordable Care Act    a major roadblock. Paul    who opposes the current GOP health care bill moving through the House    said Wednesday on MSNBC’s ”Morning Joe” that leadership ”is afraid of the Senate parliamentarian. But we’ve read the rules, and it looks to us like the vice president can sit in the chair, and the vice president can decide for the Senate what is reconcilable.” He explained, ”the rules, the budget rules that everyone touts and are so arcane, they say the chair rules, and not the parliamentarian. The chair rules. The vice president has the prerogative of sitting in the chair, and if they want this done, the vice president should come to the Senate.” Paul’s proposal comes as Republicans are under growing pressure to pass an Obamacare repeal bill    but divisions within the party, a slim Senate majority, and legislative procedure have complicated those efforts.  Lacking large enough majorities in Congress to pass outright repeal, GOP leadership has sold Obamacare repeal and replacement as a   plan, with partial repeal now and other key changes left for later.  RELATED: The ’ ’ strategy on health care that not everyone can believe in, The problem is that many of those key changes that are left for later will still require 60 votes in the Senate, which could take multiple election cycles to achieve    something Paul’s proposal purports to solve.  On MSNBC, he said that phase three of leadership’s plan ”is never going to happen,” and argued that Republicans could instead achieve repeal and replace simultaneously with Pence, seated as Senate chair, declaring that a more expansive version of the bill is reconcilable.  Still, such a move would be a dramatic break from the way Senate rules have traditionally been observed, and could set an irrevocable precedent for legislating akin to ”nuking” the filibuster for some Senate nominees. Paul seemed to acknowledge that his proposal faced long odds. ”Do you believe that is something that could happen?” asked ”Morning Joe” host Willie Geist. ”Only if we have the guts to do it, and I don’t know if we have the guts to do it,” Paul replied.

Grieving father: ’I don’t play Trump songs anymore’,CNN,Elizabeth Cohen,2017-03-22," (CNN) Last year, Kraig Moss sold the equipment for his construction business in upstate New York and stopped making mortgage payments so he could follow Donald Trump on the campaign trail.  The amateur country crooner sang   ditties while strumming a guitar emblazoned with Trump campaign stickers, earning him the moniker ”Trump Troubadour.”  International media dubbed him ”the voice of unheard America.” But now, Moss refuses to play the guitar with the Trump decorations. He’s soured on the President because of the newly proposed Republican health care bill.  That legislation, which the president supports, could result in dramatic cuts in addiction treatment services.  Three years ago, Moss found his son, Rob, dead in his bed from a heroin overdose. He was 24.  ”The bill is an absolute betrayal of what Trump represented on the campaign trail,” he said. ”I feel betrayed.”  Moss feels it personally.  Last year, at a campaign rally in Iowa, Trump reached out and spoke directly to Moss about Rob’s death.  ”In all fairness to your son, it’s a tough thing. Some very, very strong people have not been able to get off (heroin),” Trump called out to Moss in the crowd. ”The biggest thing we can do in honor of your son . .. we have to be able to stop it.”  When Moss became emotional, Trump comforted him.  ”I know what you went through. And he’s a great father. I can see it. And your son is proud of you. Your son is proud of you,” Trump said. ”I’ll bet he was a great boy.”  Several times on the campaign trail, Trump vowed to increase services for people facing addiction.  ”We will help all of those people so seriously addicted. We’ll get them assistance,” he told the crowd at a campaign event in New Hampshire in October.  Moss trusted Trump.  ”I truly believe from the heart that (Trump) is going to do everything he can. He’s going to create treatment centers for the kids,” he said last year.  But last week, Moss read about the proposed American Health Care Act. The Republican bill would end the Obamacare requirement that addiction services and mental health treatment be covered under Medicaid in the 31 states that expanded the health care program    which include Moss’ home state of New York. ”This bill would devastate efforts to address the opioid crisis,” said Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, director of the Bloomberg American Health Initiative at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. ”There’s no question this legislation in the House of Representatives would cost American lives.” At a CNN town hall event last week, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price was asked about the bill’s provisions for opioid treatment.  He responded that state governors had ”wonderful ideas about how to address it” but that they felt ”hamstrung by the federal government.” ”There are wonderful ways if we keep the focus on the patient    not the government, but on the patient,” he said.  Moss looks back on his days on the campaign trail, on how he sold his trucks to finance the trip, how he sang his heart out and went from restaurant to restaurant to hand out ”Donald Trump for President” CDs.  ”I did a lot to promote his candidacy,” he said. ”Now, I wish I had never sold my equipment.”  But he doesn’t like to think about regrets. He’s looking to the future.  Earlier this month, more than 300 people showed up in   weather for a fundraiser Moss organized in his son’s memory.  He raised $3, 000 for a local drug treatment center, but he said the greatest gift of the evening was that people who’d lost loved ones to drug addiction came together and comforted one another.   ”We all felt less alone,” he said."
"Failed North Korean missile exploded ’within seconds,’ US says",CNN,Ben Westcott,2017-03-22," (CNN) A North Korean missile fired Wednesday exploded ”within seconds of launch,” according to US Pacific Command. US officials confirmed North Korea had attempted to launch a missile near Kalma, on the country’s east coast, but early reports suggest it failed. ”South Korea and the US are aware of the missile launch and to their knowledge North Korea’s missile was not successfully launched,” South Korea’s Ministry of Defense said in a statement. Neither the US nor South Korea have released information on what type of missile was fired, or why it failed. The US Pacific Command said it was working with partners to assess it further. At a daily press briefing Wednesday, China’s foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying again called on all parties on the Korean Peninsula, including South Korea and the United States, to ”exercise restraint.” ”The current situation on the peninsula is extremely tense    ’everyone with his dagger drawn’ would be a fair description,” she said. The attempted launch comes four days after the North Korea announced it had tested a new rocket engine, describing it as a ”great leap forward” in their missile program. US defense officials told CNN the engine could be used for a   intercontinental ballistic missile. North Korea’s ’signal’ to the South, Against the background of the launch, South Korea and the United States continued their annual ”Foal Eagle” military exercises, which often provoke retaliation from the North Koreans. The ”Foal Eagle” exercises began on March 1 and will end on April 30. Robert Kelly, associate professor of political science at Pusan National University, told CNN the latest launch was a ”signal” to South Korea from their northern neighbor. ”The North Koreans respond to (the drills) almost every year with some kind of outlash or provocation or something like that,” he said. ”Missile tests are a nice way to send a signal.” Speaking to reporters, Hua reiterated China’s proposal for an end to the   Korean drills in exchange for North Korea halting its nuclear program. ”We consider (the proposal) the only correct, fair and reasonable way out of the current dilemma . .. As the saying goes, ’let he who tied the bell on the tiger take it off’,” she said. Second launch in a month, It isn’t the North Korea’s first launch this month    the country fired four   ballistic missiles on March 6, which fell into waters off Japan.  Three of them landed less than 200 nautical miles off the Japanese coast, antagonizing the South Korean and Japanese governments. At the time, experts told CNN the rapid series of launches indicated North Korea was speeding up their weapons program, deploying and developing missiles faster. ”They did a launch (in February) they’re now launching more in 30 days. That’s a third of the time they used to need,” Carl Schuster, a professor at Hawaii Pacific University, told CNN at the time. In February, a senior Trump administration official told reporters the US President believed North Korea was the ”greatest immediate threat” to the United States. Kelly said the US was still struggling to find a way to rein in North Korea’s aggressive behavior. ”Ideally we’d find a diplomatic solution, but the North Koreans have to be willing to come around or the Chinese have to twist their arm and that’s what everyone is hoping,” he said. Recent failed missile tests, North Korea’s missile program may be accelerating quickly but there have been stumbles along the way, especially with its attempts to launch Musudan missiles. The Musudan is a   ballistic missile with a range of 2, 500 to 4, 000 kilometers (1, 500 to 2, 500 miles) far enough to reach Japan or Guam.  Two missiles, thought to be Musudans, failed to launch successfully within one week in October.  The previous June, of two missiles launched, one didn’t make it further than 150 kilometers (93 miles). The other flew 400 kilometers (250 miles) before falling into the Sea of Japan, also known as the East Sea, which North Korea claimed was a success. Still, both of those were more successful than North Korea’s launches earlier in 2016. In May, one Musudan flew for about two seconds before exploding, while an April launch was described by the Pentagon as a ”fiery, catastrophic failure,” according to CSIS. Even the four missiles launched this month, which North Korean leader Kim Jong Un appeared to celebrate in state media photos, didn’t go off without a hitch    a fifth missile failed to launch as planned.  At the time, a US official said the projectiles involved in that test were   SCUD missiles. Correction: This article has been corrected to refer to Hua Chunying as a foreign ministry spokeswoman."
Czech zoo cuts off horns to protect rhinos,CNN,,2017-03-22," (CNN) A zoo in the Czech Republic has begun removing the horns of all its rhinos, saying it is better to leave the animals with stumps than risk them being killed by poachers.  The move comes in response to an attack two weeks ago on Vince, a    Southern white rhino, at Thoiry Zoo in Paris. Vince was shot dead by poachers who sawed off one of his horns with a chainsaw. Fearing more attacks, Dvůr Králove Zoo in the northern Czech Republic will remove the horns of its 21 rhinoceroses, officials there said. Pamir, a Southern white rhino, on Monday became the first to lose his horn in a procedure carried out by a veterinarian under anesthetic. The decision to remove the horn was difficult and sad, Jan Stejskal, director of international projects at the zoo, told CNN. ”We understand it is a natural thing for a rhino to have horns,” he said. ”We would love to keep them untouched. I was there during the procedure on Monday, and emotionally I didn’t like it.” ”But it does not hurt the animal, and this is a necessary measure that can help us reduce risk,” he said. Paris attack stoked fear, ”We always knew something could happen, and we didn’t want to dehorn, but Thoiry happened, and it means many other people could get the same idea,” Stejskal said.  Zoo director Přemysl Rabas acknowledged the risk of complications as horns are surgically removed. The decision to dehorn was ”not made easily,” he said in a statement, but added that ”the dehorned rhino is definitely a better option than the dead rhino.”  Like hair and nails, horns are made of keratin, and removing them does not hurt, he said. Andrea Jiroušová, a spokeswoman for the Czech zoo, said the horns will grow back, on average about two centimeters a year. It’s not known when the procedure may need to be repeated, though officials hope circumstances improve so that such a radical step will not need to be taken again. Worldwide danger, All five rhino species are on the endangered list. They often are victims of poaching in the wild because some people believe their horns have medicinal properties. Horns can be sold on the black market for around $60, 000 per pound    more than gold, diamonds or cocaine.   Dehorning operations have taken place in parks and reserves in Africa    and another zoo in Europe, Pairi Daiza in Belgium, has also decided to take the drastic step following the Paris attack. All three of Pairi Daiza’s adult rhinos have undergone the procedure, spokeswoman Aleksandra Vidanovski told CNN. ”We have no intention of doing this regularly, but we will reevaluate the situation in due course.” Working with police, Though fear is raw following the Paris attack, the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria has not issued a ”blanket recommendation” for its 345 member institutions regarding rhinos, communications manager David   said, adding he is not aware of a   movement to dehorn rhinos across the continent.  The organization’s members are working closely with law enforcement agencies to prevent attacks, he said, and there is no evidence to suggest that poaching gangs plan to target other zoos."
Durbin: Gorsuch lacks necessary Democratic support,CNN,,2017-03-22," (CNN) Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin said Wednesday he does not believe Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch has the Democratic support necessary for confirmation in the Senate. Republicans have a   majority in the chamber. Sixty votes are needed to overcome a potential filibuster by Democrats. ”At this point, I don’t believe there are eight Democrats supporting Judge Gorsuch, but Chuck Schumer told us all, ’Wait until the hearings are over, let’s do this professionally, let’s do it responsibly,’” said Durbin, referring to the Senate minority leader. ”I think that’s the right approach.” If Gorsuch falls short with Democrats, Republicans could decide to invoke the ”nuclear option” requiring a simple majority. Some Republicans, however, fear such a maneuver could set a dangerous precedent for when they do not control the upper chamber.  RELATED: Neil Gorsuch faces third day before Congress, Sen. Lindsey Graham,   Carolina, didn’t address such concerns when he told Fox News Wednesday morning Gorsuch ”will be on the court, no matter what it takes.” Speaking with CNN anchor Chris Cuomo, Durbin also predicted Democrats’ further grilling of Gorsuch on Wednesday will yield key details that would determine the level of support he receives from Democrats. ”I can tell you this, today is another day of questioning, and I think there will be some important issues raised, but at the end of the day, we each have to make a decision as to whether this man should have a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court,” he said. ”It’s not an easy call because it’s the deciding vote in a   court.” As for how he plans to vote, Durbin said, ”I’ll withhold my final judgment until the hearings are over.” RELATED: Democrats are powerless to block Neil Gorsuch    but they still have a decision to make"
Scientology: What exactly is it?,CNN,Tricia Escobedo,2017-03-22," (CNN) Chances are    unless you live in Los Angeles     the only time you hear about Scientology is when it’s connected with a Hollywood celebrity.  Yet there’s a lot more to this religion than just its ties to Tinseltown.  Scientology is probably one of the most successful new American faiths to have emerged in the past century. But despite its success    and like a lot of other belief systems    what Scientologists believe and how they perceive a higher power is often misunderstood.  Religious scholar Reza Aslan explores the origin and central ideas of this faith on his CNN show, ”Believer.”  Here’s a look at the basics about Scientology: What is Scientology? Scientology describes itself as a religion that was founded in the 1950s by L. Ron Hubbard. At the core of Scientology is a belief that each human has a reactive mind that responds to life’s traumas, clouding the analytic mind and keeping us from experiencing reality. Members of the religion submit to a process called auditing to find the sources of this trauma, reliving those experiences in an attempt to neutralize them and reassert the primacy of the analytic mind, working toward a spiritual state called ”clear.” The process involves a device called   which Scientologists say measures the body’s electric flow as an auditor asks a series of questions they say reveals sources of trauma. ”Auditing uses processes   exact sets of questions asked or directions given by an auditor to help a person locate areas of spiritual distress, find out things about himself and improve his condition,” according to the Church of Scientology’s website. The church goes on to say, ”Science is something one does, not something one believes in.” Auditing purports to identify spiritual distress from a person’s current life and from past lives. Scientologists believe each person is an immortal being, a force that believers call a thetan.  ”You move up the bridge to freedom by working toward being an ’Operating Thetan,’ which at the highest level transcends material law,” says David Bromley, a professor of religious studies at Virginia Commonwealth University. ”You occasionally come across people in Scientology who say they can change the material world with their mind.” Bromley and other scholars say the church promotes the idea of an ancient intergalactic civilization in which millions of beings were destroyed and became what are known as ”body thetans,” which continue to latch onto humans and cause more trauma.  Advanced Scientologists confront body thetans through more auditing. Bromley says the church discloses that cosmic history only to more advanced Scientologists. The church’s media affairs department did not respond to requests for comment to this story. In a 2008 CNN interview, church spokesman Tommy Davis was asked whether the basic tenet of the Church of Scientology was to rid the body of space alien parasites.  ”Does that sound silly to you?” laughed Davis. ”I mean, it’s unrecognizable to me. . .. People should really come to the church and find out for themselves what it is.” Who was L. Ron Hubbard? L. Ron Hubbard was the founder of Scientology. Born in Nebraska in 1911, Hubbard was the son of a U. S. Navy officer who circled the globe with his family, according to Scientology expert J. Gordon Melton, a fellow at Baylor University’s Institute for Studies in Religion who writes about Scientology on the religion website Patheos. Hubbard attended the George Washington University in Washington, D. C. but left before graduating to launch a career as a fiction writer, gravitating toward science fiction. After serving in World War II, Hubbard published a series of articles and then a book on a what he described as a new approach to mental health, which he called Dianetics. His book by the same name quickly became a  . The success provoked Hubbard to establish a foundation that began to train people in his auditing techniques. In 1954, the first Church of Scientology opened in Los Angeles, with other churches opening soon after. Hubbard died in 1986. The church is now led by David Miscavige. Why is the church so controversial? Many groups and individuals have challenged Scientology’s legitimacy as a religion. Scientologists have faced opposition from the medical community over the religion’s claims about mental health, from the scientific community over its claims about its   and from other religious groups about its status as a religion. ”It’s part therapy, part religion, part UFO group,” says Bromley. ”It’s a mix of things that’s unlike any other religious group out there.” For a long time, the Internal Revenue Service denied the Scientologists’ attempts to be declared a church with   status. But the IRS granted them that status in 1993. Many members say the church is largely about  .  ”What I believe in my own life is that it’s a search for how I can do things better, whether it’s being a better man or a better father or finding ways for myself to improve,” Tom Cruise told Playboy magazine. ”Individuals have to decide what is true and real for them.” What does Scientology teach about psychiatry? L. Ron Hubbard rejected psychiatry and psychiatric drugs because he said they interfered with the functioning of the rational mind. Scientologists continue to promote that idea. The Church of Scientology’s website says that ”the effects of medical and psychiatric drugs, whether painkillers, tranquilizers or ’antidepressants,’ are as disastrous” as illicit drugs. How many Scientologists are there? That’s a matter of considerable dispute. The Church of Scientology says it has 10, 000 churches, missions and groups operating in 167 countries, with 4. 4 million more people signing up every year. Scholars say that, despite the global proliferation of church buildings, the membership numbers are much lower than the church claims, likely in the hundreds of thousands. Several of the church’s followers are Hollywood celebrities."
Trump to deliver Liberty University commencement address,CNN,Dan Merica,2017-03-22,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump will deliver the May commencement address at Liberty University, the largest Christian university in the world announced Wednesday. Trump, who spoke at the school days before the Iowa caucuses in January 2016, will become the first sitting US president since George H. W. Bush to speak at a Liberty University commencement. ”I look forward to speaking to this amazing group of students on such a momentous occasion,” Trump told the Christian Broadcasting Network. Trump added that he looked forward to ”celebrating the success of this graduating class as well as sharing lessons as they embark on their next chapter full of hope, faith, optimism and a passion for life.” The trip to Liberty University will reunite Trump with one of his most vocal evangelical conservative surrogates, Liberty University President Jerry Falwell.  ”It is a tremendous honor and privilege for any university to host a sitting US President, and we are incredibly grateful to have President Trump be a part of this historic day,” Falwell said. ”This May, Liberty students will have the honor of hearing from a man who has succeeded in business and in politics, defying conventional wisdom to become the 45th President of the United States.” Trump, a Presbyterian, made Liberty University last year the venue for his most concerted pitch to evangelical Christian voters, some of whom had disavowed his campaign and backed Texas Sen. Ted Cruz in the 2016 GOP primary. ”Christianity, it’s under siege,” Trump had said. ”We’re going to protect Christianity. I don’t have to be politically correct.” Trump’s lack of biblical lingo drew snickers from the crowd, too.  ”Two Corinthians, 3:17, that’s the whole ballgame,” Trump had said, describing a biblical verse. The correct terminology is ”Second Corinthians.” Falwell, the son of famed televangelist Jerry Falwell, endorsed Trump shortly after the speech at Liberty University, touting the Republican candidate as a ”successful executive and entrepreneur, a wonderful father and a man who I believe can lead our country to greatness again.” Falwell held tight to Trump, even after video emerged of Trump describing his own sexual aggressive behavior toward women. ”We’re all sinners, every one of us. We’ve all done things we wish we hadn’t,” Falwell told WABC Radio in New York City, arguing that the release of the video was a ”planned . .. conspiracy among the establishment Republicans who’ve known about it for weeks and who tried to time it to do the maximum damage to Donald Trump.” Falwell’s loyalty was rewarded, too. Len Stevens, the Liberty University spokesman, told CNN in February that Falwell would lead an education task force put together by Trump, where the evangelical leader would push to stop regulations coming out of the Education Department, especially those that apply to colleges and universities. Liberty University regularly hosts political speakers. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush spoke ahead of the 2016 campaign. Sen. John McCain spoke in 2006 and Ronald Reagan addressed the school in 1980. And amid the 2012 presidential election, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney spoke at the school’s commencement. Romney’s invite caused a stir at the university because some evangelical Christians consider Mormonism, Romney’s faith, to be a cult."
Health care bill at House Rules Committee: What to expect,CNN,MJ Lee,2017-03-22,"Washington (CNN) The Republican health care bill currently being considered at the House Rules Committee. It’s all part of a winding legislative process ahead of Thursday’s full House vote on the bill.  The Rules panel, controlled by allies of House Speaker Paul Ryan, isn’t expected to change the bill. It’s in charge of approving the amendments that will be voted on by the House Thursday. Here’s what to expect: A ”very long” hearing. This isn’t anticipated to go into the early morning hours or 27 hours like previous committee markups did earlier this month, but members    and reporters    should expect a full day. Will Democrats offer amendments? For now, little or none. Why? ”This bill is so badly flawed that there’s no fixing it” is how a Democratic committee aide described it.  But Democrats will speak their minds. Lawmakers will give testimony basically on how bad they believe the GOP bill is, and take as much as as they can. It’s part of their overall strategy Wednesday to highlight what they say are the flaws in the plan to repeal and replace most of Obamacare. Former Vice President Joe Biden is also on Capitol Hill Wednesday, for instance. Everything depends on Pete Sessions. Republican committee Chairman Sessions plans to be plans to be very generous with time, an aide said. Republicans want to prove this is an ”open process.” An aide joked they might even physically open the windows in the committee room.   So will these be the only amendments? Depends on what type of rule the committee approves at the end. A ”Closed rule” means nobody can offer additional amendments on the floor, and if that’s the case, expect Democrats to throw a fit. An ”Open rule” would allow for amendments and anything is possible."
Anti-ISIS partners want US to clarify strategy,CNN,Nicole Gaouette,2017-03-22,"Washington (CNN) Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Wednesday that defeating ISIS would be the United States’ top priority in the Middle East and hinted at establishing a safe zone for refugee protection, as allies chafed at the time it’s taking the Trump administration to articulate a strategy. The US will continue to pursue the Obama administration’s   approach of using military force identifying and intercepting terrorist fighters who go to Syria from other countries targeting the terror group’s finances working to counter its propaganda and stabilizing areas once ISIS has been ousted. Tillerson, speaking as he opened the 10th Global Coalition Ministerial meeting on ISIS, added that ”the United States will increase our pressure on ISIS and   and will work to establish interim zones of stability, through ceasefires, to allow refugees to return home.” He offered no details, but said the US is ”working to tailor a similar approach specific to the challenges in Syria” and that it would be ”a more refined approach” that it ”is still coming together.” The Obama administration had hesitated to establish ”safe zones” because of the military commitment required to defend such areas from Syrian government forces and the possibility of a clash with Russian forces, present in the country to help bolster its ally, the Syrian regime. ”I recognize there are many pressing challenges in the Middle East, but defeating ISIS is the United States’ No. 1 goal in the region,” Tillerson said. ”When everything is a priority, nothing is a priority. We must continue to keep our focus on the most urgent matter at hand.” Diplomats said they’re eager for the administration to clarify its strategy. ”I was hoping for more specifics,” French Foreign Minister   Ayrault told reporters. ”We’ve been asking for specific answers for a couple of weeks from the new administration.” ”I acknowledge it takes time for the American administration to consider the decisions,” the French minister said. ”But we have our own ideas and we need to move forward.” Ayrault said that top Trump officials told him they needed ”a bit more time to consider their options” and that they would present them to the President in the next few weeks.  A senior Arab diplomat said the day’s meeting was being seen as more of ”a briefing” than an unveiling of any plan    and that there clearly isn’t one in place yet.  ”The administration is saying the right things, but the broader strokes have not morphed into a strategy yet,” the diplomat said. ”Right now it’s about   tactical moves. Any strategy has to take into account how you confront all of the extremists in the region and how to confront Iran.” The Arab envoy said expectations for the Trump administration weren’t high.  ”We don’t expect a brand new or fundamentally different strategy,” the diplomat said, adding that one change foreign partners do anticipate is a faster   process.  ”There won’t be as much debate about every decision,” the diplomat said of the new administration. ”(Defense Secretary James) Mattis and the generals will tell Trump what they think they need to do and Trump will approve it. Everything will be expedited.”  But Ayrault hasn’t seen the process speed up. ”There are is some American hesitation as to which forces should be used,” he said, referring to the militias on the ground, which are allied with different interests and ethnic groups. He said the US also needs to firm up its approach to taking back Raqaa, the ISIS stronghold in Syria.  He also called for more American direction on peace talks being organized by the UN in Geneva, and he said it wasn’t clear to him what Tillerson meant by ”interim zones of stability.” The   coalition focused the   meeting, hosted at the State Department, on the ground campaign in Iraq and Syria, as the US backs local Iraqi forces fighting to retake the ISIS stronghold of Mosul and is expanding its effort as it pressed toward the terror group’s capital of Raqqa, in Syria. The group also concentrated on raising funds to support humanitarian efforts to stabilize areas liberated from ISIS. Despite Trump administration proposals to slash the State Department budget    and particularly its aid and development programs    funding to help stabilize areas affected by ISIS should not be affected, State Department spokesman Mark Toner has said, as it has already been allocated in previous budgets. RELATED: Tillerson plan to skip NATO, visit Russia puts allies on edge, Wednesday’s event marked the first full meeting of the coalition since 2014 and the first of the Trump administration. President Donald Trump campaigned on a promise to take a tougher stance against ISIS. As a candidate, Trump announced he had a secret plan to defeat ISIS, even as he was suggesting that the US needed to pull back from acting as a world policeman and enforcer of stability. Instead of unveiling that secret plan after he was elected, Trump signed an executive order on January 28 directing his national security team to come up with a strategy to defeat the group. On Wednesday, Tillerson made clear the administration’s plan will rely heavily on military means. ”The expansion of ISIS has necessitated a   military response, and our offensive measures are reclaiming areas in Iraq and Syria in which ISIS has had a large and destructive footprint. Our end goal in this phase is the regional elimination of ISIS through military force.” Tillerson also gave a nod to restabilizing areas once ISIS is defeated. He referred to efforts to clear rubble and land mines, restore water services and electricity. ”A successful stabilization phase will set the stage for a successful normalization phase,” the US diplomat said.    ”We will continue to facilitate the return of people to their homes, and work with local political leadership,” he told the gathering. ”They will provide stable and fair governance, rebuild infrastructure, and provide essential services. We will use our diplomatic presence on the ground to facilitate channels of dialogue between local leadership and coalition partners.” But he also said that ”we are not in the business of   or reconstruction.” Once areas are stabilized, he continued, ”local leaders and local governments will take on the process of restoring their communities in the wake of ISIS with our support.” Tillerson called on the gathered nations to do more to contribute to the fight, both on the military and humanitarian front. He noted that the US provides 75% of the military resources in Syria and covers 25% of humanitarian aid. ”The United States will do its part,” Tillerson said, ”but the circumstances on the ground require more, from my point of view,” of other coalition members. Many former generals, including some who fought in Iraq, have warned that the US ability to do that work could be endangered by the budget cuts Tillerson is charged with implementing at the State Department. ”If we’ve learned anything since September 11 from the military side, it’s that the challenges we face today don’t necessarily lend themselves to pure military solutions,” retired   General George Casey, the former commanding general in Iraq from 2004 to 2007, told CNN this week."
US joins first air assault ’behind enemy lines’ against ISIS in Syria,CNN,Barbara Starr,2017-03-22,"Washington (CNN) Fighters in Syria have begun a major ground offensive, backed up by US forces, to retake a vital dam near Raqqa, Syria, from ISIS, a US official told CNN Wednesday. The attack also included an unprecedented air assault involving US helicopters landing behind enemy lines    flying about 500 local US allies and coalition military advisers across the Euphrates River and Lake Assad so they could attack the   dam and neighboring town and airfield from the south. ”This is the first time we have conducted an air movement, air assault, with the Syrian Arab Coalition and Syrian Democratic Forces,” Col. Joseph Scrocca, a coalition public affairs officer, said. On a call with reporters from Baghdad Wednesday, Scrocca called the air operation a ”daring assault behind enemy lines.” Scrocca would not say how many troops were involved, but a military source said about 500 troops were airlifted behind enemy lines. The attack was backed by US Marines firing M777 howitzers and close air support, including airstrikes carried out by Apache helicopters. But ISIS remains in control of the area after the attack, and weeks of tough fighting could remain, Scrocca said. ”We believe there are foreign fighters there, probably in the hundreds,” he said. ”The (Syrian Democratic Forces) and our partners there are facing a pretty heavy fight    that’s what makes this type of operation so daring. I think we were lucky we caught ISIS by surprise. They are still reacting to this maneuver.” Tabqa Dam is located 25 miles west of Raqqa, ISIS’   capital, and supplies electric power to a wide area of Syria, according to the US. The area has been under ISIS control since 2013. Retaking the dam is considered a vital step toward further isolating the area around Raqqa and eventually recapturing the city. The dam and surrounding terrain is a key military asset because it’s ”critical for the isolation of Raqqa and the next step toward an annihilation of ISIS in Syria,” but the dam’s destruction ”could lead to a severe humanitarian crisis,” Scrocca warned. US Marines equipped with artillery arrived in northern Syria earlier this month with the goal of accelerating the capabilities of the   Arab and Kurdish forces there. The Pentagon and Marine Corps declined to confirm the deployment because of security concerns in the region. They also declined to specify the exact location of the forces or how many are there. A similar deployment last year near Mosul, Iraq, involved several hundred Marines equipped with artillery guns to provide covering fire for advancing forces. The US believes the pressure on ISIS in Raqqa is working. A US official told reporters on March 8 that intelligence indicates some ISIS leaders and operatives continue to try to leave the city.  There is also US intelligence that indicates the city is laced with trenches, tunnels, roadside bombs and houses and buildings wired to explode, the official said. If correct, it indicates that the US has likely been able to gather intelligence from both overhead surveillance aircraft and people on the ground. However, the official also noted that ”Raqqa will probably not be the final battle against ISIS,” and added that the group still has some personnel dispersed in areas south and east of the city. ISIS could have as many as 4, 000 fighters in Raqqa, according to very rough US estimates, the official said. Since November, the terror group has lost some 3, 400 square kilometers around Raqqa, in a wide arc north of the city. "
"4-year-old boy, thrift-store shopping with his grandma, accidentally hangs himself in a dressing room",CNN,Doug Criss,2017-03-21," (CNN) It’s an unspeakable tragedy that happened in the most mundane of places    a thrift store dressing room. Over the weekend    Ryu Pena was at Again Thrift and More in Mankato, Minnesota, when he accidentally hanged himself in the store’s dressing room. Police say Ryu slipped away from his grandmother, who was shopping at the store, and went into an empty changing room. He apparently closed the door, climbed on a bench and got the hoodie he was wearing caught on a coat hook. ”We believe that he got himself caught up on a coat hook within that dressing room area and couldn’t free himself from it,” Commander Jeremy Clifton with Mankato Public Safety told CNN affiliate WCCO. Ryu’s little feet couldn’t reach the floor, so he hung there and suffocated, all while his grandmother and others frantically looked for him. By the time he was found, it was too late. Ryu’s mom, Denise Gonzalez, said her son lost his life simply playing. ”That’s the only way I can describe it. He was playing because he’s very curious, adventurous, and it all just happened so quickly,” she told WCCO. Gonzalez said she’ll remember her son as being really active, as a little boy who loved to jump on couches and do flips. ”He was such a daredevil.” His family has set up a GoFundMe page to help raise money for his funeral."
Houses of Parliament (Great Britain) Fast Facts,CNN,,2013-10-31," (CNN) Here’s some background information about Great Britain’s Houses of Parliament, located on the Thames River in London.  Facts:The meeting place of Great Britain’s bicameral legislature   composed of the House of Commons and the House of Lords   is also known as Westminster Palace. Visitors are subject to airport style security checks. Security technology, such as CCTV cameras and alarms, are used throughout the estate. In addition to unarmed security officers, armed police officers are also on the premises. Timeline:11th century   The original palace is built. 1604     A group of English Catholics, including Guy Fawkes, plots to blow up Parliament to protest their treatment by the Protestants. However, the plot is uncovered and the conspirators hanged. November 5 is still celebrated in England as ”Guy Fawkes Day” when people celebrate with bonfires and fireworks and burn effigies of Fawkes. October 16, 1834   A fire destroys most of the building.   1840   Construction begins on the current Houses of Parliament. 1852   House of Commons first used. 1870   Construction completed.   May 11, 1941   House of Commons chamber destroyed in bombings during WWII. It is rebuilt by architect Sir Giles Gilbert Scott. 1950   The reconstruction of House of Commons is complete. 1987   The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) designates the building as a World Heritage site.   2000   Portcullis House, a new Parliamentary building, is completed.  February 2001   Portcullis House officially opens. June 18, 2015   An independent committee issues a report outlining the need for extensive repairs throughout the historic complex. Issues that need attention include wiring problems, loose asbestos and rats. The principal architect at the Houses of Parliament tells the BBC, ”Some of the facades are actually sinking and we’re going to have to investigate that very soon.”  March 22, 2017   Khalid Masood plows a car through crowds on Westminster Bridge in central London before attempting to storm the Houses of Parliament in what police believe was an act of   terrorism.

Trump’s White House is starting to look a lot like Putin’s Kremlin,CNN,,2017-03-22," (CNN) Critical media voices denounced as ”enemies of the people.”  Power not in the hands of elected officials, but the President’s close friends and family. Statecraft taking second place to the interests of the inner circle.  While there’s no real evidence that Donald Trump is Vladimir Putin’s puppet, his White House is certainly starting to resemble the Kremlin in the way it works. First, there’s its belief that it can define truth to its own convenience and shout down different perspectives as ”fake news” and label those who question the official line as ”enemies of the people.”  Of course the Kremlin, with its stranglehold on Russian TV, can be even more inventive.    Dmitry Kiselev, for example, regularly conjures tales of bizarre conspiracies, and damns Putin’s enemies as traitors and fascists.  The White House is making a spirited challenge for Kiselev’s crown: from tales that Trump drew ”the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration” right through to the recent claims of Trump Tower wiretapping.  That a free press exercising its freedom in ways inconvenient to the administration is seen as a sign of dishonesty and disloyalty is truly chilling. But the ”fourth estate” is just one of the institutions under threat in Trump’s America.  Over his 17 years dominating Russia (including one term as prime ministerial  ) Putin has essentially hollowed out Russia’s institutions.  Unless they have some personal relationship with the boss, ministers are just junior managers, and policy is not decided    or even discussed    in Cabinet, let alone Parliament. Instead, it emerges from shadowy circles of Putin’s closest allies and cronies, often without records, warning or explanation. The United States is not quite in the same situation    yet    but it is clear that the most important policy decisions are likewise being made out of sight.  After all, both in Moscow and Washington, the key to true power has more to do with your relationship to the president, not your job title.  In Russia, the prime minister    constitutionally the second most powerful figure in the government    has long been eclipsed by the head of Putin’s Presidential Administration. Trump has a similarly personalized and informal approach. His daughter Ivanka is now to have an office in the White House and access to classified intelligence. His    Jared Kushner is playing a pivotal role in foreign policy. Although he was forced to roll back partially, Trump’s first instinct was to take the director of national intelligence and chairman of the joint chiefs off the permanent membership of the National Security Council and install Bannon in their stead.  What matters is how many degrees of separation you have from the boss, not what you know or what your job title may be.  Many of Trump’s inner circle are businesspeople, so maybe it is unsurprising that they might see their roles in terms of how they further their economic interests.  Putin treats the whole Russian state as his piggy bank, but also is comfortable helping his closest allies do very well out of official policy. People like his old judo buddies the Rotenbergs get awarded lucrative government contracts, are bailed out for their failures, and even compensated for sanctions losses.  Meanwhile, apart from Trump’s sidestepping demands that he divest himself of his own portfolio, his friends look set to benefit. Indeed, already he has said that he wants to cut back controls on Wall Street because of ”friends of mine, who have nice businesses who can’t borrow money.” There is, it seems, no longer anything unique about the Kremlin’s personalized,   style of rule."
Samoura: ’Facelift’ of FIFA’s male hierarchy is ’ongoing’,CNN, Amanda Davies ,2017-03-22," (CNN) As FIFA’s secretary general, Fatma Samba Diouf Samoura is one of the most powerful figures in world football.  Her appointment last June was historic and groundbreaking    the    from Senegal is the first woman, and the first   to hold an executive post at soccer’s governing body.  Nearly a year into her role, Samoura talks exclusively to CNN Sport about major issues plaguing the game, from inequality and racism to hooliganism and corruption.  ’FIFA facelift ongoing’ Since May 2015, when the US Department of Justice indicted several top executives, FIFA has been engulfed in claims of widespread corruption.  Two of the most powerful men in the sport    then FIFA president Sepp Blatter and former UEFA president Michel Platini    are serving lengthy bans from all   activities, while a Swiss criminal investigation is ongoing.  READ: Why the US is bringing down the hammer on FIFA, READ: Corruption probe targets ’World Cup of fraud’ While Gianni Infantino promised to restore the organization’s reputation upon his appointment as FIFA’s new president, Samoura is intent on ensuring there is equal representation of men and women at all levels of its hierarchy.  ”We are regenerating the organization in many ways,” Samoura told CNN. ”The facelift is still ongoing and we would like to see more women in senior positions.  ”When you look at FIFA at the low executive level, there are more women than men. In fact, 61% of women and less than 40% men. ”But as we are getting higher to the football governing body hierarchy today we are only 42% of women and definitely the target is to have, by the end of the first mandate term of the president, 50% representation at all levels    including at all levels in the confederation level.” Women at the center of football, While it took FIFA 100 years to appoint its first female executive, Samoura has set her sights on putting women at the center of the sport. Making women’s football   and less dependent on the men’s game by focusing on sponsorship and television rights is a must, she says.  ”We need to talk seriously to media broadcasters but also to our commercial partners so that they give additional consideration and definitely more revenue to women’s competitions,” the former United Nations director and representative said.   ”We are, let’s say, heavily dependent on the men’s World Cup in order to fund all of our other competitions.  ”The overarching goal that I’d like to push whilst I’m still in FIFA is to make sure that the women’s competitions generate their own resources, especially that the women’s World Cup will generate enough resources to support the youth and grassroots and women’s competitions in general.” READ: Is Russia ready to host $10B tournament? READ: FIFA president fails to regain public trust, Zero tolerance to hooliganism, The spotlight has been put on Russian hooliganism since the country’s football fans were blamed for the violence which erupted in the French city of Marseille during Euro 2016.  With Russia hosting this year’s Confederations Cup    a FIFA tournament that acts as a   dress rehearsal to its staging of the 2018 World Cup    many fear a repeat of those brutal scenes which injured and hospitalized many. Samoura said the governing body had ”learned a great deal” from those street clashes in France, which centered around the   match between Russia and England. ”We’ve been working very closely with security authorities throughout the country in order to really make sure that people coming from abroad but also fans, especially when it comes to the Confederations Cup, don’t really suffer from any ill treatment,” she said.  ”Definitely we at FIFA make sure that there is a zero tolerance policy for all competitions that we are organizing and Russia will also be very seriously scrutinized when it comes to   and   behavior.” ’Education key to tackling racism’ In recent years, a number of black footballers playing in Russia’s top flight have complained of repeated and persistent racism, while human rights activists highlighted the government’s   propanda legislation ahead of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi.  How accepting will Russia be of those who visit the country during the June   2 Confederations Cup and the World Cup? Samoura    who is responsible for running FIFA’s finances, the organization of the World Cup, and other competitions    said education was key.  ”Sanctions are not always efficient. I believe in education,” said Samoura, who admitted to experiencing racist abuse while attending a football match with her husband when at the UN.  ”Changing the perception of people, changing the mentality, changing the way that culturally people learn takes time and people should recognize that and give people enough time to do that. ”There are several ways to do it. The first one is definitely to tell the people that we are living in a global world and these things should not happen, so education.  ”The second thing is definitely to impose sanctions and the third thing is to give even stronger sanctions and get them out of business.  ”What I know is that when teams in Europe started being fined and being imposed huge financial penalties, they are taking it more seriously.  ”But for me, this is the last resort. Educating people is for me the key element to really get people evolving and changing their behavior.” Politics and sport, FIFA is clamping down on government interference in football. As a result, Russia’s World Cup head Vitaly Mutko has been barred from seeking   to the FIFA Council after failing an eligibility check, with the organization saying he could no longer hold the role because of his position as the country’s deputy prime minister.  Mutko, also president of Russia’s football federation, has been directly implicated in the McLaren report, which alleged a   doping program. Russia has been suspended by athletics’ governing body the IAAF for   doping, which covers August’s 2017 World Championships in London. However, Samoura insisted doping would not be a problem at the World Cup next year and said Mutko had helped open doors to put football high on the agenda of Russia’s government.  ”We take very seriously doping issues for all of our competitions and since the overall doping program is run by FIFA using laboratories that are accredited by the World   Agency (WADA) we have no reason to doubt or to think that there will be wrongdoing during our tournaments,” she said.

"AQAP trying to hide explosives in laptops, official says",CNN,Barbara Starr,2017-03-21,"Washington (CNN) Intelligence obtained in recent weeks found that an al Qaeda affiliate was perfecting techniques for hiding explosives in batteries and battery compartments of electronic devices, according to a US official. The discovery that al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula was looking to exploit batteries and their compartments in laptops and other commercial electronic devices led the United States and United Kingdom to ban devices larger than a cellphone from certain flights, the US official told CNN. A US official told CNN that intelligence shows growing capability from ISIS, al Qaeda in Syria and al Shabaab as well AQAP. It is not fully clear to what extent these groups are sharing specific information, but ”there is a growing pool of intelligence all pointing to threats to aviation” the official said.  However, the officials said that ISIS is believed not to be as advanced in perfecting techniques for hiding explosives in electronics as AQAP. RELATED: What security experts are saying, The new security restrictions, announced Tuesday, require airlines based in the Middle East and North Africa to prevent people flying from eight countries from bringing any device bigger than a smartphone aboard their aircraft. Instead, those electronics need to be stored in the cargo hold. The bans involve some of the   aviation security measures taken since the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. Top carriers affected  The US ban will affect more than 50 flights a day from 10 airports in the mainly Muslim countries, including major hubs such as Dubai and Istanbul, according to senior administration officials. The nine airlines affected were notified of the procedures by the United States at 3 a. m. ET Tuesday and must comply within 96 hours. The UK ban affects six countries, including two not on the US list: Tunisia and Lebanon. Top international carriers    such as Emirates Airline, Qatar Airways, British Airways and Turkish Airlines    are among those that will have to implement new restrictions. US officials told CNN on Tuesday that intelligence ”indicates terrorist groups continue to target commercial aviation” by ”smuggling explosive devices in various consumer items.” In February 2016, a bomb hidden inside a laptop detonated aboard a Daallo Airlines flight out of Mogadishu, Somalia. The bomber was killed and a hole was blown in the side of the fuselage. The aircraft landed safely. Not just a Trump decision, An aviation official informed CNN that he was told firsthand by an intelligence official that this electronics ban was not a ”political move.” In fact, career employees are heavily involved in this decision, and this wasn’t just a Trump administration decision, the aviation official said. Under the new restrictions, the electronic devices    many of which have lithium ion batteries    will now be carried in the cargo deck of the airplane, underneath the passenger cabin. Aviation safety experts and regulatory agencies have long warned that batteries shipped in bulk could cause a fire and spark a chain reaction that could bring down an aircraft. The International Civil Aviation Organization advised global regulators last year to ban bulk shipments of such batteries in the cargo holds of passenger jets. Some airlines are still seeking clarity on the reasoning behind aspects of the ban, according to the official. For example: If there is an immediate threat to aviation security, why is DHS giving airlines 96 hours to comply with the ban instead of implementing it immediately? But Rep. John Katko,   York, who has been briefed on the matter, said, ”There’s no question this is the right move.” Katko said the ban is based on credible new and existing intelligence. The congressman said  the list of airports that fell under the ban were based on the intelligence community’s assessment of the information. The 10 international airports covered by the US ban are in Cairo, Egypt Dubai and Abu Dhabi, UAE Istanbul, Turkey Doha, Qatar Amman, Jordan Kuwait City Casablanca, Morocco and Jeddah and Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The nine airlines are Egyptair, Emirates Airline, Etihad Airways, Kuwait Airways, Qatar Airways, Royal Air Maroc, Royal Jordanian Airlines, Saudi Arabian Airlines and Turkish Airlines. As of Tuesday, Emirates, Etihad and Royal Air Maroc had announced the implementation of new rules limiting what electronic devices can be carried on flights to the United States and said it would start on Saturday."

Police: Woman found dangling from shoelaces after botched WH breach,CNN,Noah Gray,2017-03-22," (CNN) A woman was arrested late Tuesday night after she allegedly attempted to gain entry to the White House, telling police she was there to speak to President Donald Trump. Secret Service officers observed the woman, identified as Marci Wahl, 38, walking and staring at the White House complex before discovering she had jumped a fence on the south side but had gotten stuck.  Officers found Wahl, of Everett, Washington, hanging from the inside of the fence by her shoelaces which were ”caught on top of the fence,” according to a police report obtained by CNN. ”The individual became entangled in security features affixed to the top of the fence, suspending them in the air on the inside of the fence,” the Secret Service told CNN.  Security at the White House was briefly elevated with Secret Service agents and officers elevating the posture of their readiness, they say.  Wahl, who did not have any weapons on her, was arrested and transported to a nearby police station after refusing medical treatment. Secret Service and Washington Metropolitan Police officers discovered a map of the White House when the arrested Wahl, who did not have a criminal history. She was charged with unlawful entry and pleaded not guilty in DC superior court Wednesday, records show. She was released and given a stay away order and has an initial status hearing set for April 27. A message left with her attorney was not returned. The arrest is the latest security incident to take place near the White House in recent days. On Saturday, a man jumped over a bicycle rack in front of the presidential mansion, briefly putting the complex into an escalated security posture, two law enforcement officials told CNN. And on March 10, an intruder carrying a backpack with mace and a letter for the President jumped the White House fence and was able to stay on the grounds for more than 15 minutes. Trump was inside the residence at the time."
GOP fails to reach health care deal,CNN,MJ Lee,2017-03-22,"Washington (CNN) A frenzied 24 hours filled with hushed deliberations on Capitol Hill,   meetings at the White House and    phone calls with the President came to an end Wednesday    quietly and unceremoniously.  Well before midnight, this much was clear: Republicans still had no deal on their health care bill to repeal Obamacare, as a Thursday vote loomed around the corner.  House Speaker Paul Ryan and his top deputies huddled with a group of moderate Republicans in the Speaker’s office Wednesday night, as members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus sounded increasingly optimistic that they were close to getting a major concession from the White House.  Hours later, Ryan and his top deputies never came out to speak to the cameras and dozens of reporters waiting outside, and it was clear that leadership had no good news to share. With the exception of a few members who rushed away without speaking to press, all leaders in the room, including Ryan, appeared to have ducked out using side exits. While this gathering was wrapping up, House leaders had gotten more bad news: GOP Rep. Charlie Dent, the leader of the moderate Tuesday Group, released a statement opposing the current bill spearheaded by Ryan and President Trump.  The   session in Ryan’s office came soon after what appeared to be a major breakthrough in the impasse. The Freedom Caucus, which had stubbornly opposed the GOP bill for days, was suddenly optimistic that a deal was possible. The White House was offering a provision that would strip the   ”essential health benefits” from the House bill, and GOP leadership indicated they were open to this change.  Late Wednesday, Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows said: ”We are very hopeful we can get this done.” Now, Trump and his GOP colleagues on Capitol Hill head into Thursday still unclear of the fate of their mission to repeal Obamacare.  ”It has always been the case   pull the bill one way, risk losing members on the other end,” a lawmaker involved told CNN. The vote count has been tight. According to CNN’s ongoing whip count, as of Wednesday night, 24 House Republicans have   said they will vote against the bill, while four more have indicated they are likely to oppose it. With so much on the line, Trump, White House officials and Republican leaders have been lobbying their colleagues all week. On Wednesday, Trump even personally called individual members of the Freedom Caucus just as a possible deal was emerging. Trump is not involved in the details    ”Either doesn’t know, doesn’t care or both,” an aide told CNN    but he is very involved in the sale now, and ”appears energized by that.” Getting conservatives to back the bill will be essential because moderates are jumping ship. Even before Dent’s announcement, a handful of relatively moderate Republicans hailing from New York, Iowa and New Jersey said Wednesday they would not support the bill. One lawmaker even stated bluntly that the GOP plan simply was not better than Obamacare. GOP Rep. Frank LoBiondo of New Jersey said he was concerned about the bill’s impact on his state’s residents and that the proposal ”is not as good as or better than what we currently have.” The prospects of cutting out the requirement that insurance plans cover essential health benefits would further lead to moderates turning away from the GOP proposal. Trump and Ryan must get 216 Republicans on board and can afford only 21 defections, if no Democrat joins them. ”There’s a certain amount of gamesmanship going on here    a little bit of chicken,” GOP Rep. Tom Cole told CNN on Wednesday.  As deliberations continue, 2018 is on every Republican’s mind.  Trump warned of big losses at the ballot box if Republicans fail to repeal and replace Obamacare, and the White House insists there is no alternative legislation or plan if they fail. ”There is no Plan B. There’s Plan A and Plan A,” said White House press secretary Sean Spicer. ”We’re going to get this done.” Various lawmakers who are planning to vote ”no” have described to CNN having    minute phone calls with Trump officials in recent days. And Vice President Mike Pence and Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price are also involved in    lobbying. Ryan’s whip operation has also been in full blitz mode.  The House speaker has been texting directly with some members. Majority Whip Steve Scalise and Deputy Whip Patrick McHenry have also been singling out individual Freedom Caucus members to try to peel them away from the group. Major changes to ’essential health benefits’ Some of Trump’s personal lobbying has gotten results.  According to Republican Rep. Richard Hudson, who supports the bill, Trump agreed on Wednesday to GOP Rep. Steve King’s request to lobby to change the essential health benefits provision at a later point. At a meeting at the White House, Trump told King he would publicly push for the change in the Senate and King agreed to vote for the bill.  ”They shook hands,” Hudson told reporters. ”We are voting tomorrow, no matter what, but I feel like we’ll have the votes.” Separately, GOP Rep. Lou Barletta announced Wednesday that he had switched his ”no” vote to ”yes” after receiving support for his legislation to deny health care credits to illegal immigrants. Meanwhile, the White House has been busy courting the Freedom Caucus for days. According to a source, the caucus’ members have been invited to visit in small groups in recent days. That effort continued Wednesday, with the group’s members again paying a visit to 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. What’s in the bill, The bill introduced earlier this month would roll back many of the Obamacare taxes and eradicate the individual mandate. Instead of the subsidies available in the Affordable Care Act, the GOP plan provides Americans with refundable tax credits to purchase health insurance. The bill also significantly restructures Medicaid and allows states to require able bodied adults to work if they want to be eligible for the program. After 2020, states will no longer be able to expand Medicaid like they could under Obamacare and states that haven’t expanded the program at all are barred from doing so. The GOP bill, however, still includes some of the most popular pieces of Obamacare, including protections for people with   conditions (though insurers would be allowed to charge higher premiums to individuals whose coverage has lapsed) and letting children stay on their parents’ insurance plans until the age of 26. The   Congressional Budget Office estimated that 24 million fewer Americans would be covered under this bill than under Obamacare by 2026 if the bill is enacted in its current form. What’s inside the Republican health care bill?"
China through the eyes of Andy Warhol,CNN,Jamie Fullerton,2017-03-23," (CNN) Andy Warhol’s personal photographs from his trip to Beijing and Hong Kong in 1982 are arguably the most famous holiday snaps of all time.  And depending on how a May auction of the collection fares, they could soon be among the most valuable. Warhol, who was one of the most famous people in the western world at the time of his visit, went largely unrecognized on the streets of Beijing. It makes the images even more remarkable, not least to collectors, who have come to view the set as a rare slice of history in the making.  The   trip saw the late pop art icon take his camera to sites including the Great Wall and Tiananmen Square, where he came    with the portrait of Mao Zedong that had inspired his own colorful 1970s paintings and prints of the former leader. Over 200 personal photos from Warhol’s China set will go under the hammer at a Phillips auction at the Mandarin Oriental in Hong Kong. The candid shots are currently on display at the hotel, to coincide with the opening of Art Basel Hong Kong. Phillips’ associate director Charlotte Raybaud tells CNN the auction house is hoping to sell the set for over $1. 1 million (HK$8. 5 million). ”The photos capture his personality in a way that may even be more genuine and pure than the pictures he takes prior to this, because he came to Beijing and Hong Kong as a tourist,” she says. High art? But should the photos, a separate set to the more conventional images taken on the trip by Warhol’s traveling companion, photographer Christopher Makos, be considered  ? To some, like curator Jeffrey Deitch    who also accompanied Warhol for the Hong Kong leg of the trip    they represent great examples of the New Yorker’s artistic vision. ”Andy was not making art in a precious way,” he said. ”It was so inside him    this unique vision of the world. They’re very strong images, not just random snapshots.” Read: Nudity, taboos and Kate: Are these the world’s most wanted photos? To others, like Makos, the merit attributed to the photos by the Phillips auction is ”ridiculous” and ”nonsense.” ”(They were) snapshots. Andy was never thinking about the light and dark, he was hoping he had the settings right and that’s it,” says the photographer. Warhol the tourist, Warhol traveled to Hong Kong at the invitation of Alfred Siu, a young local entrepreneur, who had commissioned Warhol to paint portraits of Princess Diana and Prince Charles for a new nightclub he was opening on the island.  Upon arrival, Siu surprised the artist by announcing he had arranged for him to visit Beijing    a city which was then still largely   to foreigners. Read: Is this the world’s most photogenic potato? Photo sells for $1. 08m, And while Deitch and Makos continue to argue about the artistic value of Warhol’s photography, they agree that the trip across the border into the mainland was particularly special. ”Andy and I loved looking out and seeing a sea of blue or green outfits,” says Makos of his time in the Chinese capital. ”We thought it was chic, like Pierre Cardin or something. Women were starting to experiment with western clothing, and because they weren’t familiar with it they were such bad dressers, they didn’t know how to put things together.”  Locals in turn, were also curious about Warhol.  ”People were fascinated by his look,” recalls Makos ”Like, ’Who is this? ’” The artist’s status as a regular tourist rather than a global celebrity is evidenced throughout the exhibition.  In one image, he is seen standing with a bellboy, likely in Beijing’s Peking Hotel in which he stayed. In others, he captures everyday holiday items such as buffet food and a beer bottle on a restaurant table. ”Andy was about the everyday, the mundane, creating, in an accumulated way, something of tremendous interest,” Deitch tells CNN. Photographs from the ”Warhol in China” collection are on display at the Mandarin Oriental Hong Kong from 20 March until 2 April. The photographs will be auctioned by Phillips on 28 May. "
South Korea: Sewol ferry emerges from the water 3 years after sinking,CNN,James Griffiths,2017-03-23," (CNN) Three years after they watched in horror as a passenger ferry carrying their children sank off the coast of South Korea, parents of the victims watched the vessel return to the surface Thursday.  ”I feel so sorry for my child, thinking how he suffered, I wasn’t there to offer him anything,”  Lim   who lost his son in the Sewol ferry disaster, told CNN.   The Sewol sank on April 16, 2014, killing 304 people    mostly teens on a school trip. Nine bodies are still missing it is hoped they will be recovered once the vessel is out of the water.  Jang   voiced the frustration many of the victims’ parents feel that the salvage operations have taken this long.  ”It’s the first time in three years I’ve seen the ferry with my naked eye, and it’s hard to understand why we couldn’t lift it before,” he said.  ”The priority is to find the missing bodies and do the least damage to the ship so we can find the truth and the reason it sank.”  Marathon operation, Engineers worked overnight to lift the   vessel several feet out of the water Thursday morning. Great care was taken to ensure it did not break apart.  Speaking Thursday, Lee   head of the Sewol salvaging committee, said that 450 people were working on the vessel, including 50 divers.  They are attempting to stabilize and secure the ship so it can be lifted 13 meters (42 feet) out of the water, after which it will be attached to a barge and towed to land.  Lee said the Sewol is expected to be returned to Shin Port in nearby Mokpo city around April 4, weather conditions depending.  For many of the families of the victims, the wait for answers has been agonizing.  ”My son was the 220th body to be found, after 16 days,” said Shin  . ”I can’t imagine how the children were shouting and calling for their mother and father on the ship, I feel sorry for him and at the same time I am sorry (I couldn’t be there).”  Shin said the disaster ”feels like yesterday.”  ”My days stopped on April 16, 2014. I would do anything to turn the clock back to April 15th,” he said.  National trauma, An investigation into the Sewol’s sinking found evidence of negligence by the coast guard, and in the actions of the crew and captain on the day. Survivors said the passengers were told by the Sewol’s officers to stay put as the vessel sank. And video emerged of Captain Lee   dressed only in his underwear, leaping into the arms of the Korean Coast Guard as hundreds remained trapped on the vessel. He was later convicted of murder. Family groups and opposition politicians have long called for the Sewol’s recovery and a full investigation into its sinking. The incident was a black mark on the presidency of Park   who appeared to be absent during the unfolding disaster, not addressing the nation until seven hours after the ferry began taking on water. However, Park’s impeachment this month for abuse of power was a bittersweet moment for many Sewol families, as the former President’s handling of the incident was not considered a factor by the court in her impeachment."
Slain police officer in London attack identified ,CNN,Emanuella Grinberg,2017-03-23," (CNN) Keith Palmer’s   career as a London police officer was brutally ended Wednesday by a terrorist’s knife. ”He was someone who left for work today expecting to return home at the end of his shift, and he had every right to expect that would happen,” Metropolitan Police Acting Deputy Commissioner Mark Rowley said in an evening press conference. Palmer, a    father, was one of four people killed in Britain’s most lethal terror attack since the 2005 public transit bombings. The assailant drove a car through crowds of people, injuring dozens before crashing into a fence near London’s Houses of Parliament. Witnesses said the attacker then got out of his car, brandishing the knife that he used to fatally stab Palmer. A member of the parliamentary and diplomatic protection command, Palmer was not carrying a gun,  said Rowley, Britain’s most senior counterterror police officer. Rowley added that authorities believe they know the attacker’s identity but are not releasing it, and are operating on the assumption the incident was ”  terrorism.” ’A lovely man’ Bystanders rushed to Palmer’s aid as he lay bleeding on the cobblestone street, including Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) Tobias Ellwood. But there was nothing they could do. ”Keith Palmer was killed while bravely doing his duty, protecting our city and the heart of our democracy from those who want to destroy our way of life,” London Mayor Sadiq Khan said.  ”He personifies the brave men and women of our police and emergency services who work around the clock to keep us safe    tonight all Londoners are grateful to them.” At Scotland Yard, headquarters of London’s police force, flags were flying at   on Wednesday evening, in honor of Palmer and the other victims. His death drew tributes from politicians including Conservative James Cleverly, who said he served with Palmer in the Royal Artillery before he became a ”copper.” ”A lovely man, a friend. I’m heartbroken,” Cleverly said on Twitter. The remaining victims have not been identified, other than that they were described by Rowley as ”members of the public.” French, South Koreans among injured, Three French students, one Australian and a group of South Korean tourists were among those hurt in Wednesday’s attack, which took in a popular location for sightseers. In total, police said about 40 people had been injured. The three students were from   school in Concarneau, in Western France, according to the French Foreign Ministry. They were on a school trip to London.  There was no word on the extent of their injuries. ”(Foreign Minister)   Ayrault supports the families of our compatriots concerned in this difficult time,” the statement said. Five South Korean sightseers were also injured, the country’s foreign ministry said. One man and three women in their 50s and 60s suffered fractures, while another women in her 60s needed surgery after sustaining a serious head injury. In Australia, Attorney General George Brandis told the Senate a female permanent resident from South Australia had been hospitalized after the attack, while Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Hua Chunying said a Chinese tourist was slightly injured. This story has been updated to reflect the latest number of fatalities from London Metropolitan Police."
Essential Health Benefits and why they matter,CNN,,2017-03-22," (CNN) House GOP leaders have agreed to change an Obamacare provision that guarantees all health insurers cover services such as maternity, mental health and prescription drugs. The dramatic shift would strike a blow at the heart of Obamacare, even while the GOP legislation says it protects coverage for   conditions.  The change came as an appeal to conservatives, after House Freedom Caucus members lobbied President Donald Trump this week to eliminate the provision, which was not mentioned in the GOP health care plan that House leaders originally floated.  Instead, Congress would leave it up to states to decide which benefits policies must contain. The Affordable Care Act    also known as Obamacare    requires insurers to cover 10 ”essential health benefits” in all plans sold on the individual and small group markets. It has made coverage more comprehensive and prevented insurers from selling skimpy plans that were cheap, but didn’t offer many benefits    often leaving consumers with big bills if they needed care.  Prior to the Affordable Care Act, costly items such maternity, prescription drugs, mental health and substance abuse were often not an option for many buying policies in the individual market. Removing the provision could greatly weaken the law’s protection of those with   conditions. Without the requirement to cover comprehensive policies, insurers could opt exclude some of the priciest services that sick Americans need. Carriers would also no longer have to cover annual exams and preventative tests free of charge. On the flip side, the measure has also driven up premiums and restricted consumers’ choice to buy more limited coverage. Enrollees who don’t have kids question why they have to pay for pediatric services, while those not of childbearing age argue they shouldn’t have to pay for maternity benefits. Others want to be able to once again buy ”catastrophic plans” that come with high deductibles but cover policyholders in case of serious accidents or illnesses. Republicans have long wanted to get rid of the essential health benefits provision, which is key to their pledge to reduce premiums and offer choice to consumers.  House leadership did not originally include it because doing so would likely run afoul of Senate rules governing budget reconciliation, the procedure being used to avoid a Democratic filibuster that Republicans won’t be able to break.  Jettisoning the provision was in the draft plan that was leaked last month, but did not make it into the final bill.  What’s inside the Republican health care bill? Even before Thursday’s dramatic shift, congressional Republicans and administration officials were chipping away at the mandate. The GOP bill calls for relieving states of covering the benefits in their Medicaid plans, sparking an outcry that the move would hurt efforts to treat the opioid epidemic.  Also, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price told House Republicans last week that he plans to weaken the provision by changing the regulations governing it. While the 10 benefits are spelled out in the law, the health secretary wields a lot of power over how the provision is actually implemented. Maternity coverage could be high on the list to be watered down. Seema Verma, who runs the Centers for Medicaid  Medicare Services, said during her congressional hearing that she doesn’t think the benefit should be required in every policy.  "
Why popularity means nothing in race to be Hong Kong’s leader,CNN,James Griffiths,2017-03-22,"Hong Kong (CNN) It’s campaign season in Hong Kong, and on the streets of the city’s Wan Chai district, John Tsang is getting mobbed.  Moustachioed and   the former financial secretary poses for selfie after selfie with shoppers in a busy street market.  It’s all a bit of a shock for the lifelong bureaucrat, previously best known for repeatedly flubbing his predictions for the city’s economic growth and blogging about soccer.  ”Everywhere I go, I get really good, friendly reception from citizens of Hong Kong who I have never met,” he told CNN.  He has reason to want to be popular. Tsang    known as ”Mr Pringles” for his resemblance to the snack logo    is currently standing to be the city’s next Chief Executive.  According to a recent poll by the South China Morning Post, Tsang is 14 points clear of his nearest rival for the job, Carrie Lam.  Despite this however, Lam is firm favorite to win Sunday’s contest. Because in Hong Kong    despite the polls, the public debates, and the political advertising littering the streets    most people don’t get a vote.  Only 1, 194 people    0. 01% of the population    on a ”broadly representative” election committee get to choose who becomes the city’s next leader.  Scrapping the committee    which is dominated by   interests and toes the Party line    was a key demand of the ”Umbrella Movement”   protests which shut down parts of the city for months in 2014.  Joshua Wong, one of the leaders of the 2014 protests, told CNN the ”most important thing for us in the short term” is to fight for the right to vote for the next Chief Executive.  He vowed to return to the streets if the political reform process is not resumed.  Finish line, In a televised debate last week, Lam acknowledged the importance of public opinion.  ”I trust Hong Kong people 100%. So when the mainstream opinion is different from mine, I will definitely accept Hong Kong people’s opinion,” she said. ”If public opinion renders me unsuitable to serve as chief executive, I will resign.” Lam    CNN has requested an interview    knows from experience the difficulties of governing a city that has turned against its leader.  She served as deputy to Hong Kong’s outgoing Chief Executive CY Leung, whose approval rating fell from 56. 5 points in his first months in office in 2012, to 35 points this year, according to regular surveys by Hong Kong University.  Leung was a surprise dark horse winner against early favorite Henry Tang in 2012, who was brought down by revelations he built an enormous basement in his home without planning permission. Leung, a former surveyor, squeaked through the election committee with just 689 votes, a total that would later become his mocking nickname. That lack of widespread support even among the elite hurt Leung, who faced repeated mass protests throughout his tenure, said Duncan   Asia regional director for the Economist Intelligence Unit. ”Some Beijing officials appear to feel that the relatively narrow margin of victory that Leung secured served to undermine his legitimacy,” he said. That may dash Tsang’s hopes of a surprise win, as Beijing will want to ensure Leung’s successor has the clear support of the commission,   said.  ”John Tsang’s tactic positioning himself as the popular choice has echoes of the 2012 race,” he added. ”(But) Carrie Lam has not faced any scandals of similar impact.” Not that Lam has been  . One of her last actions as deputy leader was to approve a controversial Hong Kong version of the Palace Museum, in Beijing’s ancient Forbidden City.  The plan was announced without public consultation, and critics quickly seized on a giant advert for the museum    which depicted the gates of the Forbidden City in front of Tiananmen Square    to stage protests calling for justice for the Tiananmen massacre of 4 June 1989. Lam has also been hurt by a perception that she is out of touch with ordinary Hong Kongers. During a tour of the city’s subway system, she was filmed apparently not knowing how to use the turnstile. Days later, she admitted to having to return to an official government residence she was supposed to have vacated because her new apartment had run out of toilet paper and she didn’t know where to buy any at night. (Hong Kong has numerous 24 hour supermarkets and corner shops.)  Lam did not respond to a request for comment about her popularity with the public. Popular vote, While Tsang    a lifelong bureaucrat who has met with senior Chinese leaders including President Xi Jinping    is hardly an   choice, he has attracted support from   legislators and called for the way Hong Kong’s leader is chosen to be reformed. ”I think for Hong Kong to choose a chief executive that the general population would have trust in, would support, I think that is a very important step,” he told CNN. ”We all want to have universal suffrage . .. and this is also something important for the next chief executive because someone who is voted in by the general population would have mandate that a small circle election would not provide.” Lam did not respond to a request for comment about future political reform.  Whoever Hong Kong’s next Chief Executive is, he or she is likely to get an early taste of 2014’s ”Umbrella Movement.”  The Chief Executive’s   date on July 1 will coincide with the 20th anniversary of Hong Kong’s handover from the UK to China. According to local media, around 30, 000 police have begun preparing for a potential visit by President Xi, which Wong and others predict will induce huge protests.  ”The fight isn’t over,” Wong said. ”We’re ready to get back the chance to vote in the election. Don’t just implement selection, we need election.”"
Japan PM Shinzo Abe embroiled in land-sale scandal,CNN,Joshua Berlinger,2017-03-22,"Tokyo (CNN) An educator accused of using his clout to curry favor with Japanese politicians, including the first family, told lawmakers under oath Thursday that he believes political intervention helped him secure a deal to purchase land from the government. Yasunori Kagoike was called in to testify about his Moritomo Gakuen group’s land purchase from the government in June. The group, which runs schools in Japan, paid   the price of the plot’s assessed value, according to a public copy of the land sale. More than $7 million was lopped off for waste removal, a discount that raised eyebrows throughout the country. Kagoike, who has been accused of promoting extreme nationalist views, appeared in parliament to answer lawmakers’ questions over whether he used his connections with some   politicians    including Prime Minister Shinzo Abe    to secure the discount for Moritomo Gakuen. Moritomo Gakuen planned to build a school on the site. In his testimony, Kagoike said he believes there was some sort of political intervention in the transaction because the process started moving quicker once he began asking for help. He later clarified what he meant at a news conference with reporters, saying that he believes people working for Abe    specifically bureaucrats in the Ministry of Finance, which sold him the land    helped in the sale. He did not name specific people.  ”I don’t think there is direct influence from Prime Minister Abe,” Kagoike said, according to the   translator supplied by The Foreign Correspondents’ Club of Japan, which hosted the news conference. The discount was fair, Kagoike said, though he stressed it was the federal government’s decision to reduce the price. ”(It) was not out of the bounds of reality. It took a lot of money to take out the household waste in the land and replace it with good soil,” he said. Prime Minister Abe denies any connection to the land sale, and says he’ll step down if it’s proven otherwise. ”I have no understanding about the details of what this school is doing,” he said in a session of parliament in February. ”I only took a brief look at their brochure.” Kagoike said he’s withdrawn the application to build the school at the advice of his lawyer despite the fact that construction is almost finished. ”It was a heartbreaking moment,” he said. ”But after that nothing has improved . .. (the) government acted like I am the only bad guy. I’m starting to find it strange.” The scandal has for now put a serious dent in Abe’s reputation. His Cabinet’s approval rating has fallen 10 percentage points since last month to 56% according to an opinion poll conducted Saturday and Sunday in The Yomiuri Shimbun, a Japanese newspaper. It’s the largest decline since December 2012, when Abe’s second Cabinet took office, according to the newspaper. The Moritomo Gakuen group declined to speak with CNN. Representatives for the Abes did not give specific answers to CNN’s inquiries, instead pointing to public comments the Prime Minister has made. The honorary principal, Abe’s wife, Akie, was a prominent supporter of the planned school, serving as ”honorary principal” until her abrupt resignation last month. Her picture and title were listed on the school’s website but have since taken down. Abe told parliament in February his wife resigned due to ”various incidents,” without going into more detail. ”She thought being honorary principal could result in giving trouble to children and parents,” he told lawmakers. But Kagoike told reporters and politicians the Abes have been supporters of his for a while. He claims Akie Abe donated 1 million yen (about $8, 900) on her husband’s behalf to Moritomo Gakuen in 2015    something the Prime Minister has denied himself and through his spokesman. The donation isn’t necessarily illegal, but if verified it would mean Abe misled lawmakers in a session of parliament. ”I have no idea why he (Kagoike) has said this,” Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said. During his testimony, Kagoike said Akie Abe gave him the donation when she came to one of his schools to give a speech on September 5, 2015. Akie Abe asked her aide to leave the room during a meeting and then gave him an envelope with the money inside, Kagoike said in his testimony. ”(The donation) was a great honor for us, so we remember it very vividly,” he said. The only piece of hard evidence Kagoike offered was a copy of a fax, but it only proves he communicated with Akie Abe’s aide. The document says Kagoike’s request couldn’t be met but the aide said they would let him know if they could help.    Akie Abe took to Facebook on March 23 to deny the allegations.  ”I have never given a donation of 1 million yen to Mr. Kagoike, nor received a lecture fee. As for this point, I have been exchanging   with Mrs. Kagoike many times since February, but she has not mentioned that there was a donation or that I received a lecture fee. I clearly communicated to her that I had no memory to that effect,” she said. ” I don’t ask my secretary to leave when I visit for speeches and lectures. I would not do such a thing. I have confirmed with my two secretaries that I have not done such a thing.” The Prime Minister’s ruling Liberal Democrat Party jumped on this as an opportunity to discredit Kagoike’s testimony. If Akie Abe and Kagoike were alone and the cash was exchanged, there’s no way Kagoike could conclusively prove his account about the donation, Prime Minister Abe’s allies said. Suga again denied allegations Thursday that either of the Abes made a donation to Moritomo Gakuen after Kagoike’s testimony. He said the government will not ask Akie Abe about it again and reiterated his belief the land deal was done in a fair and legal manner. Shinzo Abe said Friday it was ”extremely regrettable” Kagoike made what the Prime Minister says were false claims about a   conversation that is difficult to prove. Kagoike said he’s now the victim of a ”malicious and libelous” smear campaign. ”There’s a lot of hysteria around this situation, we’re being targeted by people,” he told reporters Thursday. ’My way of thinking’ The scandal first broke in February after a local assembly member sued the government for not disclosing the details of the sale.  The Prime Minister was fielding questions about the school by the middle of February, when he denied any connection to the transaction. But he told lawmakers his wife said Kagoike is a passionate educator who shares his ”way of thinking very much.” Kagoike said the Abes support his school’s philosophy during his Thursday testimony. ”I wonder why the people who has been supportive to my school suddenly turned their back and left me alone,” he said. ”I won’t be cast off like the tail of lizard.” This has caused concern among the Japanese public, as officials at Kagoike’s Moritomo Gakuen have been accused of using derogatory language when referring to Chinese and Korean people in letters home to parents. A note on one school’s website blamed ”delinquent parents” of ”former students coming from C country and K country” for making the letter public. ”Our school stands firm against such actions by those extreme minority from C country and K country living in Japan,” Moritomo Gakuen said on its website. ”C Country” and ”K country” likely refer to China and South Korea. The school group eventually took down the note and issued an apology on its website for their ”misleading expressions.” Moritomo Gakuen also requires its students to recite Imperial Rescript of Education, a relic of Japan’s imperial era education system that deifies the Emperor. Today, reciting the rescript is seen by some in the Japanese public as glorifying the history of Japanese aggression. Kagoike said Thursday rescript is ”something that is useful for the moral education of children.” He said he does not believe it is linked to militarism, and that his organization is not hateful.  The accusations, however, strike a chord with Abe’s opponents, who believe the Prime Minister himself has been too cavalier when it comes to Japan’s history, The defense minister’s connection to Moritomo Gakuen, Tomomi Inada, who is believed to be Abe    has also found herself embroiled in the scandal. She denies any connection to the land sale. Inada did not answer CNN’s questions about whether she supported the group’s educational policies. Inada told opposition lawmakers she did not have a relationship with Kagoike or his company when she was asked about the scandal in parliament last week. But Japanese media uncovered court records showing Inada, a lawyer, represented Moritomo Gakuen during a trial in 2004.  Inada later confirmed she attended the trial in place of her husband, another lawyer, when their firm was representing the group.  Shuji Akiba, an official at the Defense Ministry, told CNN this was the only case Inada worked on for Moritomo Gakuen. The contract between the law firm and the Moritomo Gakuen ended in 2009. Inada apologized for the mistake, but opposition lawmakers say she should resign for making a false statement while in a parliament session. Inada has acknowledged her error and wants to now focus on her duties as defense minister, Akiba said. Inada hasn’t been in touch with Kagoike in 10 years, according to Akiba.

Chinese officials warned US bomber,CNN,Ryan Browne,2017-03-22,"Washington (CNN) Chinese officials warned a US military aircraft flying near South Korea Sunday, telling its pilots that they were illegally operating in Chinese airspace and ordering the American plane to leave, a US defense official told CNN. The pilots of the US Air Force   Lancer bomber responded to the Chinese air traffic controllers, saying that they were conducting routine operations in international airspace and did not deviate from their flight path, according to US Pacific Air Forces spokesman Maj. Phil Ventura. The bombers had entered a controversial Chinese Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) in the East China Sea, which covers a disputed island chain and overlaps with airspace claimed by Japan and South Korea.   The ADIZ declaration required airlines flying over the designated waters to first notify Chinese authorities before transiting. The US and Japanese governments do not recognize China’s claim on the area.  ”Pacific Air Forces . .. did not recognize the Chinese Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) when it was announced in November of 2013, and does not recognize it today,” Ventura told CNN. ”The ADIZ has not changed our operations.” On Thursday, China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman said she wasn’t aware of the specific incident but said that setting up an ADIZ was the right of a sovereign nation.  ”The United States has its own ADIZ. The US should respect the right of other countries to set up ADIZ,” spokeswoman Hua Chunying said.  China established the zone despite objections from Tokyo and Washington. A US report from last year suggested that it was not being fully enforced.  Tensions have flared numerous times over the Senkaku Islands, which China calls Diaoyu Islands, including   between Japanese and Chinese warplanes and ships. The US plane was flying 70 nautical miles southwest of South Korea’s Jeju Island. According to the US Air Force, the     bomber was conducting a series of training missions with Japanese and South Korean military aircraft.  ”Our increased cooperation enables our combined forces to rapidly react to counter aggression against Japan and other allies and partners,” said US Maj. Ryan Simpson, the Pacific Air Forces bomber operations chief, in a statement announcing the training mission. "
Student in Maryland rape case undocumented,CNN,,2017-03-21," (CNN) News that one of the two Maryland high school students accused of raping a schoolmate was allegedly in the country unlawfully has caught the attention of the White House. The student,    Henry   was arrested Thursday at Rockville High School in Rockville, Maryland, along with    classmate Jose Montano. Both students are being charged as adults with   rape and two counts each of committing a   sexual offense, Montgomery County Police said. Andrew Jezic, attorney for   told CNN on Friday, his client will plead not guilty because ”this was a   consensual and   encounter.” ”There were no scratches, no bruises. There was no hitting, there was no screaming, there was no running immediately to some sort of security officer,” Jezic said. Following  ’s arrest, ICE issued an immigration detainer, an order to local law enforcement to hold a suspect for a pending immigration review.  Jezic believes his client will be acquitted in a jury trial and plans to claim asylum for   following the criminal proceedings. ”My client and his brother fled gang violence in Guatemala,” Jezic said. The crime, which took place some 20 miles from the White House in a school district where many members of Congress and federal officials live, comes amid heightened scrutiny of undocumented immigrants. Last month, President Donald Trump directed the Department of Homeland Security to create an office tasked with focusing on crimes allegedly committed by undocumented immigrants.  Asked about the story at a Tuesday briefing, White House press secretary Sean Spicer called the crime ”horrendous and horrible and disgusting.” ”I think part of the reason the president has made illegal immigration and crackdown such a big deal is because of tragedies like this,” he said. But school officials rejected the notion that the incident has national implications. ”While some would try to make this into a question and issue of immigration, what comes down here is we serve every student who walks through our door,” said Jack R. Smith, superintendent of the Montgomery County Public Schools. ”We are a public school system, and we serve all of our students when they come to us.” ”People choose to do very bad things,” Smith said at a Tuesday afternoon news conference. ”Mostly, they don’t choose to do them in schools, but sometimes they do. And that is horrible, it’s unacceptable, its tragic, but schools    relative to the rest of the world    are among the most safe places we can be in our community. ” Spicer nonetheless called for a review of school guidelines.  ”The President recognizes that education is a   and a   issue but I think it is    it is cause for concern, what happened there. And I think that the city should look at its policies and I think that this is something that authorities are going to have to look at.”      In his response, the press secretary also characterized the victim as a person who chose to come to America legally.  ”This young woman, in particular, fought to come to this country legally because of the freedoms and the treasures of this nation,” he said. ”And to think that this kind of tragedy would occur to someone who’s personally endured that kind of struggle to come to this nation and then face this is reprehensible.” On that point, however, Montgomery County Police Capt. James Humphries called the White House’s narrative into question. ”I have no information that she is anything other than a US citizen,” he said of the unnamed victim. ”There’s no information at all that she has any kind of immigrant status whatsoever.” Matthew Bourke, a spokesman for ICE, said   a citizen of Guatemala, was stopped by a border patrol agent in Rio Grande Valley, Texas, in August 2016. Bourke said   was detained for 12 days before being placed with the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which reunited him with his family in Maryland.  ’s attorney Jezic told CNN his client was held for 12 or 13 days by ICE, though he previously stated his client was held for four weeks. Jezic added that it took   eight days to get from Guatemala to the southern border in McAllen, Texas, where he encountered border patrol. Jezic also confirmed that  ’s family paid for the   flight from Texas.  At that time, the agent determined that   was in the United States illegally, having crossed over from Mexico without proper documentation.   was ordered to appear before an immigration judge. That hearing has yet to be scheduled.   ”ICE fully vetted him. They determined that he wasn’t a gang member and didn’t have a criminal record in his country,” Jezic told CNN. ”He didn’t have a criminal record here. He hadn’t been deported before. He had no gang ties.” Bourke said such a delay in an immigration hearing was ”not atypical” and that   had been free to travel in the interim. ”There are a lot of people waiting to see an immigration judge,” he said.  According to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University, more than half a million cases are pending in immigration courts across the United States. ICE officials would not comment on Montano’s citizenship, citing his age.  The alleged rape took place in a school bathroom on March 16.  According to the alleged victim, the younger of the two suspects solicited her for sex in a school hallway. When she refused, he forced her into a boy’s bathroom. Both the suspects then allegedly raped her inside a bathroom stall.    is due in court on April 14. Montano has a hearing scheduled for March 31."

"Officer, 3 others die in Wisconsin shootings",CNN,,2017-03-23," (CNN) Three civilians and a police officer were killed Wednesday in a shooting incident in northern Wisconsin, Everest Metropolitan Police Chief Wally Sparks said.   Police said the shootings occurred at three locations in the Wausau area. The officer, from the Everest Metropolitan Police Department in Schofield, was killed in the line of duty, Sparks said. The name of the officer was not released.    ”This was one suspect, at this point in time. He has been taken into custody,” Sparks said at a media briefing where he did not take questions.  Sparks did not provide a possible motive for the shooting, and said the Wisconsin Department of Justice’s Division of Criminal Investigations is handling the investigation. Jason Smith of the DCI said the investigation is complex. It is not clear precisely where the four fatalities occurred. CNN affiliates WJFW, WAOW and WSAW reported the shootings took place at a bank in Rothschild, a law office in Schofield and an apartment in Weston.  ”This is a complex, ongoing investigation involving three crime scenes and multiple victims of shootings at those locations,” Wausau Police Capt. Todd Baeten said. He declined to provide additional details."
London after attack: Shocked then enraged,CNN,Lauren Said-Moorhouse,2017-03-23,"London (CNN) The big red buses sit abandoned on the bridge, six of them. Nearby are two black taxicabs, also empty. No passengers, no drivers, no pedestrians.  This is not normal. This is the opposite of normal. This is Westminster Bridge, linking Britain’s Houses of Parliament to the South Bank, where tourists line up to ride the London Eye Ferris wheel.  This area is rarely still, and never on a spring Wednesday afternoon. It should be packed with visitors, locals and the occasional parliamentarian.  Of course, it’s not still even now. Slowly, then overwhelmingly, the noise takes over the senses    a cacophony of sirens and chaos.  This is London in the wake of a terror attack. An attacker, named by police as    British man Khalid Masood, rammed pedestrians along the popular walkway, before crashing the perimeter railing outside Parliament, the heart of British political life. Taking off on foot, the assailant continued his rampage, stabbing to death a police officer before he was killed.  Four people died in addition to the attacker at least 50 more victims were injured, authorities say.  ”I saw a car, the crunch of car hitting the curb. I kind of thought the guy had maybe had a heart attack or something,”    Rob Lyon tells CNN. ”It hit several people. I jumped out the way into a road, (my) colleagues jumped the other way towards the Thames but held on, thankfully.”  The campaign director from Rugby, a town in central England, witnessed the assault at Westminster as he and colleagues were walking across the bridge. He says he expected the car to hit the bridge wall but it continued, deliberately mowing down people on the sidewalk.  ”I stood in shock and saw carnage around me and the car carrying on up the bridge.” He describes how initially he stood frozen to the spot the woman in front of him badly hurt. He removed his jacket offering it to her as a pillow, while others tried to help.  Lockdown descends upon this central part of London as police hurriedly tape off the maze of connecting streets. Those who work close by are told to return to their buildings or leave the area throngs of vacationers are ushered back by officers donning fluorescent yellow jackets. Despite the sun, it’s still a cold March day.  Outside Westminster Abbey    the iconic Gothic cathedral normally a gathering point for celebrations like William and Kate’s glamorous royal wedding in 2011     is Craig Meichan. A    student from the town of Ormskirk, near Liverpool, he stands with four friends, his phone in hand.  Meichan, along with 15 others, has just left the Houses of Parliament, a stop on his college trip’s itinerary. Now he’s searching for his missing friends.  ”(It) sounded like a car backfiring,” he says of the bloody end to the attack. ”Police began shouting and they started cordoning off the area.” As he speaks, the words seem to tumble out of his mouth.  When the yelling and sirens filled the air, Meichan says his group was separated into three. He didn’t know where his tutor was he hopes she has been locked inside the building. He says he’s worried some of his friends have gone toward the bridge to take photos.  ”I’m a bit shaken up. You never expect this to happen to you,” he explains, his hands trembling.  Meanwhile, curious bystanders have gathered next to the police tape, their phones thrust into the air to document the empty square ahead. Two helicopters hover above Westminster Bridge, a third circles the wider area. Sirens continue in the distance. Flocks of people are leaving work early. Students from the exclusive Westminster School a few blocks away, easily identifiable by their uniforms, are strolling along and watching the crowds with interest. Outside pubs, some workers gather rather than joining the melee of wandering commuters. And there’s only one topic of conversation.  With red and blue tape blocking off every road in the immediate vicinity, commuters struggle to find an alternative route home. Many are on their phones typing text messages or checking in with calls to loved ones. Otherwise the streets are eerily silent.  As dusk falls on London, we make our way across Lambeth Bridge at the other end of the Westminster area. It’s the only place nearby that we are able to cross the river to the south.  Police at the bridge say they are only allowing people to cross over but not return toward the city. Pedestrians must go around another way.  Emergency response vehicles continue to stream past every few minutes.   London Ambulance Service vehicles are parked in a barrier across the south end of Westminster Bridge and in front of St. Thomas’ Hospital. Up ahead, blue flashing lights signal where people in white   bodysuits have come to examine the scene.  Details will continue to emerge over the coming hours and days. But already emotions are turning from shock to anger.  Rob Lyon’s first thought was to return home to Rugby    to his wife    but after hearing the incident was a likely terror attack, he defiantly says he’s going to remain in the city to continue the business trip he set out on.  ”Initially I think I was shocked, quite emotional speaking to my wife about the near miss I had,” he says.  ”I think I’m in an anger phase just because someone purposely drove a car at me. ”I’m sure there’s more shock to come further down the road.” Editor’s note: This story has been updated to reflect the latest number of fatalities from London Metropolitan Police."
Kochs pledge millions to GOPers in 2018 -- if they vote no on health care bill,CNN,Theodore Schleifer,2017-03-23,"Washington (CNN) In a   effort to sink the Republican health care bill, a powerful network of conservative donors said Wednesday it would create a new fund for Republican 2018 reelection races    but they’ll only open it up to GOPers who vote against the bill. The advocacy groups helmed by Charles and David Koch have unveiled a new pool of money for advertisements, field programs and mailings that would exclude those who vote for the health care bill they oppose on Thursday. The effort, which they described as worth millions of dollars, is an explicit warning to    Republicans from one of the most influential players in electoral politics not to cross them. The   networks oppose the bill because they think it does not do enough to scale back former President Barack Obama’s health care policies. ”We want to make certain that lawmakers understand the policy consequences of voting for a law that keeps Obamacare intact,” Americans for Prosperity president Tim Phillips said. ”We have a history of following up and holding politicians accountable, but we will also be there to support and thank the champions who stand strong and keep their promise.” The vote is not a litmus test: Other money and resources would still be available to Republicans who do not vote with the network, formally called the Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce. But those who vote with the network will have access to more.  The vote in the House is expected Thursday, though more than 20 Republicans had said as of late Wednesday that they planned to vote against it, which would kill the legislation. President Donald Trump and his allies in the House have been frantically whipping as many   votes as they can, and Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows showed openness to working with the White House late Wednesday. Trump, House leaders, conservatives working on health care deal, The Kochs typically support Republican congressional candidates in competitive races, though they have withheld their volunteers and advertising in the past when they felt snubbed by a particular candidate, such as Kelly Ayotte, the New Hampshire senator who lost her reelection battle in 2016 and did not receive Koch funding for much of the race. The network has also grown increasingly comfortable with wading into Republican primaries. Network donors have been skittish about advertising against GOP candidates in the past, though Koch officials said last year that they were inching in that direction and to expect more primary fights in the future. What are Republicans thinking? 3 possible scenarios on Obamacare, The Koch network has tiptoed toward confrontation with Trump in the opening months of his presidency. More ideologically pure than the   White House, they have been critical of his travel bans and have been uneasy with a support for protectionism, but have spent some of their sums to boost Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch and have applauded his attempts to scale back federal regulations. The group of   donors plans to spend between $300 million and $400 million on political projects over the 2018 cycle. Trump’s health care triumvirate: Pence, Price and Mulvaney"
"White stabbing suspect targeted black men, police say",CNN,Shachar Peled,2017-03-23," (CNN) A    man was stabbed to death in Manhattan late Monday, police said, for one reason: being black. In the early hours of Wednesday morning, James Harris Jackson walked into an NYPD substation in Times Square and announced that he was responsible for Timothy Caughman’s death. ”I’m the person you’re looking for,” he said, adding that he had knives in his pocket. The    Baltimore, Maryland resident took a bus to New York on March 17 with the goal of targeting black men, according to NYPD Assistant Chief, Bill Aubry. Jackson is being charged with   murder.  ”The attack was clearly racially motivated,” Aubry said Wednesday. ”It’s well over 10 years he has been harboring these feelings of hate towards male blacks.” Aubry said that Jackson randomly singled out Caughman and stabbed him in the back multiple times while Caughman was going through garbage on a Manhattan sidewalk.  After the attack, Caughman stumbled into the Midtown South Precinct in critical condition, police said. He later died of his injuries at Bellevue Hospital. Surveillance video shows Jackson running away from the scene after the stabbing. He later saw himself on the news and decided to surrender to a police officer, Aubry said. Cuomo appalled by ’senseless murder’ New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo was one of a number of political leaders who expressed outrage at the alleged racial motivation of the crime. ”Like all New Yorkers, I am appalled by the senseless murder of Timothy Caughman,” Cuomo said in a statement. ”In New York, no one should feel unsafe for who they are, and this despicable attack on one New Yorker is an attack on all New Yorkers.” ”More than an unspeakable human tragedy, this is an assault on what makes this the greatest city in the world: our inclusiveness and our diversity,” New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a statement. Sherrilyn Ifill, the President and   of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, said on Twitter that the incident was a ”terrorist attack.”  Jackson told police that he picked New York because it is the media capital of the world and he wanted to make a statement. He had previously served in the military and deployed to Afghanistan, Aubry said police records show. Aubry also mentioned a 2013 interaction Jackson had with law enforcement. ”At this time, there is no connection of any crime involving (the) suspect here in Baltimore,” T. J. Smith of the Baltimore Police Department said, adding that the BPD are keeping watch outside Jackson’s home and expecting an NYPD investigation in town. Aubry said police are working to add a hate crime or racially motivated crime to upgrade the   murder charge to   murder.  ”He knew what he was doing when he was coming up here,” Aubry said. ”We’re fortunate it stopped at one and it wasn’t more.”"
India becomes second country to give rivers human status,CNN,,2017-03-22,"New Delhi (CNN) A   fight against river pollution in India has been given a much needed boost.  On Monday, a court in the Himalayan state of Uttarakhand declared the Yamuna and Ganges rivers ”living entities.”  The court justified its ruling on the grounds that the rivers were ”losing their very existence” and the situation required ”extraordinary measures to be taken to preserve and conserve the Rivers Ganga and Yamuna,” using an alternative name for the Ganges.  The ruling said the rivers, both of which are considered sacred to Hindus and personified as goddesses, were crucial in providing ”physical and spiritual sustenance” to locals. Suresh Kumar Rohilla, an expert on urban water management at Indian NGO the Center for Science and Environment, said it was unclear how the court’s decision would get translated on the ground.  ”Any efforts to strengthen water quality (in the Ganges) are appreciated,” he said. ”Policy level efforts earlier hadn’t brought results.”  Human status, The Indian court’s move comes a week after New Zealand’s Whanganui River became the first river in the world to be granted human status. Maoris had been trying for a century to have their relationship with the river acknowledged by the government.  Under the Whanganui River Claims Settlement Bill, two people will act on behalf of the river and work to promote and protect its wellbeing. The ruling in India echoed this, appointing three government officials as ”legal guardians” of the rivers. But Rohilla warned that it would not be a simple fix. ”Ultimately courts can’t clean rivers,” he said, adding that people and government needed to take joint responsibility for protecting the waters. Lifelines, The Ganges originates in the Gangotri Glacier in the Himalayas, and flows nearly 2, 520 kilometers( 1,570 miles) through India and Bangladesh. It serves as a lifeline for millions of Indians who live along its banks. The same goes for the Yamuna, which travels 1, 375 kilometers (855 miles) before merging with the Ganges and the Saraswati River at Triveni Sangam, known as the confluence of three rivers, in India’s northern Uttar Pradesh state, and the site for the Kumbh Mela, the world’s largest religious festival. The Yamuna provides drinking water for millions of Delhi’s 19 million residents. But by the time it leaves the eastern side of the capital, it is the dirtiest river in India.    NGO WaterAid said in a report this week that more than 63 million Indians are without access to clean drinking water. Over the years, attempts to meet demands for fresh water from an ever growing population have proven difficult for the Indian government.  Earlier this year, it allocated $291 million to 20 projects under the Clean Ganga initiative. Most of the money will go towards building sewage treatment plants and upgrading infrastructure."
Nunes: Trump communications may have been collected,CNN,Stephen Collinson,2017-03-22," (CNN) House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes set off a stunning new political controversy Wednesday by revealing that communications of President Donald Trump and associates may have been picked up after the election by intelligence agencies conducting surveillance of foreign targets. Nunes hurried to the White House to personally brief Trump on the revelations, after talking to the press but without sharing the information with Democrats. His Democratic counterpart on the committee    Rep. Adam Schiff of California    warned that his colleague had cast a ”profound cloud” over their effort to investigate Russian attempts to interfere in the election. A Republican source with knowledge of the situation claimed the information that Nunes talked about was from the intelligence community and not the White House. The source said Nunes was ”steaming” about what he read. That source said Nunes met with Republican members of the Intelligence Committee before his news conference, and several tried to convince him not to do it before he spoke with Schiff. But Nunes didn’t take the advice, with the news conference already called by the time he met with the GOP committee members. Nunes was too mad, the source said.   The comments by Nunes do not appear to support Trump’s claims, debunked by FBI Director James Comey, that he was wiretapped by his predecessor President Barack Obama. Rather, they appear to relate to conversations between Trump or associates and people who were targeted by FISA warrants    that Nunes said did not appear to be illegal. But the President was asked by reporters if he feels vindicated by the visit from Nunes and answered: ”I somewhat do. I must tell you I somewhat do, I very much appreciated the fact that they found what they found.” Another day of shocking drama intensified the intrigue and uncertainty sparked by Trump’s feud with intelligence agencies, his accusations of shady practices by his predecessor and the wider question of the Trump campaign’s links with Russia that are currently the focus of an investigation by the FBI. Nunes told reporters the conversations were ”incidentally” collected as part of intelligence sweeps focusing on other people and implied that Trump was not the target of the surveillance operation. He said he discovered accounts of conversations related to Trump and his associates when he was reviewing intelligence reports brought to him by an unidentified person    and said the information was not related to Russia. ”This is a normal, incidental collection, based on what I could collect,” Nunes said. ”This appears to be all legally collected foreign intelligence under” the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Nevertheless, Nunes said he alerted House Speaker Paul Ryan about the collection before he headed to the White House, adding: ”I’m actually alarmed by it.” Democrats on the committee said they were not informed of Nunes’ finding before he spoke with the media.  Generally, American citizens who are caught up in surveillance of foreign targets are not identified by name in intelligence reports. But Nunes’ announcement raises the question of whether the   or associates were identified in intelligence reports circulating in the covert community. A House member on the Intelligence Committee told CNN the communications in question were   people talking about Trump, not Trump himself.  Nunes later told CNN’s ”The Lead with Jake Tapper” that ”  Trump and his team were put into intelligence reports.” ”Clearly there is a lot of information in the reports that I’ve seen, which were dozens, that would lead me to believe that the last administration and numerous agencies had a pretty good idea of what   Trump was up to and what his transition team was up to and who they were meeting with,” Nunes told Tapper. Democrats in the dark, In a news conference, Schiff expressed deep concern that committee members were not told by Nunes about the revelations before he briefed the press or went to the White House. ”If the chairman is going to continue to go to the White House instead of his own committee, there is no way we can continue to conduct this investigation,” he said. ”It does underscore the importance of establishing an independent commission,” Schiff said. Schiff said that he and other members of the committee had still not seen the documents that Nunes was referring to. He also said from a conversation with Nunes that there did not appear to have been any ”unmasking” of any of the US people mentioned in the intercepts. ”All of us are in the dark.”  Nunes defended rushing to brief the President because the reports he read have nothing to do with Russia, but he said the investigation he is conducting into Russian interference in the election would look at how Trump’s name got into the intelligence reports. ”Because what I saw has nothing to do with Russia and has nothing to do with the Russian investigations, (and) has everything to do with possible surveillance activities . .. the President needs to know these intelligence reports are out there and I have a duty to tell him that,” Nunes said. But in an interview with CNN’s Kate Bolduan on ”Erin Burnett OutFront,” Democratic Rep. Jackie Speier slammed Nunes as a ”presidential whisperer” undermining the committee’s investigation and accused the White House of planning the day’s events. ”This was pure theater,” Speier said. ”I think in many respects it was probably orchestrated by the White House.” Still no sign of wiretapping  Two weeks ago, Trump asked Congress to investigate whether Trump Tower was wiretapped by his predecessor.  On Monday, Nunes’ committee held a hearing featuring Comey and National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers. At that hearing, Comey confirmed for the first time that his agency is investigating possible collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign and whether any crimes may have been committed during last year’s election campaign as part of a wider probe into the hacking of Democratic servers and the Clinton campaign. Also at that hearing, Comey said he had seen no evidence so far of the specific allegation of wiretapping Trump Tower. RELATED: Actually, Mr. President, wiretapping doesn’t cover a lot of things, Nunes at his news conference said he did not know whether the ”incidental collection” happened at Trump Tower, and could not say for certain whether Trump’s communications were directly collected. He said the collection included Trump transition officials and that it happened after the election.  UPDATED CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated whom Nunes met with before his news conference. He met Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee. "
Hill GOP moderates buck their leaders and Trump,CNN,MJ Lee,2017-03-24,"Washington (CNN) The Republican Party’s reputation was on the line, but a group of moderates were prepared to defy not only House Speaker Paul Ryan but President Donald Trump on the GOP’s first major legislative priority to repeal Obamacare. In the end, they didn’t have to vote at all. Just hours before the bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act was pulled from the floor Friday, moderates were still coming out to publicly oppose it, a sign to leadership that some of their more loyal foot soldiers wouldn’t be with them in the end.    House Appropriations Chairman Rodney Frelinghuysen’s said on Facebook he was against the bill. Rep. Barbara Comstock, a party stalwart, also announced she was opposed Friday.  As it became clearer throughout the day that House leaders didn’t have the votes, moderates become less and less willing to walk the plank for a bill they feared would die in the House or be killed in the Senate. Changes appealed to conservatives, and scared moderates, For some moderates, the   deal hatched between the White House and the conservative House Freedom Caucus Wednesday night to repeal the essential benefits that insurers are required to offer consumers had gone too far. One GOP source told CNN that while leaders had gotten a few firm commitments coming from conservatives, they’d seen an exodus of moderates in part because of the deal. For moderates in tough districts back home, the campaign ads would have written themselves. The overhauled GOP repeal bill included a provision that stripped away federal requirements that insurers provide benefits like maternity care, prescription drug coverage and hospital stays and delegated those decisions to the states.  Rep. Leonard Lance, a New Jersey Republican, told CNN Friday morning that without a doubt, the decision to concede the repeal of essential health benefits to the Freedom Caucus had moved some of his colleagues to ”no.”  ”I suspect some became a ’no’ because of that,” Lance said. ”That certainly didn’t help.” While so much of the focus over the last week had centered on the louder, more visible House Freedom Caucus, the fear that moderates would abandon House leaders en masse had been a top concern behind the scenes.  Rep. Charlie Dent, a consistent ally for leaders, came out against the bill after a tense meeting in Ryan’s office Wednesday night and there were more members who never said publicly where they stood on the bill.  Because Republicans chose to make the change to the benefits so late in the game, moderates feared that they were walking in blind to what the effects of repealing them could be. ”A lot of people don’t realize what the implications of that are,” one moderate member said of stripping out essential health benefits Thursday. ”So we’re going to railroad this thing through and there’s going to be even more people pissed off    our constituents, stakeholders.” Members would have been voting without an analysis from the   Congressional Budget Office of what the budgetary and coverage impact of repealing essential health benefits would have been and moderates had already been spooked by the CBO analysis the first time around, which showed 24 million more people would have been without insurance by 2026 if the GOP leadership’s bill had passed.  On Friday morning, just off the House floor, Rep. Mark Amodei, a Nevada Republican who announced his opposition to the bill Thursday, said he had felt ”calm” about his plan to vote against the bill. No phone call, leadership pep talk nor Trump   would have convinced him to get to ”yes.”  If his voters disagreed with him at the ballot box in 2018, so be it. ”I don’t know if they will or they won’t. That book is still to be written. But obviously, I’m willing to take that risk,” Amodei said. ”Listen, I’m taking my refuge in the impacts in my district in Nevada.”  Amodei added that he didn’t understand the rush to jam the bill through so quickly.  ”I don’t know that there’s a time limit on it,” he said. ”The same way that some people here want to say it’s got to be done by the anniversary date of signing it. Really? Are we in the Hallmark Card Business? Come on.” Ryan met with his rank and file Friday afternoon. A somber line of members trod into the basement conference room where less than 24 hours before they’d been implored one last time to vote for the bill. They didn’t have the votes, Ryan told them.  The bill would be pulled.  Moderates who’d been on the fence would never have to decide what to do and those moderates who’d come out as a ’yes’ wondered about what would happen to them now. ”I’m really for it,” Rep. Mike Coffman, a Republican from Colorado told CNN. Asked if his public ”yes on a bill that never made it to the floor could hurt him, he was frank. ”I have no idea ultimately,” he said adding he didn’t think it would. ”I have a certain style of politics that seems to work for my district. I have a district that Hillary Clinton won by 9 points and I won by 8. 5.”"
House Republicans pull health care bill,CNN,Stephen Collinson,2017-03-24,"Washington (CNN) Seven years of Republican efforts to eradicate President Barack Obama’s proudest domestic achievement ended Friday before a single vote was cast. House Speaker Paul Ryan sensationally pulled his Obamacare repeal bill from the floor Friday afternoon, a day after President Donald Trump had threatened to walk away from health care reform if he didn’t get a vote. ”We were very close,” Trump said in the Oval Office after the bill was pulled. ”It was a very, very tight margin.” The decision to delay the vote marks an acute embarrassment for the President, who had gambled big by presenting holdout House conservatives with a     it ultimatum Thursday night and put his own credibility on the line. But Trump repeatedly pointed the finger directly at Democrats, who all opposed the measure, rather than at his own party, which holds a significant majority in the House. ”We had no Democratic support,” he said. ”I’ve been saying for the last year and a half that the best thing we could do, politically speaking, is let Obamacare explode. It’s exploding right now.” Trump reiterated the point in a tweet Saturday morning, saying, ”Obamacare will explode and we will all get together and piece together a great health care plan for THE PEOPLE. Do not worry!” The failure of the GOP plan also puts Ryan in a much weakened political position, after being defied by his own conference, which seems just as unsuited to governing in the Trump era as it was when it was effectively a protest coalition under Obama.  RELATED: Paul Ryan accepts it’s over: Obamacare is ’law of the land’ It became clear during a day of intense political intrigue that despite fierce   by Trump, Ryan and other leaders that the votes simply were not there to pass the bill and the leadership and the White House were headed for a lopsided defeat. They were unable to narrow the schism between Freedom Caucus conservatives, who believe the bill keeps too much of Obamacare intact, and moderates who worry they will pay an electoral price if millions of Americans lose health insurance. The House meltdown on Obamacare repeal has perilous implications for the American health care system, with Republicans apparently unable to repeal the law but also unwilling to fix the deficiencies that the White House says will collapse the law. ”We came up short,” Ryan told reporters. ”We are going to be living with Obamacare for the foreseeable future.”  Democrats were gleeful after the failure to even hold a vote. ”In my life, I have never seen an administration as incompetent as the one occupying the White House today,” said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, the New York Democrat who spars often with Trump. ”Today we’ve learned they can’t count votes and they can’t close a deal. So much for the art of the deal.” RELATED: Dems gleeful after Obamacare victory, What happens for Trump and Ryan? Politically, Friday’s momentous events will race like wildfire through the Republican Party’s conservative, establishment base, which has been told repeatedly by candidates that the first order of business with the GOP President in the White House would be to repeal of the Affordable Care Act. Ryan told fellow Republicans they are ”moving on” from health care, Reps. Andy Barr,   and Bill Flores,   told CNN. Trump said tax reform would be next. Trump, the businessman who touted his ability to get things done and promised to transcend Washington politics, said he’s learned from the experience, ”This was an interesting period of time. We all learned a lot,” he said in the Oval Office. ”We learned a lot about loyalty and we learned a lot about the vote getting process. And we learned about very arcane rules in both the Senate and the House. ”Certainly for me it was a very interesting experience, but for me, it’ll be an experience that leads to an even better health care plan,” he added. The White House maintained after the scrapped vote that it is confident in Ryan. ”I like Speaker Ryan. He worked very hard,” Trump said.  White House press secretary Sean Spicer said before the vote Trump has ”left everything on the field when it comes to this bill.” But Republicans had few firm commitments from conservatives and watched a continued exodus of moderates. This was exactly what House leadership was worried would happen when they changed the bill, the source said.  What’s inside the Republican health care bill? But tax reform will be no simpler. Trump acknowledged there are many different groups in the GOP, meaning things aren’t as simple as having one party control both the White House, House and Senate. ”Lots of different groups. Lots of factions and there’s been a long history of liking and disliking within the Republican Party long before I got here,” he said. Freedom Caucus held out, Most prominent of those factions, the Freedom Caucus, held out until the end, saying the bill didn’t go enough to repeal Obamacare. Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows, a North Carolina Republican, said he still wants to work to repeal Obamacare. ”I promised the people of North Carolina’s 11th District that I would fight for a full repeal of the Affordable Care Act and a replacement with a   approach that brings down costs and provides more choices for the American people,” Meadows said in a statement. Vice President Mike Pence met Friday afternoon with members of the Freedom Caucus at the Capitol Hill Club, a source familiar with the meeting said. There are clear signs of frustration in the White House at the Freedom Caucus, which has won a series of concession but is still holding out against the bill. Essential health benefits and why they matter, ”We’ve emboldened them,” one White House aide said. Rep. Leonard Lance,   Jersey, said that without a doubt, the decision to concede the repeal of essential health benefits to the Freedom Caucus definitely moved some of his colleagues to ”no.” ”I suspect some became a no because of that,” Lance said. ”That certainly didn’t help.” What was in the bill, The GOP health care bill would eliminate many of the taxes and eradicate the individual mandate imposed by Obamacare, officially known as the Affordable Care Act. Instead of the Obamacare subsidies that are tied to income and premiums, the GOP plan provides Americans with refundable tax credits based mainly on age to purchase health insurance. The bill also significantly curtails federal support for Medicaid and allows states to require   adults to work. After 2020, states that expanded Medicaid would no longer receive enhanced federal funding to cover   adults like they did under Obamacare, and states that haven’t expanded would be immediately barred from doing so. However, the GOP bill doesn’t touch some of the most popular pieces of Obamacare, including letting children stay on their parents’ insurance plans until the age of 26 and including protections for people with   conditions. But it would end the requirement that insurers offer comprehensive policies that cover maternity, drugs, mental health and substance abuse."
Marine double amputee becomes cop in New York,CNN,,2017-03-24,"New York (CNN) A former US Marine left a double amputee after stepping on an explosive device in Afghanistan has become a police officer in New York. Matias Ferreira, 28, will be one of a few active duty police officers in the entire country that are double amputees. Ferreira, fulfilling a lifelong dream to become a cop, is the first double amputee to join the Suffolk County Police Department in Long Island, New York, according to a Suffolk County Police press release. Ferreira lost both of his legs below the knees after stepping on an improvised explosive device (IED) while serving in Afghanistan in 2011.  More than 40 members of Ferreira’s graduating class are also military veterans. His fellow newly minted officers voted him their class president.  ”On behalf of the entire Suffolk County Police Department, we are honored to have these young men and women joining our ranks tomorrow and dedicating their careers to serving the residents of Suffolk County,” Police Commissioner Timothy D. Sini said in a statement. "
Federal judge sides with Trump administration in travel ban case,CNN,,2017-03-24," (CNN) A federal judge in Virginia ruled in favor of the Trump administration Friday, declining to join other federal courts that halted the President’s revised travel ban last week. Two federal judges    one in Maryland and one in Hawaii    have blocked implementation of the core provisions of the travel ban, and it remains on hold nationwide. Drawing on a litany of   Donald Trump’s statements about Muslims during the presidential campaign, both of the judges concluded that the new executive order likely violates the establishment clause of the Constitution by disfavoring Muslims. RELATED: Federal judge who blocked Trump’s travel ban gets threats, But   US District Judge Anthony Trenga was not persuaded that Trump’s past statements automatically mean the revised executive order is unlawful, especially given the changes it made from the first version. ”This court is no longer faced with a facially discriminatory order coupled with contemporaneous statements suggesting discriminatory intent,” Trenga explained. ”And while the President and his advisers have continued to make statements following the issuance of   (the first executive order) that have characterized or anticipated the nature of   (the revised ban) the court cannot conclude for the purposes of the motion that these statements, together with the President’s past statements, have effectively disqualified him from exercising his lawful presidential authority.” The practical effect of Trenga’s decision is limited at this point because the travel ban is already frozen nationwide, but it adds another judicial voice in support of the legality of the executive order as it makes its way through further proceedings in federal appellate courts.  Trump’s new travel ban blocked: What you need to know, ”The substantive revisions reflected in   have reduced the probative value of the President’s statements to the point that it is no longer likely that plaintiffs can succeed on their claim that the predominate purpose of   is to discriminate against Muslims based on their religion and that   is a pretext or a sham for that purpose,” Trenga added. The Justice Department championed the news. ”As the court correctly explains, the President’s executive order falls well within his authority to safeguard the nation’s security,” said department spokesperson, Sarah Isgur Flores. The lawsuit in Virginia was brought by a cohort of US citizens, permanent residents and foreign nationals who claimed the revised executive order was discriminatory. A timeline of President Trump’s travel bans, ”Thankfully, this decision does not alter the injunctions that are already preventing the implementation of the Trump administration’s illegal executive order. We look forward to the Fourth Circuit and the Supreme Court weighing in on this matter, as those are the bodies that will ultimately decide whether the Constitution will protect the rights of Muslim Americans,” plaintiffs’ attorney Gadeir Abbas said in a statement to CNN. The 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals, which covers appeals from district courts in Virginia, is set to hear the Justice Department’s challenge to the Maryland court’s decision in May."
Khalid Masood: From popular teen to murderous extremist,CNN,Laura Smith-Spark,2017-03-24,"Birmingham, England (CNN) Khalid Masood, the man responsible for the worst terrorist attack in London in more than a decade, kept to himself in recent years, neighbors say. But he had a checkered past involving a series of aliases and a string of convictions for violence and possession of weapons. Police kept his identity quiet at first as they sought to track down his associates and search related properties. But a fuller picture is emerging of the    who drove an SUV onto a sidewalk Wednesday on Westminster Bridge, killing four people and injuring dozens more before being shot dead by a firearms officer just inside the grounds of the Houses of Parliament. The early years, Masood was born on December 25, 1964, in Kent in southeast England. His birth name was Adrian Russell Ajao, although he went on to use multiple aliases. As a boy, Adrian Ajao    as he was then known    was a popular pupil who ”liked to party” and was a keen soccer player, former high school classmate Stuart Knight told Britain’s Press Association news agency. The pair attended Huntleys Secondary School for Boys in the   town of Tunbridge Wells, Kent, for five years, Knight said. They left the school    which has since closed    in 1981. An undated school photo shows Ajao, smiling and with his arms folded, with members of a soccer team. ”He was a very nice guy, down to earth, liked by everyone around him,” Knight told PA. ”There was nothing unassuming about him, he was a very good sportsman, his mother was a Christian, he was an   nice guy.” Criminal convictions, It’s not clear how Masood developed from being a   athletic schoolboy to a man with a string of criminal convictions. His first conviction    for criminal damage    was in November 1983 when he would have been 19, according to police. It was followed by convictions for assaults including causing grievous bodily harm, possession of offensive weapons and public order offenses. His most recent conviction was in December 2003 for possession of a knife, police said. However, he had not been accused of any terrorism offenses. Police first identified him as Khalid Masood but said he had also gone by the name Adrian Elms. A report published in November 2000 in the East Sussex newspaper The Argus said Adrian Elms, then 35, was given a   prison term for slashing the face of a cafe owner in an argument in a pub. According to the report, Elms, from the village of Northiam, near Rye, admitted charges of unlawful wounding and criminal damage at Hove Crown Court. He was one of only two black men living in the village at the time, and there were ”racial overtones” to the row, the court heard. ”His wife and family have now become (ostracized) in the village. It is a very small community and his wife and family have been extremely affected by this,” his attorney, Alexander   told the court. ”He will effectively have to move his family from the village and start to live his life all over again. It will leave the village with a view of black people in the area. The trust that may have been there in the beginning is now completely lost.” Travel to Saudi Arabia, The Saudi Embassy in London confirmed that the London attacker lived in the kingdom between November 2005 and November 2006 as well as April 2008 and April 2009. During that time, Masood was an English teacher, according to a statement published on the   Saudi Press Agency. The embassy statement added that in 2015, he procured an Umra visa    required for pilgrimage to Mecca throughout the year outside of Hajj    and visited the country between March 3 and 8.  ”During his time in Saudi Arabia, Khalid Masood did not appear on the security services’ radar and does not have a criminal record in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,” it said. Birmingham connections, After prison, Masood appears to have moved around over the years    most recently in Birmingham in central England. Police searched two properties where Masood and his family were thought to have lived    the Winson Green and Hagley Road areas of Birmingham. Eight of the 11 arrests made as of Friday afternoon in connection with the investigation were in Birmingham. Police were seen Friday carrying boxes from a modern, redbrick townhouse in a quiet    in Winson Green. Masood is believed to have lived there until December.  Marjoli Gajecka, 26, told CNN she had seen Masood and his family often when she visited her mother, who lives on the same street. Masood was calm and kept to himself, she said, adding: ”He was never really talkative with neighbors.” She said Masood had two children, a boy and a girl, whose ages she estimated to be 6 or 7. She said she was shocked by the news he had carried out the attack in London. ”They just seemed a normal family, a normal Muslim family. We never suspect anything,” she said. Masood wore ”Islamic clothes” most of the time, Gajecka said. A woman she presumed to be Masood’s wife wore a veil with her face uncovered. She also saw the young girl wearing a headscarf. Masood and his family would not have stood out in this multicultural, diverse neighborhood. People are close here, popping in and out of each other’s homes. Some voiced shock over how the atrocity in Westminster had been brought to their doorsteps. About two miles south, on Hagley Road, is the apartment where Masood and his family are thought to have moved at the end of the year. Several arrests were made at the property after police raided it Thursday. Raviyar Sedighi, who owns a shop below the apartment, told CNN he recognized Masood and that ”he was a normal customer, normal man.” He knew him as a ”bodybuilding man,” Sedighi said, going to the gym and buying energy drinks. Sometimes Masood wore a cap, at other times he didn’t wear Islamic dress, he said. Radicalization, The   police inquiry is focused on how Masood became radicalized.  Asked about his possible conversion to Islam and subsequent radicalization, Britain’s top counterterror officer, Mark Rowley, said: ”Clearly that’s the main line of our investigation    is what led him to be radicalized. Was it through influences in a community, influences from overseas or through online propaganda?” Prime Minister Theresa May said the attacker was known to authorities for links to ”violent extremism.” He was investigated ”some years ago” by security services but was regarded as a ”peripheral figure,” May told the House of Commons. He was not part of the ”current intelligence picture,” and authorities did not know he was about to mount an assault. A UK official told CNN that Masood’s age was not typical for an ideologically driven attacker: ”  is interesting. Not the usual young pup profile.” The   Amaq news agency asserted the attack was carried out by one of its ”soldiers.” But that does not necessarily mean the group had any direct connections to Masood, whom it did not name."
Ukraine seeks clues in Kremlin critic’s death,CNN,,2017-03-24,"Kiev, Ukraine (CNN) Ukrainian authorities searched for leads Friday in the killing of a Kremlin critic, shot dead the day before outside a hotel in broad daylight, an act Ukraine’s President labeled a ”Russian state terrorist act.” Denis Voronenkov, a onetime Communist member of Russia’s lower house of parliament, died Thursday after being shot outside a hotel in Kiev, the capital. Voronenkov, who fled to Ukraine last year, is the latest in a string of Russian critics of President Vladimir Putin and the Russian government who were killed or injured in mysterious circumstances. Authorities want to question a driver who dropped off Voronenkov’s killer, said Larisa Sargan, a spokeswoman for Ukraine’s general prosecutor. But she told CNN it is unclear whether the driver had any involvement in the fatal assault. The attacker was wounded after a shootout with Voronenkov’s bodyguard. The assailant was taken to a hospital, where he later died, Kiev police Chief Andriy Krischenko said. The shooting apparently was captured on security camera footage released by RBK Ukraine, a media company, and circulated on social media. In the video, two men walking down the street    one in a   coat and the other in a   coat    are followed by a third man in a hoodie who comes close to them and raises his arm, as if to fire a weapon.  The man in the   jacket falls to the ground. The shooter stands over the body and appears to fire a weapon again, then runs. The man in the   coat, who’d also fallen to the ground, fires his weapon after the fleeing shooter. The video matches the description authorities have given of the shooting. The suspect’s identity and who injured him weren’t available.  No motive for the attack was immediately known. CNN video shows investigators standing over the bloodied body of Voronenkov, lying   on a Kiev sidewalk near the Premier Palace hotel.  Russia slams Ukraine accusations, Calling the killing a ”Russian state terrorist act” on Twitter, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko described Voronenkov as ”one of the key witnesses of the Russian aggression against Ukraine,” referring to Russia’s 2014 annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea region and a subsequent war with   rebels. Poroshenko’s accusation drew a sharp rebuke from officials in Russia.  Any claims that Russia is connected to the killing are ”absurd,” Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Thursday, according to the Russian   news agency TASS. The speaker of Russia’s Duma, the lower house of parliament, rejected the Ukraine leader’s allegation, calling it premature. ”Such statements can only be made on the basis of the investigation,” Vyacheslav Volodin said Friday, according to TASS.  ”There was no probe yet, and it is unlikely to be impartial considering the current situation in Ukraine,” Volodin said.   ”That’s why all statements made instantly are an attempt, on the one hand, to shuffle off the blame on to someone else. On the other hand, everything suggests that all that may have been orchestrated.” Ukraine, Volodin said, ”is increasingly turning into a terrorist state where laws do not work.” Cooperation in court case, Voronenkov had denounced Russia’s annexation of Crimea and said he was cooperating with Ukrainian prosecutors’ treason case against former President Viktor Yanukovych, the   politician who fled Ukraine in 2014 after protests. Ukrainian Prosecutor General Yuriy Lutsenko said Voronenkov had given ”extremely important testimony” to military prosecutors. His killing was ”a demonstrative execution of a witness,” Lutsenko said.  Annexation of Crimea called a ’mistake’ Voronenkov and his wife, Maria Maksakova, also a former Russian lawmaker, sharply criticized Putin after they left Russia for Ukraine in October.  In a February interview with Radio Free Europe, Voronenkov called Russia’s seizure of Crimea a ”mistake” and ”illegal” and said the couple left the country because of pressure from security services. Voronenkov also alleged that although he was recorded as having voted for the annexation in the Duma, the vote was cast against his will. He was not there that day, and another legislator used Voronenkov’s card to vote for him, he told Radio Free Europe. The day after that interview, Peskov, Putin’s spokesman, denied Voronenkov’s allegation. ”I was present at almost every voting and it wasn’t like they (Voronenkov and Maksakova) said,” Peskov said, according to Russia’s   Sputnik news service. Voronenkov said he thought his criticisms led Russian authorities to charge him in absentia with fraud in February, Radio Free Europe reported. He called the charges ”fake” and ”political,” the report said. Sputnik cast Voronenkov’s departure from Russia as an attempt to flee from investigation. Voronenkov said he’d become a Ukrainian citizen. While he was a Communist Party member, his wife had belonged to the ruling United Russia party. Witness against Yanukovych, Voronenkov also told Radio Free Europe he was helping Ukrainian prosecutors prepare their case against Yanukovych, who is accused of treason, in part for allegedly facilitating the Crimea annexation after fleeing Ukraine. As Ukraine’s President, Yanukovych suspended talks in 2013 on what was to be a landmark political and trade deal with the European Union. Russia had opposed Ukraine forming closer ties with the EU. Tens of thousands of   protesters rallied in Kiev against Yanukovych’s decision, and in February 2014, a gunfight between protesters and police left dozens dead. Yanukovych soon fled, eventually for Russia. Russia’s parliament signed off on Putin’s request to send military forces into Crimea the next month. An uprising by   rebels in the eastern Ukrainian regions of Donetsk and Luhansk ensued, a conflict that has left thousands dead. ”I told (prosecutors) some details of what was going on. And I will give testimony in open court in the course of judicial inquiry held in Ukraine,”  Voronenkov told Radio Free Europe. Other deaths, injuries of Kremlin critics, Voronenkov is one of several Kremlin critics to die or be injured in mysterious circumstances. The Kremlin has staunchly denied accusations that it or its agents are targeting political opponents or had anything to do with the deaths. Putin critic Boris Nemtsov, a deputy prime minister in the late 1990s under President Boris Yeltsin, was one of those Kremlin critics. He was shot in the back while walking in central Moscow two years ago.  Last month, Nemtsov’s friend, Vladimir   spent several days in a coma after a suspected poisoning.   is part of Open Russia, an organization of   activists who are calling for open elections, a free press and civil rights reforms. It was the second time in two years   fell into a coma after a suspected poisoning. He was released from the hospital February 19 and is undergoing rehabilitation abroad, Radio Free Europe reported. In 2006, former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko died a slow death from poisoning in Britain. In a deathbed statement, he blamed Putin for ordering his poisoning by means of the rare radioactive substance   saying it was slipped into his tea at a London hotel. In that same year, Anna Politkovskaya, a journalist critical of Russia’s war in Chechnya, was gunned down at the entrance to her Moscow apartment. The deaths have raised questions about the vulnerability of the government’s critics.  But that isn’t stopping Aleksey Navalny, a prominent opposition figure, from calling for mass   protests Sunday in Russia, according to social media announcements."
"Budget director: If you want maternity care under GOP plan, change your state laws",CNN,Eugene Scott,2017-03-24," (CNN) President Donald Trump’s budget director said Friday that Republicans’ health care bill would shift decisions such as whether to cover maternity care to states    and if voters don’t like them, they should change their state laws. ”States not only have the ability to require those services    many of them already do,” Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney said on CBS’s ”This Morning.” ”What we’re doing is taking away the federal controls of the system.” A common criticism of Obamacare is that the federal law mandates 10 ”essential health benefits,” including maternity and newborn care, mental health services and prescription drugs, be covered, often resulting in requiring recipients to pay for coverage they don’t need. ”If you live in a state that wants to mandate maternity coverage for everybody, including    women, that’s fine,” added Mulvaney, a former congressman from South Carolina. ”But what if you live in a state that doesn’t do that?” asked CBS’s Alex Wagner. ”Then you can figure out a way to change the state that you live in,” Mulvaney replied. ”So you should move?” ”They could try to change their own state legislatures and state laws,” Mulvaney said. ”Why do we look to the federal government to fix our local problems? That’s one of the big problems of Obamacare.” ”They took that one size fits all and crammed it down on the entire country,” Mulvaney added. House GOP leaders have agreed to change the Obamacare provision that guarantees all health insurers cover services such as maternity, mental health and prescription drugs in hopes of wooing conservative lawmakers to their side. The 10 ”essential health benefits” requirement has made coverage more comprehensive and prevented insurers from selling skimpy plans that were cheap. But these policies didn’t offer many benefits    often leaving consumers with big bills if they needed care."
Chloe and Halle talk women’s rights and Beyoncé,CNN,Deena Zaru,2017-03-24,"Austin, Texas (CNN) CNN caught up with RB duo Chloe x Halle at the SXSW music festival in Austin, Texas, where the Atlanta natives opened up about their passion for women’s rights, the power of music and their relationship with their mentor, Beyoncé. Describing music as a ”universal language,” Chloe Bailey, 18, said that regardless of the color of a person’s skin or their gender, ”everyone understands feelings and emotion.”  ”Everybody has their different opinions, but once you hear a song, you can agree on something,” Halle, 16, said before the sisters’ performance at the YouTube House @ Coppertank at the festival Friday.  SXSW gets political: Artists unleash on Trump, The singers and songwriters dropped their latest mix tape, ”The Two of Us,” last week and their latest EP, ”Sugar Symphony,” in April 2016. The RB stars participated in the women’s march in Los Angeles in January the day following President Donald Trump’s inauguration, joining hundreds of thousands of women around the world who marched to protest the new administration’s policies and speak out on women’s rights. ”WHAT AN INCREDIBLE DAY WITH INCREDIBLE ENERGY. WOMEN RULE THIS PLANET. DON’T LET ANYONE TELL YOU DIFFERENT,” they tweeted on January 21. ”Our bodies. our choice. super proud of the effort so many women are making today by marching. let’s get in formation ladies,” they added. Chloe said that in the current political climate, she noticed that more young people are speaking out and becoming politically active. ”I think that also comes with the age of social media and Internet. People are raising their voices through their really cool channels or their pages to really share what they believe in,” Chloe said. ”I believe it’s more than just doing a hashtag. You should go out there and do the women’s march and the march for equality.” Chloe x Halle performed the anthem ”This is For My Girls” at the White House’s annual Easter Egg Roll last April and were introduced by   lady Michelle Obama, who spoke about her ”Let Girls Learn” initiative, which advocates for women’s education.  ”We want to inspire young girls to keep going in whatever they want to do and to challenge themselves and to not be afraid of certain jobs . .. just because maybe something might have lots of males doing it,” Halle said. Chloe x Halle rose to the national spotlight in 2013 when their soulful cover of Beyoncé’s ”Pretty Hurts” went viral, and in 2015, Beyoncé signed the sisters to her label, Parkwood Entertainment. In July, they opened for Beyoncé on the European leg of her ”Formation World Tour,” and their most popular songs include their single ”Drop,” ”Fall” and ”Red Lights.” ”That was a really awesome learning experience for us because every single night we would watch her on stage and she would give it 1, 000%,” Chloe said, adding that Beyoncé is also ”a phenomenal businesswoman and she makes us want to be educated in that avenue as well.” Describing what it’s like to have ”Queen Bey” as their mentor, Halle said she and her sister benefited from the superstar’s own wisdom gleaned from growing up in the music industry. ”It really is so beautiful because you look to her and you see confidence, you see this radiance, you see this light and you look at her and say ’that’s what I aspire to be,’” Halle said.  ”We are blessed to be able to talk to her and hear her wisdom and hear everything that she’s gone through, because what we’re now going through, she’s been through already,” she added."
Team of blind students battling in robotics competition,CNN,Doug Criss,2017-03-24," (CNN) What do you do when you’re a student and you want to compete in robotics competitions    and you’re blind? Well, you go to the dark side, of course. Dark Side is the name of a robotics team in Iowa made up mostly of blind students. It’s taking part in a regional competition this weekend in Cedar Falls against dozens of other teams from the US, China and Brazil. One of the team members said he asked teachers if they could form a team because they had something to prove. ”We can do it and we can pass it down to other   students. That’s our goal,” Danny Grimes told CNN affiliate KCRG.  Building with Braille, There’s eight students on the team: three blind students, three with only very limited vision and two students who can see. The Dark Side operates just like any other robotics team with just one exception. The components they use to build the robots have Braille labels. (The touch reading system for the blind appears in the team’s slogan too: ”May the Braille be with you. ”) The two team members who can see handle the steering of the robots during competitions. Sara Larkin, a teacher at the Iowa Braille and Sightsaving School, said what the team is doing is pretty awesome. ”They’ve already got so much out of it. It’s just amazing,” Larking said. ”Most of them had never used a power tool, a screw driver or a hammer before.”"
AARP to Trump voters: This isn’t the change you expected,CNN,Theodore Schleifer,2017-03-24,"Washington (CNN) AARP is pitching a message directly to seniors who supported Donald Trump for president as the debate over the Republican health care bill enters the home stretch. The advocacy organization is running a radio ad challenging Trump’s identity as a change agent and arguing that the bill to be decided in the House of Representatives on Friday serves as an ”age tax” on the elderly. ”You walked into the voting booth. You thought it through. You cast your ballot. But the new health care bill in Congress is not the change you voted for. In fact, it’s loaded with everything you voted against,” the spot says. ”That’s not the change you had in mind when you cast your ballot. And that’s why you should call you member of Congress today.” The AARP is one of many outside groups looking to pressure lawmakers ahead of a tough vote to repeal and replace Obamacare, but is one of the few running ads directly speaking to Trump voters and asking them to vote against his interests. The organization says it is a   buy that began airing in targeted congressional districts this week. Also on Friday, one   political group that was expected to be a major player in the debate, America First Policies, unveiled its first ad intended to boost Trump’s argument against Obamacare.  ”President Trump is keeping his promise. Now we need Congress to keep theirs,” the narrator says. But the   spot is almost certainly belated the vote in the House appears to be only hours away."
"US, Israel move closer to agreement to curb settlements",CNN,Elise Labott,2017-03-24,"Washington (CNN) The United States is moving closer to agreement with Israel to limit settlement construction that could pave the way for an eventual resumption of the   peace process, US, Israeli and Arab officials told CNN.  A White House statement issued Thursday night at the conclusion of four days of talks between Israeli and US officials in Washington indicated that the US expects that Israel will be curbing construction of housing in West Bank areas claimed by Palestinians for a future state. The American delegation ”reiterated President (Donald) Trump’s concerns regarding settlement activity in the context of moving towards a peace agreement,” the statement said. ”The Israeli delegation made clear that Israel’s intent going forward is to adopt a policy regarding settlement activity that takes those concerns into consideration.” US and Israeli officials said that Jason Greenblatt, Trump’s special representative on peace negotiations, made clear during the talks, which built on another round of meetings in the Middle East earlier in the month, that the President wants Israel to slow settlement construction and doesn’t want such activity to jeopardize efforts to restart the peace process. The Trump administration has told Israel to build within the boundaries of existing settlements and not to establish new communities, according to the sources. Soon after Trump took office, Netanyahu announced that Israel would establish the first new settlement in some two decades. Greenblatt also told the Israelis that Trump wants to see Netanyahu demonstrate he is willing to take steps to slow construction and take other   measures, according to the officials.   But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been reluctant to stop settlement building, and his leadership is facing a challenge from the right wing that is pushing for increased building and even annexation of parts of the West Bank. It is unclear that he will deliver what the US is hoping for on the politically explosive issue. ”We have a clearer understanding of where and how the White House wants to see us build,” a senior Israeli official said after the two rounds of talks.  The   agreement under discussion is expected to be announced with a set of economic and development projects in the Palestinian territories with an emphasis on Gaza, the officials said. Thursday night’s White House statement said the talks explored ”concrete,   measures to improve the overall climate in order to advance the prospects for a genuine and lasting peace between Israel and the Palestinians,” focusing on ”specific measures that could have a meaningful impact on the economic environment in the West Bank and Gaza.” ”The talks were serious and constructive, and they are ongoing,” the statement said. Diplomatic sources said the agreement and economic measures are meant to lay the groundwork for an eventual resumption of the peace process. US, Israeli and Arab officials said the flurry of diplomatic activity is working toward a   meeting between Netanyahu, Arab Leaders and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in the coming months. No date has been scheduled for the summit, and the sources said Trump’s advisers have stressed the importance of laying the groundwork before holding such a meeting. ”The key will be ensuring that this meeting is more than a ” one Arab official said. ”It’s important to prepare a resumption of the peace process so that there is a   outcome.” The Israeli delegation to Washington was led by Yoav Horowitz, Netyanyahu’s chief of staff, and included Israeli lawyers who specialize in legal issues related to the settlements. Greenblatt led the US delegation of National Security Council and State Department officials in both Washington and overseas. In addition to two meetings with Netanyahu, Greenblatt met with Abbas, Palestinian civil society groups and visited with Palestinian children in a West Bank Refugee camp. He also traveled to Amman to meet with Jordan’s King Abdullah. Following a meeting with Netanyahu last month, Trump urged Netanyahu to curb new housing construction while he pursued a peace deal, a position past presidents have adopted. ”I’d like to see you hold back on settlements for a little bit,” he told the Israeli premier at a press conference. A parade of Arab leaders is expected to visit Washington for meetings with Trump and other top officials over the next several weeks, starting with Egyptian President Fattah   on April 3 and culminating with a visit to the White House by Abbas later next month. Trump invited Abbas to the White House during their first phone call two weeks ago. Abbas’s office said that he told Greenblatt during their meeting that he believed a ”historic peace deal is possible” under Trump’s leadership. In addition to Greenblatt’s meetings, Trump’s    and senior adviser Jared Kushner has also been meeting with Israeli and Arab leaders in recent months to better understand the climate in the region. Trump has said he wants Kushner to lead the peace process. During his news conference with Netanyahu, Trump abandoned two decades of US foreign policy by declaring the US would not insist on a     solution leading to the creation of a Palestinian state as part of a peace deal between Israelis and Palestinians. ”I’m looking at   and  ” formulations, Trump said alongside Netanyahu. ”I am very happy with the one that both parties like. I can live with either one.”"
Carrier Layoffs Teach Workers Costs of Global Trade - Breitbart,Breitbart,Mary Chastain,2016-03-19,"Those who work for Carrier have learned the costs of global trade on a personal and financial level after the company suddenly announced a move to Mexico. [“We have to look around the corner and see how this market will change in order to invest and stay in business for another 100 years,” explained Robert McDonough, a senior executive at Carrier’s parent company, United Technologies. “You can blink and see your market position erode. ”  However, the loss is only part of a long line of lost manufacturing jobs in America. The New York Times states that “advances in technology, the diffusion of industrial expertise around the world, the availability of cheap labor and the rise of China as a manufacturing powerhouse would have disrupted the nation’s industrial heartland even without new trade deals,” listing these as the main reasons why companies like Carrier leave the country. Carrier chose to move, even though the Department of Energy claimed the company earned $5. 1 million from President Barack Obama’s stimulus program. Local media reported the “Department of Energy awarded Carrier $5. 1 million in clean energy tax credits in December 2013” for its Indianapolis facility. It planned to use the money to “expand production at its Indianapolis facility to meet increasing demand for its   condensing gas furnace product line. ” Carrier denied it received any money. The Carrier workers have also discovered that other jobs in Indianapolis do not pay as well. The new Amazon plant only pays $15 an hour instead of the usual $20 at Carrier. Carol Bigbee, 59, earned $22 an hour. “I think it will be extremely hard to find a job that pays $22 an hour,” she said. “You have to be really blessed to find a job that pays that kind of money. ” Carrier insists the move “is strictly a business decision. ” It decided last month to move 1, 400 jobs from Indianapolis to Mexico, starting in 2017. “Today’s surprise announcement was without warning and incredibly disappointing,” said Mayor Joe Hogsett, adding: While I am obviously concerned about the economic impact, my top priority is the   of the hardworking families affected by this decision. A job lost in any part of our community affects us all, and I believe these are the times we must come together as one city to lift up our neighbors. The move even united Democrats and Republicans. “As governor, I was profoundly disappointed to learn that Carrier Corporation and United Technologies would relocate jobs and operations to Mexico, costing   Hoosiers more than 2, 100 jobs,” stated Governor Mike Pence. “My heart goes out to all the families and communities that are affected by this news. ” Democratic Indianapolis council member Zach Adamson told the media the company he uses to heat his house “does not want   Carrier products. ” Adamson also insisted Indianapolis must “claw back the incentives and benefits they have received to be here. ”"
Vox: ’Media Obsession with a Bulls**t Email Scandal’ Helped Donald Trump Win - Breitbart,Breitbart,Breitbart News,2016-11-09,"Matt Yglesias of Vox works out his feelings Wednesday morning after the American public voted to hold Hillary Clinton accountable for exposing the nation’s secrets to amateur hackers  —   rebuking the FBI’s contorted rationale not to prosecute her lawbreaking. [From Vox:  The media’s coverage of the 2016 race didn’t win the election for Donald Trump, but it didn’t help. Back in September, Gallup presented the findings of an important research project that, in retrospect, ought to have prompted a lot more soul searching among members of the press. What they did was, over an extended period of time, survey people and ask them what they were hearing about the two candidates. The answer is that with regard to Hillary Clinton, they heard a lot about email. With regard to Trump, they heard about nothing in particular. Read the rest of the tantrum here."

Lynch, who declined to say if it’s illegal for cabinet members to do all their business on a private server, was asked [relevant exchange begins around 10:40] if she would have a private server. She answered, “Well, we use our DOJ servers here, for emails. ” When asked, “So, you wouldn’t have a private server at home?” Lynch stated, “I don’t comment on that. ” Anchor Bret Baier then asked, “Well, You wouldn’t.

She stated, after talking about working with law enforcement through her career “[O]ne of the best things we do is work together, with our law enforcement partners, in reviewing evidence, and coming to a conclusion, as to what’s there and what’s not there. ” She added, “[W]e’ll see what evidence develops, and what facts develop, and we’ll follow those to their natural conclusion. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett"
Conway: Clinton Campaign ‘Gaming the Refs’ Ahead of Debate - Breitbart,Breitbart,Pam Key,2016-09-26,"Monday on NBC’s “Today,” GOP nominee Donald Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway criticized the Clinton campaign staffers for “gaming the refs” by going on media for the last week and repeatedly saying, “It’s your job to make sure that Donald Trump is   in  . ”  Conway said, “Robby and I are living in parallel universes. I mean, Donald Trump has been criticized all weekend long. I think that the Clinton campaign has clearly been gaming the refs, has been talking to the media for a week now saying, ‘It’s your job to make sure that Donald Trump is   in  .’ I’m just surprised the campaign manager would try to lower expectations that dramatically for his own candidate. But look, they know that campaign debates are not Hillary Clinton’s sweet spot. Yes, she is experienced at doing them but the experience hasn’t necessarily been beneficial.

CNN quotes Kalamazoo County Undersheriff Paul Matyas, saying, “What it looks like is we have someone just driving around, finding people and shooting them dead in their tracks. ” According to the Mirror, Kalamazoo County prosecutor Jeffrey Getting said the randomness of Dalton’s alleged actions are “just the most awful thing [anyone] can think of. ” AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.

Rolling Stone’s Disgraced UVA Reporter Faces Scrutiny on Catholic Child Rape Story - Breitbart,Breitbart,Austin Ruse,2016-01-21,"A Philadelphia priest died in prison after being convicted of repeatedly raping a    boy. A new report from   psychiatrist concludes the accuser, now a young man with a $5 million settlement in his pocket, may be a pathological liar and his whole testimony has been thrown into serious doubt. [Daniel Gallagher made national news in 2011 when he charged two Catholic priests and one teacher with serial rape when he was a fifth and sixth grader at St. Jerome’s parish in Philadelphia. His testimony put four people in jail, including two Catholic priests  —   Charles Engelhardt and Edward Avery  —   and one Catholic school teacher, Bernard Shero.  His testimony also led to the conviction of Monsignor William Lynn, then Secretary for Clergy at the Archdiocese of Philadelphia, for endangering the welfare of a child. Lynn became the first Catholic administrator jailed for failing to protect a child. Gallagher, then identified as “Billy Doe” and described as “a sweet gentle kid with boyish good looks,” charged that on January 30, 2009 a priest assaulted him after Gallagher served as altar boy at a 6:15 a. m. Mass. He said the priest got him drunk on sacramental wine and then anally raped him for five hours. After it was over, Gallagher said the priest told him, “If you ever tell anyone, I will kill you. ” In another attack he charged that the priest “punched him in the back of the head, and he fell down. ” When he woke up “he as completely naked, and his hands were tied with altar boy sashes. ” The priest then anally raped him, and supposedly “made him suck all the blood off of his penis. ” Other lurid details followed. Gallagher’s brutal tales even caught the attention of now disgraced Rolling Stone reporter Sabrina Rubin Erdely who included the “Billy Doe” story in a mammoth 2011 story called “The Catholic Church’s Secret   Files. ” Erdely is the one who reported the story, now retracted and under multiple law suits, about the gang rape hoax at a University of Virginia fraternity house. Erdely reported that the boy was “passed around” from priest to priest who “raped and sodomized the    sometimes making him perform stripteases or getting him drunk on sacramental wine after Mass. ” It turns out that all of Gallagher’s charges very well might be lies told by a sociopath. Besides the multiple criminal convictions that led to the jailing of the priests, the teacher and the administrator, Gallagher filed a civil suit against the Archdiocese of Philadelphia and the individuals convicted of the alleged crimes. Newsweek reports that the Archdiocese settled late last summer for $5 million. The individual civil suits were still in play, however, and the court ordered a forensic psychiatric evaluation of Gallagher which was obtained by Newsweek reporter Ralph Cipriano who concludes, “Judging from [the report] Billy Doe has as much credibility as Jackie [the now disgraced UVA accuser]. ” Cipriano reports that Dr. Stephen Mechanick gave Gallagher the “Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory test known as the  . ” In his report about Gallagher, Mechanick writes, The client is apparently immature and   manipulating others to his own ends  …    . He refuses to accept responsibility for his problems. He may have an exaggerated or grandiose idea of his own capabilities and personal worth. He is likely to be hedonistic and may overuse alcohol or drugs. He appears to be quite impulsive, and he may act out against others without considering the consequences  …    . Paranoid features and externalization of blame are likely to be present  …    . His manipulative and   behavior may cause great difficulties for people close to him  …    . An individual with this profile is usually viewed as having a Personality Disorder, probably a Paranoid or   Personality. Symptoms of a delusional disorder are prominent in his clinical pattern. The psychiatrist concludes Gallagher lied about a great deal including his drug abuse, psychiatric history, and “his personal and medical background. ” He lied about being a paramedic and a professional surfer. Even more damning, the psychiatrist concluded Gallagher provided “conflicting and unreliable information” on the sexual abuse that sent two priest to prison, one to die there. “It is not possible to conclude to a reasonable degree of psychiatric certainty that Mr. Gallagher was sexually abused as a child,” he writes. Newsweek reports that the psychiatrist is not the only person who has questioned the veracity of Gallagher. The lead detective at the time has “disturbing doubts” because during the investigation Gallagher was nonresponsive, “claimed he was high on drugs” or “told a different story. ” Gallagher’s stories kept changing. Where he first reported the   rape after the morning Mass, he later testified “he and priest had engaged in mutual masturbation and oral sex. ” What’s more, it is now doubtful that Gallagher had ever served at the 6:15 a. m. Mass. His mother kept meticulous notes about his schedule and that Mass never appears in her notes. It is also doubtful his helicopter mother would have allowed her small child to walk nearly a mile in the cold and dark to serve at Mass and then afterward sit outside his school until it opened more than an hour later. Where he first said he had been punched in the head and woke up naked and tied with sashes, in later testimony “he dropped the punch in the head, as well as the claims about being tied up with altar sashes, smacked in the face and forced to suck blood. ” Besides being accused of being “an habitual liar,” Gallagher is a multiple drug abuser who has been in and out of jail. He now lives in Florida with a new wife and a $5 million bank account, thanks to the Catholics of Philadelphia. Father Engelhardt died in prison strapped to a gurney and not allowed medical attention.   priest Avery is still in prison, as is the teacher Shero. Monsignor Lynn is still there, too, though judges and prosecutors have fought for his release. Once the damning forensic psychiatric report on Gallagher was released and on the eve of jury selection, Gallagher’s lawyers dropped the civil charges against the surviving accused.

San Francisco Teachers’ Union Provides Anti-Trump Curriculum,Breitbart,Joel B. Pollak,2016-11-17,"The United Educators of San Francisco, the union that represents teachers in the city’s public schools, released a controversial guide Wednesday to teaching public school children about Donald Trump’s victory over Hillary Clinton in the recent election. [The guide, called the “Lesson Plan on the November 2016 Election,” informs teachers that “a racist and sexist man has become the president of our country by pandering to a huge racist and sexist base,” and suggests they teach children the same.  In fact, the lesson plan urges teachers not to tell students that Hillary Clinton lost the election (original emphasis): “DO NOT: Tell them that we have LOST and that we have to accept this. We do not have to accept ANYTHING except that we must and will fight for justice against an unjust system and against unjust people. ” The guide also recommends that teachers allow students to use profanity when expressing their feelings about the election, because “you would too if you have suffered under the constructs of white supremacy or experienced sexism, or any isms or lack of privilege. ” The Associated Press reports that the union “posted the plan on its website and distributed it via an email newsletter to its more than 6, 000 members. The school district has more than 57, 000 students. ” The school district refused to condemn the plan, saying that it was optional. The Republican Party of San Francisco condemned the lesson plan, as the AP notes: “It’s inappropriate on every level,” said Harmeet Dhillon, an RNC committeewoman from California. She called it “inappropriate propaganda that unfairly demonizes not only the campaign that Donald Trump, the winner, ran, but also all of the people who voted for him. ” Joel B.

50th Anniversary of Kwanzaa Kicks off Monday in L.A. - Breitbart,Breitbart,Joel B. Pollak,2016-12-26,"The holiday of Kwanzaa begins on Monday with a celebration in Los Angeles that will also mark the 50th anniversary of the holiday’s first observance, in 1966. [The “official Kwanzaa website” describes the holiday and its meaning:  Kwanzaa is an African American and   holiday which celebrates family, community and culture. It was created in 1966 by Dr. Maulana Karenga, a professor of Africana Studies. Kwanzaa, a   cultural festival, begins December 26 and ends January 1. It joins communitarian values and practices of Continental African and African American culture. During the holiday, families and communities organize activities around the Nguzo Saba (The Seven Principles): Umoja (Unity) Kujichagulia ( ) Ujima (Collective Work and Responsibility) Ujamaa (Cooperative Economics) Nia (Purpose) Kuumba (Creativity) and Imani (Faith). Participants also celebrate with feasts (karamu) music, dance, poetry, narratives and end the holiday with a day dedicated to reflection and recommitment to The Seven Principles and other central cultural values. The holiday also involves lighting candles on   candelabras called kinaras. In the recent past, Kwanzaa has become an object of political controversy. In 2012, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi ( ) accused Republicans of allowing the “fiscal cliff” negotiations over tax cutes that were due to expire to drag on into the final hours of the year due to their lack of respect for Kwanzaa and other holidays. In 2013, President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama sent Kwanzaa greetings, as did the Republican National Committee. Breitbart News’ Jerome Hudson argued at the time, however, that “the entire holiday is a fake and was invented out of thin air by a radical   named Ron Karenga. ” The Kwanzaa kickoff is at 6:30 p. m. Monday at the African American Cultural Center, 3018 W. 48th Street, Los Angeles CA 90043. Attendees are encouraged by organizers to “bring clean warm clothes and blankets for the needy. ” The holiday runs through January 1. Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News.

Donald Trump: ’We Need a National Anti-Crime Agenda’ - Breitbart,Breitbart,Alex Swoyer,2016-09-22,"After violent riots in Charlotte, North Carolina, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is addressing crime and violence. [“This is a national crisis,” Trump said during a speech in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on Thursday. He said it is the job of the president to address the crisis and save African American lives.  Trump touted former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani’s policies that he says brought down the crime rate by 76 percent and murder rate in New York City by more than 80 percent. “We need a national   agenda to make our cities safe again,” Trump stressed. “Safety is the foundation of the ladder to American success. ” He also praised law enforcement, saying they need support. “They are the line separating civilians and civilization from total chaos. ”"
Illegal Family Crossings at Mexican Border Up 95% from Last Year,Breitbart,Bob Price,2016-10-18,"A report from Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson reveals the number of illegal border crossing apprehensions of Family Units from Central America and Mexico hit the highest level on record. [Family Unit apprehensions set an   high with 77, 674 crossings in FY 2016.  Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC) hit the second highest mark. The 59, 692 UACs were second to the 2014 historic mark of 69, 970. “I urge the next administration and the next Congress to continue to make smart investments in border security technology, equipment and other resources,” Secretary Johnson wrote in a statement obtained by Breitbart Texas. “The reality is the system is broken, and badly in need of comprehensive immigration reform that only Congress can provide. ” Family Unit apprehensions reported a 95 percent increase in FY 2016 over FY 2015. Those increases were in all Border Patrol sectors with the El Paso Sector leading the way. El Paso reported an increase of 364 percent while Yuma showed an increase of 256 percent. The Rio Grande Valley had the largest number of Family Unit apprehensions with 52, 006, a 90 percent increase over FY 2015. The Family Unit apprehensions came mostly from El Salvador (27, 114) Guatemala (23, 067) Honduras (20, 226) and Mexico (3, 481). Of the 59, 629 apprehension of UACs all along the border, 47, 192 entered through Texas (79 percent) the report states. The El Paso Sector led Texas increases in crossings by a rate of 134 percent. A total of 3, 885 UACs crossed in that sector during FY 2016, compared to 1, 662 in FY 2015, and 1, 029 in FY 2014.  The Yuma Sector saw the second largest increase in UAC’s, also at 200 percent. Their numbers increased to 3, 266 in FY 2016 from 1, 090 in FY 2015 and 351 in FY 2014. A possible explanation for this is drug cartels learned the value of tying up Border Patrol agents with the   task of processing UACs to distract them from their lucrative drug and human smuggling operations. Guatemalan children led the numbers of UACs apprehended at the border with 18, 913. El Salvador was second in sending its children to the United States at the hands of drug cartel smugglers with 17, 512. Mexico and Honduras trailed with 11, 926 and 10, 468 respectively. The El Paso Sector also saw a very large increase of 134 percent. 3, 885 UACs crossed in FY 2106 compared to 1, 662 in FY 2015 and 1, 029 in FY 2014. The Rio Grande Valley Sector in South Texas remained solidly in first place with 36, 714 unaccompanied children crossing in FY 2016. “Unaccompanied children and families have presented new challenges in our immigration system,” Johnson stated. “I have traveled to the southwest border 17 times over the last 34 months as Secretary and have seen this personally. We are determined to treat migrants in a humane manner. At the same time, we must enforce our immigration laws consistent with our enforcement priorities. ” In June 2014, Breitbart Texas shocked the world with leaked photos showing massive numbers of UACs being warehoused in inhumane conditions and facilities that were clearly not designed to hold the numbers being detained. The report changed the national discussion of illegal immigration at the time and forced worldwide media attention on the crisis. Public interest has since waned while the numbers of Unaccompanied Alien Children and Family Units continue to flood into the country at alarming levels.

Weiner is separated from wife Huma Abedin, one of Clinton’s closest aides. And they worried that Clinton’s unconventional email arrangement had finally caught up to her and might imperil her presidential bid less than two weeks before Election Day. “I’m livid, actually,” one Clinton surrogate told The Hill. “This has turned into malpractice. It’s an unforced error at this point. I have no idea what Comey is up to but the idea this email issue is popping back up again is outrageous. It never should have occurred in the first place.

Ann Coulter: Trump’s Problem with Women - Breitbart,Breitbart,Ann Coulter,2016-05-18,"The New York Times’   article last Saturday on Donald J. Trump’s dealings with women forced me into a weekend of  . As much as I support Trump, this isn’t a cult of personality. He’s not Mao, Kim   or L. Ron Hubbard. We can like our candidates, but still acknowledge their flaws. No one’s perfect. [I admit there are some things about Trump that give me pause. I’m sure these will come out eventually, so I’m just going to list them.  First  —   and this is corroborated by five contemporaneous witnesses  —   in 1978, Trump violently raped Juanita Broaddrick in a Little Rock, Arkansas, hotel room, then, as he was leaving, looked at her bloody lip and said, “Better put some ice on that”  —   oh wait, I’m terribly sorry. Did I say Trump? I didn’t mean Trump, I meant Bill Clinton. Hang on  —   here we go! Knowing full well about Bill Clinton’s proclivity to sexually assault women, about three weeks after that rape, Trump cornered Broaddrick at a party and said, pointedly, “I just want you to know how much Bill and I appreciate the things you do for him. Do you understand? Everything you do. ” No! My mistake! That wasn’t Trump either. That was Hillary Clinton  …     But this next one I’m sure was Trump. In the early 1990s, Trump invited a young female staffer to his hotel room at the Excelsior Hotel in Little Rock, dropped his pants and said, “Kiss it”  —   WAIT A SECOND! I don’t know how this keeps happening. That was Bill Clinton. Please bear with me  —   it’s late at night and my notes are jumbled. As CEO of an organization, Trump had a female employee, just months out of her teens, perform oral sex on him while he made business calls. That girl’s name was Monica Lewin —   No! Wrong again! That was Bill Clinton, too! Please don’t stop reading. Let me find my Trump notes  …     What I meant was that Trump was the one who later smeared that girl as a delusional stalker. She may have volunteered for the sex  —   at around age 20  —   but Monica Lewinsky didn’t volunteer to be slandered! And yet this fiend, this    this retrograde misogynist, Donald Trump, deployed his journalist friends, like Sidney Blumenthal, to spread rumors that Monica was a stalker, trying to blackmail the president. Oh, boy  —   this is embarrassing. This must seem very sloppy. That wasn’t Trump either it was Hillary Clinton. There must be something here that was Trump  …     Here! I have one. When an attractive woman desperately in need of a job came to Trump’s office in 1993, instead of helping, he lunged at her, kissed her on the mouth, grabbed her breast and put her hand on his genitals. He later told a mistress that the claim was absurd because the woman, Kathleen Willey, had such small breasts.    —   you’re not going to believe this, but  —   yep, that was Bill Clinton. This one, I’m sure was Trump. In January 1992, Trump went on 60 Minutes to slime nightclub singer Gennifer Flowers, knowing full well she was telling the truth. He implied she belonged in a loony bin, telling millions of viewers “every time she called, distraught  …     she said sort of wacky things. ” Dammit! I don’t know how this keeps happening. That wasn’t Trump! That was Hillary, smearing one of her husband’s sexual conquests. Let’s just go back to the Times‘ story, based on months of investigation and interviews with hundreds of women. I’ll give it to you straight: When Trump was at the New York Military Academy as a teenager, one person who knew him said  —   and this is corroborated by two other witnesses: “Donald was extremely sensitive to whether or not the women he invited to campus were pretty. ” I almost threw up reading that. I am physically ill."
"EXCLUSIVA: Mandos de Carteles Mexicanos se Reunieron en la Frontera con Texas, Planean Nuevas Rutas",Breitbart,Cartel Chronicles,2016-11-14,"MATAMOROS, Tamaulipas  —   Los líderes de dos de los carteles mas poderosos de Mexico se reunieron en esta ciudad fronteriza con el fin de reforzar alianzas, trazar nuevas rutas y territorios para el trafico de drogas y discutir la lucha con sus rivales. [Una testigo de la reunión confirmo de forma exclusiva a Breitbart Texas que la semana pasada, mientras el enfoque del mundo estaba en las elecciones estadounidenses, los líderes del Cartel del Golfo en Matamoros se reunieron con sus contrapartes del cartel de Los Zetas Vieja Escuela en un intento por concretar la alianza denominada “Carteles Unidos. ” Fuentes federales de inteligencia del gobierno Mexicano confirmaron de manera extraoficial a Breitbart Texas la información sobre la junta y la solidificación de la alianza entre los grupos criminales.   La reunión se llevo acabo en el centro de Matamoros comenzando a las 11 de la mañana y durando mas de 6 horas los participantes se retiraron después de las 5 de la tarde en una forma discreta. El evento fue organizado Sergio “Sr. Cortez” Ortegón,  el cual es el actual líder del Cartel Del Golfo en Matamoros. Los invitados incluyeron los jefes de plaza del grupo Zetas Vieja Escuela de Oaxaca, Tabasco, Nuevo Leon, San Luis Potosí, Coahuila, Veracruz y Quintana Roo.  Como Breitbart Texas ha reportado anteriormente, el grupo Zetas Vieja Escuela ha estado en guerra con otro grupo Zeta denominado Cartel Del Noreste (CDN). La lucha ha detonado la violencia en Tamaulipas y se ha expandido a otros estados incluyendo Nuevo Leon y Coahuila.  El tema de principal de la junta fue la apertura las fronteras y terminar con tensiones entre los grupos presentes. El Cartel del Golfo en Matamoros abriría sus rutas de trasiego de drogas y el apoyo logístico del Cartel del Golfo en la frontera mientras que los Zetas Vieja Escuela no solo pagarían por los servicios sino que también proporcionarían entrenamiento, armamento y de ser necesario grupos de choque.  Miembros del Cartel Del Golfo en Reynosa, liderados por Julian “Comandante Toro” Loiza Salinas no fueron invitados a la reunión. Fuentes de inteligencia en ambos lados de la frontera confirmaron a Breitbart Texas que entre hay una fuerte animosidad entre Cortez y Toro. En el 2015, las fuerzas del CDG en Matamoros y las fuerzas del CDG en Reynosa chocaron en una sangrienta guerra.  Según el testigo de la junta, tanto los Zetas Vieja Escuela como el CDG en Matamoros han llevado acabo una “limpia” en la cual se han dedicado a atacar a secuestradores y asaltantes en un intento por regresar a los tiempos donde los carteles se dedicaban exclusivamente a el trafico de droga sin increpar a los ciudadanos. Breitbart Texas ha reportado en algunos casos que han incluido las ejecuciones de secuestradores y la tortura de asaltantes. El grupo CDN y el CDG en Reynosa han sido vinculados a la extorsión, el secuestro y otros crímenes como una forma de diversificar sus ingresos.  Editor’s Note: Breitbart Texas traveled to the Mexican States of Tamaulipas, Coahuila and Nuevo León to recruit citizen journalists willing to risk their lives and expose the cartels silencing their communities.

Pakistani Man Arrested for Alleged Plot to Bomb Brasilia Airport,Breitbart,Frances Martel,2016-07-11,"Authorities arrested a    Pakistani man in Brazil Sunday after his wife told police he was planning to bomb the Brasilia International Airport. Brazil is on high alert for jihadi activity as it prepares for the 2016 Summer Olympics beginning in August. [The man, whose name law enforcement officials did not release, was allegedly planning a bomb attack on Brasilia’s Juscelino Kubitschek Airport on Monday. His wife told police he had amassed explosives in his home for that purpose. She also told police he was looking to return to Pakistan that Monday.  While he is described as a Pakistani national, at least one report identifies him as having been born in Algeria. He is said to have arrived in Brazil in 2014 and married, his wife being a Brazilian native. The couple subsequently split after she found out that, to marry her, the man had forged a death certificate for a woman he had married in Pakistan. Brazil’s O Globo newspaper reports that a search of the man’s premises found no explosives on Monday, but the man has not denied the plot. When police asked him whether he was seeking to bomb the airport, the newspaper reports that he invited police to go to the airport “to find out. ” Police described the man as speaking “in a very disturbed way. ” Lt. Col. Itamar Valverde of the Brazilian police told reporters that the matter is being taken seriously, particularly in the context of the Olympics. “For the Military Police, the Olympics began a long time ago,” he asserted. “We are focused on ensuring the safety of the capital and treating all complaints and incidents very seriously. ” Threats of potential jihadist activity around the upcoming Olympic Games have been circulating for at least a year. In March 2015, Brazilian newspapers began to report that police had reason to believe the Islamic State ( ) had begun recruiting terrorists in Brazil to launch attacks from the ground. As ISIS has no known infrastructure tying its leadership in Iraq and Syria to Brazil, the recruiting efforts were reportedly being done through propaganda and social media targeting of individuals who may be sympathetic to the jihadist message. Last week, Brazilian police announced that they had intercepted jihadist messages in Portuguese on the encrypted communications app Telegram, a favorite among Islamic State supporters. “We understand that the creation of an account can be the opening of a door to radicalize Brazilian,” a national security official told Reuters. Adding to the alarm is the disappearance of Jihad Ahmed Diyab, a former Guantánamo Bay detainee who was released to Uruguay in 2014. Diyab’s whereabouts are currently unknown, but he was last heard from allegedly traveling to the   border to observe the Ramadan Muslim holy month. There is no record of Diyab entering Brazil, though Uruguayan officials have insisted that many travel across that border without being officially documented in Brazil. While recent reports place Diyab in Venezuela, there is little evidence confirming any rumor regarding his location. Diyab can only walk using crutches, which limits his movement, and he does not speak Spanish or Portuguese. He asserted while in Uruguay that he was not an   member when he was arrested by American forces, but that while in captivity, he grew to sympathize with it. As he was arrested before the Islamic State declared itself independent of   his attitudes towards the group are unknown."
Dems Push Bill to Bar Persons 16-and-Under from Shooting AR-15s,Breitbart,AWR Hawkins,2016-07-13,"On Tuesday Democrats in the House and Senate put forward legislation to bar individuals 16 years and younger from shooting  .

According to The Hill, the ban was put forth by Senator Ed Markey ( .) and Representative Ruben Gallego (  ). Markey released a statement with the ban, saying, “The small hands of children and big power of machine guns are a deadly combination. Assault weapons are weapons of war and should not be allowed in the hands of children. ” The ban is being pushed beside a Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence petition which is also aimed at placing “age restrictions” on shooting   and related firearms. The Brady Campaign said, “We’re now calling upon kids across the nation and their parents support this brave bill by signing our petition. Kids and assault weapons don’t mix. ” The bill is expected to go nowhere. AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.

Mark Wahlberg: ’Catholic Faith Is the Anchor That Supports Everything I Do’ - Breitbart,Breitbart,Dr. Susan Berry,2016-10-06,"Actor Mark Wahlberg is promoting an online video in which he says he will be praying for vocations to the priesthood and supporting the work of Catholic diocesan vocation directors. [“I want you to know my support for your work to foster vocations to the priesthood, because I want my children and future generations to have good priests in their lives, just like I had,” Wahlberg says in the video, posted on Facebook by the vocations office of the Diocese of Providence, Rhode Island.  “My Catholic faith is the anchor that supports everything I do in life,” the actor continues. “In my daily prayers, I ask for guidance, strength in my vocation as a husband and as a father. ” As the Boston Pilot reports, Wahlberg, who starred in The Perfect Storm, Planet of the Apes, The Departed, and The Fighter, recorded the video to serve as a greeting for the National Conference of Diocesan Vocation Directors.

Wahlberg, who lives in Boston, says in the video that he has experienced “many wonderful priests” in his life. “Growing up in Dorchester, I got myself into trouble now and then but I always had a priest to stick by me,” he says, adding: I was married by a priest. My children were baptized by a priest. And whenever somebody in my family passed away, they’ve all been buried by a priest. My sins have been forgiven when I go to confession to a priest. Every time I go to Mass, it’s through a priest’s hands that I receive the Body and Blood of Jesus Christ, which strengthens me to share my Catholic faith with others. “We the Catholic faithful are counting on you to bring us good and holy priests,” Wahlberg says. “Enjoy my hometown this week, and know that I will pray for you and for your success.

[CBS Detroit found a homeless man named Abe Hagenston who uses a cell phone to swipe credit cards when people respond to his calls for alms.  Hagenston, who calls himself “Honest Abe,” was panhandling near the 8 Mile overpass on   when the TV news folks caught up with him. Abe proudly noted that he has helped organize some of the panhandlers in his area into a union of sorts. He says they’ve worked out a schedule to panhandle in shifts to avoid stepping on each other’s territory. Disappointed that Detroit hasn’t seen much snow to shovel for extra cash, “Honest Abe” said his intake hasn’t been as good as it could be. But the new credit card swiper is helping. “I take VISA, MasterCard, American Express,” Abe said. “I’m the only homeless guy in America who can take a credit card. It’s all done safely and securely through square. com. ” The credit card reader Abe is talking about is a small device by a company called Square that can be plugged into a cell phone which turns the phone into a credit card scanner. Many small businesses and some bars and restaurants have turned to using the Square readers instead of purchasing the larger,   machines we are all familiar with. According to The Roanoke Times, 63 percent of transactions processed with the Square system come from sellers with less than $125, 000 in annual payments. “Square definitely has cornered that market,” Meghan Cieslak, a spokeswoman for the Electronic Transactions Association, a trade group for companies that process payments electronically, told the paper. “They’ve simplified the process, which I think for small merchants, it saves them a lot of time. ” Despite the growth in the use of its services, though, Square is still not a profitable company. In the last quarter of 2015, Square reported net losses of up to $54 million, bringing total losses to about $131. 5 million for 2015. The company also reported a net loss of $154 million in 2014. As to Detroit, in 2015 the number of homeless actually decreased a little over the number seen in 2013. The city recently reported there were 2, 748 homeless individuals in the Motor City last year, down 282 individuals as counted in 2013.

John Bolton Agrees with Bernie Sanders: Hillary Clinton not Qualified to Be President - Breitbart,Breitbart,Dan Riehl,2016-04-07,"Asked about Bernie Sander’s recent comments that Hillary Clinton is not qualified to be President, former UN Ambassador John Bolton told Breitbart News Daily host Stephen K. Bannon,”I think he’s right. ”[“If you look at her record as Secretary of State, other than having a huge carbon footprint by traveling all over the world on U. S. military aircraft, her accomplishments which you can actually ascribe to her are almost  . The foreign policy was Barack Obama’s, that’s for sure, but there’s nothing she’s done that really demonstrates she knows how to be Secretary of State, let alone be President,” Bolton said.  He added: “I think Sanders would have been in much better shape if he had gone on this offensive earlier. If he had said, for example, on the email, look, this is a matter of national security, there’s an FBI investigation” that would have made it clear he takes it seriously. “I think he would have gotten another ten or fifteen percent in the polls. If he loses this nomination, I blame it on Sanders, not the wonders of the Clinton campaign,” Bolton concluded. Bolton’s criticism didn’t stop there. “A lot of people, including among some conservatives, say Hillary is actually more of a hawk than Barack Obama, she would be tougher in foreign affairs than Barack Obama. That is flatly wrong. She was happily his Secretary of State for the first four years of the administration,” Bolton argued. “I’ve read her memoir, all 600 tedious pages of it. You have to strain hard to find differences in that memoir between her and Obama. And I think given what she’s had to do in her competition with Bernie Sanders just to get the Democratic Party nomination  —   some say she’s moved to the Left. I knew her in law school. She was a year ahead of me. That’s where she’s always been. She’s not moving anywhere. She’s just revealing where she’s been most of her professional life. Her foreign policy and Barack Obama’s are going to be indistinguishable, and people need to understand that, whether it’s on the immigration question really or anything else. ” Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00AM to 9:00AM EST.

 Migrants In Sweden Three Times More Likely To Suffer From Mental Illness,Breitbart,Chris Tomlinson,2016-03-17,"A new study released by the BMJ medical journal has said that migrants suffer from mental illnesses like paranoid schizophrenia, psychotic disorders and depression at far higher rates than their Swedish counterparts. [Sweden’s Karolinska Institute and University College London used information obtained from 1. 3 million teenagers by the Swedish national register who kept track of them for 13 years, reports The Local. The sample group was split into Swedish born citizens with Swedish parents, asylum seekers, and migrants from the Middle East, North Africa, Southern Africa, Asia and Eastern Europe.  In every 10, 000 migrants they found that 12 or so exhibited signs of schizophrenia or suffered from psychotic episodes compared to only 4 in 10, 000 for native Swedes.   Hollander, who heads the study for the Karolinksa’s Department of Health said, “the dramatically increased risk among refugees shows that life events are a significant risk factor for schizophrenia. ” Another separate study of 15   also saw a dramatic rise in mental illness. The study by the World Health Organization states that Swedish 15   children have the highest rate of mental illness of anywhere in Europe, and they also have one of the the lowest rates of alcohol and cigarette use. Swedish boys who say that they drink alcohol at least once a week fell 9. 5 pe rcent from 2010 to 2014 and the figures were even more dramatic for girls who saw an 11. 4 per cent decrease in alcohol consumption. The figures have made Sweden one of the five countries with the lowest alcohol use among teens. Other Scandinavian countries have followed a similar trend in regards to drinking among teens but Sweden, it is said, is the only one to see a spike in mental illness. In 2010 Sweden had an average rate of mental illness rating at about 19th out of 39 countries studied. In 2014 Sweden was rated 8th out of 42 countries studied. The other Nordic countries, Norway, Denmark and Finland are the opposite and rank among the five countries with the lowest rates of mental illness."

Tom Brokaw: Give Trump ‘Credit’ for Getting More Americans Involved in Politics - Breitbart,Breitbart,Tony Lee,2016-01-28,"On Thursday’s Breitbart News Daily (6AM to 9AM on Sirius XM Patriot channel 125) veteran NBC newsman Tom Brokaw said he credits GOP frontrunner Donald Trump for bringing in more Americans to the political process. [In a   interview on domestic and international affairs, Brokaw told host and Breitbart News Executive Chairman Stephen K. Bannon that he “will give Mr. Trump credit” for that and joked that though some have come into the political process because they “want to do anything they can to make sure he doesn’t succeed,” others “quite obviously are involved in the process now because they have someone who speaks their mind. ”  The key to Trump’s success will be how many of his supporters from outside of the traditional political system go to the polls and vote. Brokaw said that since Trump has about 30% of the support before votes have been cast, he could inherit the support of other candidates or “everybody else will consolidate around one or two candidates” once “we have a winnowing out. ” “We’ll see what happens to the poll numbers,” he said, adding that it is “heartening” that “people are really paying attention” to this election. He also said there is an “anxiety now among the elite liberal groups about what is going on” and the rise of populism and nationalism that have powered Trump’s candidacy. Brokaw said he was recently at a book party where elite New Yorkers were talking about Trump and he had to remind attendees that “you have to understand the country doesn’t end at the Hudson River’s edge. ” He said people have “different kind of requirements of how you manage your lives and what your goals are” and those living in New York will have different values than people in Livingston, Montana, where Brokaw has a ranch and spends some of his time. He said he has a lot of friends out in Montana —  ranchers,   guys, barkeeps —  and “they all have lots of different points of views. ” He said there has to be a “determination to be open to other points of view as well. ” Regarding the war against Islamic Jihad, Brokaw said it is not like “anything quite like we’ve encountered before” with terror groups “reverting to   tactics to advance their cause” as the Shias and Sunnis fight for dominance. He said that terror groups have “touched a nerve in the wider Islamic world” and that is the “most unsettling part. ” Brokaw said that “we’re fighting a different kind of war” and acknowledged that “we have so many people getting permits” for guns because “there is great anxiety about the war coming to our shores” and more Americans think “they’re going to have to defend themselves at home. ” The Greatest Generation author said he still keeps in touch with the still “very attentive citizens” of the Greatest Generation and he said in both parties, no one “has what I see is a   view of how we’re going to deal with this, but there’s a real urgency about it. ” He said America is facing a different type of asymmetrical warfare now and not even America’s   allies in the Middle East “have a way of knowing how and when this might end and what victory” will look like since there is “not going to be any surrender ceremony on the Missouri” where ISIS’s flag is lowered. Brokaw said the Bush Administration falsely thought they had a victory as soon as they got to Baghdad and “there’s been a regression” in the War on Terror “because of the development of ISIS” under the Obama administration. He said Islamic Jihad is an “overarching problem” for the West and nost just a “Republican problem or a Democratic problem” because it really is a “clash of the cultures, beliefs, and what’s in the best interest of civilization. ” Regarding Millennials, Brokaw said “their time is not over so we have to wait and see” if they turn out to be like the Greatest Generation. He said “they don’t hear a call from either party for what the reality of the situation is” in the War on Terror and only hear “exaggerated promises about what can be done. ” He said Millennials are likely willing to “play their part” like other generations but “leadership across the political spectrum doesn’t really reach out to them. ” Brokaw said he thinks that “it is immortal for a Democratic republic” to send less than 1% of the population to war while the “99%  of us are not asked to make any sacrifices whatsoever. ” Brokaw and Bannon agreed that George W. Bush’s call to go shopping is clearly “not sacrifice. ” “It is confined to a very very small percentage of our population,” he said. “No one else is asked to think about any kind of sacrifice at home. ” To that end, Brokaw suggested a   tax on gas prices where 2. 5 cents would to go debt   up the military and another 2. 5 cents to public works projects. “We have to pay a price here,” he said. Brokaw also spoke about the water crisis in Flint, Michigan. He said the failures in Flint are emblematic of how quickly   communities can “become victims to [government officials] who are not paying attention or regulations gone amok” and the “consequences are almost too drastic to contemplate at this point. ” He said the Flint crisis “represents the frustrations of our country about the failure of our leaders and the dangers of modern life. ” "
Zika-Linked Mosquitoes ’Infesting’ Orange County - Breitbart,Breitbart,Michelle Moons,2016-02-03,"Aggressive tropical mosquitos —  a breed that can carry the Zika virus —  are “infesting” Orange County, California, authorities warn. [The invasive species —  which can also carry yellow fever, dengue fever and chinungunya —  could pose a risk to the public.  None of the mosquitoes in question has yet been found to be carrying Zika, but could provide a vector for its transmission. Authorities recently admitted that there have been six Zika cases in the last three years in California, and that the mosquitos responsible for Zika have been found in 12 of the 58 counties in California. Aedes aegypti, or yellow fever mosquitos, were reported in Orange County last October. The Orange County Mosquito and Vector Control District (OCMVCD) stated at the time that the mosquitos had been found in Anaheim earlier in the year, but had not been seen since an area resident’s April 2015 report. “The Yellow Fever mosquito is a small but aggressive   species,” the OCMVCD wrote, in a flyer urging the public’s assistance. “The Yellow Fever mosquito breeds in small containers, particularly the types of container found in residential yards. We are asking you to call Orange County Mosquito and Vector Control District at (714)   if you are bitten during the day by a mosquito. ” Rober Cummings with the OCMVCD told Fox 11 local news in an interview that the yellow fever mosquito looks different than local Orange County mosquitos, which tend to be brown. The   mosquitos are black and white striped. An October warning from the OCMVCD stated: The yellow fever mosquito is recognizable by its bright silver   marking and white banded legs. They can live both indoors and outdoors, and primarily bite humans. Female mosquitoes lay their eggs in containers holding as little as a teaspoon of water, and eggs, which are laid just above the water line, can survive dry conditions for six months or more. The   insect was “first identified in California’s central valley and central coast in June of 2013, and last year in Los Angeles County,” according to the OCMVCD. “it is generally accepted that the transportation of dormant eggs attached to items such as imported tires and plants, is commonly associated with introductions of this mosquito species. ” It remains unconfirmed whether the rapidly spreading Zika virus actually causes birth defect microcephaly, but the World Health Organization (WHO) this week declared a global emergency over the virus. There has however, been a spike in the “small head” birth defect in Brazin since discovery of the virus there last year. An estimated 80 per cent of cases don’t produce symptoms in those stricken according to the Associated Press. There is currently no known treatment for the virus.

Kellyanne Conway: ‘Trump and Cruz Locked in Arms’ Against Establishment ‘Parachute’ Convention Candidate - Breitbart,Breitbart,Michelle Moons,2016-04-02,"Ted Cruz PAC leader, president, and pollster Kellyanne Conway joined the Breitbart News Saturday radio program with guest host and Washington political editor Matthew Boyle. Conway discussed the state of the Republican primary, with two strongly   candidates leading the race heading into Tuesday’s Wisconsin primary. [Cruz has been surging in Wisconsin recently with the endorsement of the state’s Gov. Scott Walker and two new polls putting Cruz solidly in the lead over GOP delegate count frontrunner Donald Trump.  “Donald Trump’s campaign has had a really rocky week or so and it’s being reflected in the polls,” Conway said during the Saturday radio program on SiriusXM Patriot. “There’s been very little growth for Donald Trump I think over the last seven to ten days Matt. He gets those voters early and they stick with him, they’re very loyal, but the growth opportunity has been the   vote, not the Trump vote, of late. ” Boyle asked how the Cruz campaign is preparing to prevent the establishment from swooping in with a candidate that is neither of the top two candidates, Trump or Cruz. Conway responded: Trump and Cruz people are really locked in arms as one on that major question which is, will they subvert the entire will of the people, and just parachute in, slide in somebody who has not been part of this process at all, who didn’t even run, or, Plan B of course Matt is slide in somebody who ran and was soundly rejected by the voters and has since left the race. Conway said that even some establishment lawyer types are trying to steer establishment party leadership away from such a strategy. She remarked it has not been attempted in the history of modern politics and would likely lose those that have “beaten the establishment soundly. ” The fact that Trump and Cruz are the last two serious candidates standing and both are pretty much of a single mind on immigration is called causation, not coincidence   …     they’ve been able to build the trust among voters on a core issue that I think the establishment has missed for years. Including, if not especially, in the famous Republican autopsy from a couple years ago Matt, where the only substantive issue the RNC took on was immigration and insisted that we have comprehensive immigration reform owing to the fact that Mitt Romney was only able to cobble together 27 per cent of the Hispanic vote. “That’s been completely turned on it’s head,” Conway said. Working class voters are looking at illegal immigration not only as an issue of border security, but also national security and as an economic issue. Boyle and Conway went on to discuss Democrat   candidate Hillary Clinton, who is struggling to stay ahead of   socialist Bernie Sanders for the Democrat Party nomination.

"Cirque du Solei Cancels North Carolina Shows Over Public Facilities Act — Plans Shows In Dubai, Where Gays Are Put to Death - Breitbart",Breitbart,Jerome Hudson,2016-04-15,"  circus and theater entertainment company Cirque du Soleil has canceled its upcoming shows in Greensboro, Charlotte, and Raleigh in North Carolina to protest the state’s Public Facilities Privacy and Security Act. [“Cirque du Soleil strongly believes in diversity and equality for every individual and is opposed to discrimination in any form,” the group announced Friday in a press release. “The new HB2 legislation passed in North Carolina is an important regression to ensuring human rights for all. ”  Cirque du Soleil’s North Carolina cancelation comes as a growing number of artists and entertainers abandon their respective performances in the state to protest of the Public Facilities Privacy  Security Act. The   circus, however, has not canceled its upcoming performances in the United Arab Emirates of Dubai. Indeed, Cirque du Solei has a planned production, Varekai, scheduled to run from September 16 to 24 at the Dubai World Trade Centre. The United Arab Emirates of Dubai has outlawed   marriage, sex or gender reassignment surgery, adoption by   couples, openly gay and lesbian military service, with the aforementioned being punishable by death, fines, or imprisonment. In fact, Cirque du Solei has performed for years in the   United Arab Emirates, including Michael Jackson: The Immortal Tour in 2014, Dralion in 2013, Alegria in 2009, and Quidam in 2006. “Over the past years, Cirque du Soleil has had shows in various countries such as United Arab Emirates,” the Cirque du Solei website proudly states. While calling North Carolina’s Public Facilities Privacy  Security Act “an important regression to ensuring human rights for all,” it’s unclear if Cirque du Soleil plans to cancel its upcoming shows in nations that put homosexuals to death.

Michael Pack on George Washington and Alexander Hamilton,Breitbart,John Hayward,2016-07-04,"Michael Pack, president of the Claremont Institute, was a guest of Breitbart News Daily’s American Revolution Special, where he talked with SiriusXM host Stephen K. Bannon about the illustrious subjects of his critically acclaimed films Rediscovering George Washington and Rediscovering Alexander Hamilton. [Washington, of course, was the “indispensable man” of the Revolution, “the Founding Father you could least do without,” as Pack hailed him.   Contrary to Washington’s modern image as “staid and reserved and cold,” Pack noted that he was one of the most charismatic men of his age, regarded as such by friends and enemies alike. “We’re   in some ways, by the paintings and busts of Washington, very late in his life,” said Pack. He added: He was a young hero. He was an intrepid and, perhaps, overly courageous figure in the French and Indian War, where he got into some trouble, and he was a courageous figure in the American Revolution. When soldiers saw him, their courage was reinforced. He was a symbol of steadfastness. He was unafraid. Bullets whizzed past him. He always put himself at the front of the action. He noted that another lost aspect of Washington’s character was his occasionally volcanic temper, noted by both eyewitnesses to some of his most powerful eruptions on the battlefield and by Jefferson and Hamilton at cabinet meetings. “We have a scene at the Battle of Monmouth where General Lee failed to do what Washington wanted. He rode up to him and yelled at him in front of all the troops. People wrote about it for many years afterward,” said Pack. “He was so excited, someone once said it was like the leaves were going to fall from the trees. Incompetence did not make Washington happy. ” Washington’s courage and charisma held his underpaid,   and   revolutionary army together through the toughest years of the war, but it was his genius as a military strategist that eventually brought victory. The most difficult lesson he learned was that his forces were no match for the mighty British army in open field engagements. “He trained them to where they could at least meet the British and fight them to a standstill, but he realized he had to fight a war of attrition,” said Pack: He had to not engage the British and just outlast them, and let their very long supply lines, all the way back to Britain, and their many other worldwide commitments bleed the British. So he was forced to fight a kind of war he did not want to fight, but he was a great general because he figured out the kind of war he needed to fight  —   and then he fought it, whether it was to his taste or not. Another forgotten aspect of Washington’s revolutionary campaign is that, despite his personal charisma and the high esteem in which he was held, he had plenty of enemies within the Colonies seeking to undermine his command. It is hard for the modern audience to imagine so many people trying to stab George Washington in the back, but Pack said that is exactly what happened. Pack said: Especially at the beginning of the war, the famous Conway Cabal  —   other generals wanted the power that he had. When he was not winning, they were saying they could do better, and many in Congress who were not themselves militarily trained were very sympathetic. We had, especially in the beginning years of the war, many attempts to unseat him, especially given this strategy, that he was not fighting this aggressive attack, attack system, but he was trying to tire the British out. It looked like he wasn’t winning, the way that Congress wanted to win. “The Continental Congress, like everyone, wanted a fast war, and there’s always a general that will promise people a fast war. But Washington was fighting the only war that we could win, and it wasn’t fast. So that set him up for these many acts of betrayal,” he stated, continuing: And Washington was smart. He handled all those political maneuvers brilliantly. He rarely confronted the general that was trying to get around him. He’d find a way, and sooner or later, that general was shorn of his power and out. Washington was patient and calculating, where the rest of us, we’ve all had people betray us, it’s very hard not to fight back immediately. Pack said that one of Washington’s greatest virtues was his immense   which kept his fiery passions in check, helped him plan and execute   strategies in both war and politics, and led to “the two greatest acts that he ever did for America, that are beyond what anyone else had ever done. ” One of those acts was leading a revolutionary army to victory, which Pack observed is quite rare in the annals of history. The other was refusing to seize power, as nearly every other successful revolutionary leader before him had done  —   and nearly every revolutionary leader to come after him, for that matter. After winning the Revolutionary War, Washington handed his commission back to Congress and went home to Mt. Vernon. “When you have the temptation to be a great leader, and you have all the power in your hands, no one had given it up before,” Pack marveled. “George III famously said, ‘If he will do that, then he will be the greatest figure of the age.’ Washington did it, and was the greatest figure of the age. ” In fact, Washington did it twice, when he retired from the presidency after only two years, despite the Constitution at the time allowing him to hold the office for life. “He thought it was important to have a peaceful transition to power in a republic, and he voluntarily left office and gave up power a second time. Had Washington been president for the rest of his natural life, it would have set an incredibly bad precedent,” said Pack. Bannon saluted Pack’s Rediscovering Alexander Hamilton as “not only breathtaking, but groundbreaking,” paving the way for the   Broadway play about Hamilton. Pack said his approach was to rediscover Hamilton from a contemporary perspective, which fortune (ill fortune, that is) just happened to provide in the form of the 2008 financial crisis. “Hamilton weathered the first financial crisis in the (Seventeen) Nineties, so we talked to   Secretary Hank Paulson, about whether Hamilton would do as he did, and what he thought of what Hamilton did,” Pack recalled. “And since Hamilton also was in a duel over honor, we talked to former gang members who had also been in duels over honor, and we asked them what they thought of the   duel, and they had a lot to say, both good and bad. ” Pack agreed with Bannon that much of Hamilton’s renewed popularity stems from his character as a “modern” man, well ahead of his time in many ways. “Hamilton is a great man,” he declared, noting that his historical reputation suffered from his many battles with Thomas Jefferson, who “outlived him, and was able to write the history. ” “Somehow Thomas Jefferson became a champion of the Democratic Party, so the Democrats for a while were   and ” Pack observed. He credited historian Forrest McDonald’s for launching the Hamilton renaissance with his 1982 biography, in which he took on “this sort of Charles Beard theory that all the Founders were just acting out of their   that they were just rich landowners, and all they cared about was maximizing their property. ” “Hamilton was a good   to that, a man who had hardly any property,” said Pack. “He is a modern man. It’s Hamilton’s vision of America that has come to predominate. He came to New York City, and he was able to envision a great commercial republic rising up, with manufacturing and commerce as important as agriculture. ”  “Many of the rich plantation owners, like his great   Jefferson, and Madison for that matter, had a harder time seeing that. They thought it was all going to be farming. Virtue was in farming. We should all be farmers. It was important to be close to the land,” he said. “Hamilton had a vision that is closer to the modern vision. ” Pack added that Hamilton was “an immigrant from the West Indies,” so he “wanted a place where people could come from the outside, like he did, and make it, through hard work and genius. ” Alexander Hamilton did not start with many advantages in life. Pack noted that his childhood was “one horror after another,” with his father leaving while Hamilton was young, then his mother dying, and the uncle who became his guardian committing suicide.  Pack added: He was poor, he was illegitimate, his family was always on the margins of white society in the West Indies, where that mattered. And he was able to overcome that. He was very lucky that he worked for a merchant house, Beekman and Cruger, where they recognized his skill, and he had a local minister, Knox, who also recognized his skill, and they raised money to send him to college. “Without that  —   individual people, not the government, raising money and sending him off to college  —   who knows what Hamilton would be?” he wondered.  What Hamilton did become was a virtual son to George Washington, part of the brotherhood that fought the long and harsh campaign against the British crown. Hamilton’s fearless performance in the early battles of the war caught Washington’s eye, leading to a position as, in essence, Washington’s chief of staff.  “Hamilton always longed for military glory, and he finally got it at Yorktown, but fighting a war isn’t only about courage in battle, which Hamilton had in excess,” Pack said. “It’s also about this ability to deal with the politics of war, and Hamilton was essential to Washington in that, too. ” He said that Hamilton remained an inspiring figure to young people today because his life story “proves that you can make it, if you have energy, and don’t flag. ” “Hamilton did not let obstacles stop him —  not just his early upbringing, but any obstacles,” Pack said with admiration. “He was indefatigable. He worked all the time.   …     He was incessant, and he was dedicated. ” Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m. Eastern. LISTEN: "
"Two Benghazi Parents Sue Hillary Clinton for Wrongful Death, Defamation-NBC News - Breitbart",Breitbart,Breitbart News,2016-08-08,"Pete Williams writes at NBC News:  The parents of two Americans killed in the 2012 terrorist attacks on U. S. diplomatic facilities in Benghazi, Libya, filed a wrongful death lawsuit in federal court Monday against Hillary Clinton. In the suit, Patricia Smith and Charles Woods, the parents of Sean Smith and Tyrone Woods, claim that Clinton’s use of a private   server contributed to the attacks. They also accuse her of defaming them in public statements. Smith was an information management officer and Woods was a security officer, both stationed in Benghazi. “The Benghazi attack was directly and proximately caused, at a minimum by defendant Clinton’s ‘extreme carelessness’ in handling confidential and classified information,” such as the location of State Department employees in Libya, the lawsuit said. While no such connection has ever been established, their lawsuit called it “highly probable” that Clinton sent and received information about the activities of U. S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens. Such information, the lawsuit claimed, “easily found its way to foreign powers” and was then obtained by Islamic terrorists. You can read the rest of the story here."
Rand Paul: Restore the Bill of Rights - Breitbart,Breitbart,Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY),2016-12-15,"Two hundred and   years ago today, a young nation made ten additions to its already revolutionary Constitution. [These amendments  —   this “Bill of Rights”  —   said we could speak our minds, worship freely, defend ourselves, be secure against unreasonable searches and seizures, and expect to be treated fairly if accused of a crime.  In contrast to almost all of the legislation Congress passes today, the Bill of Rights is full of language such as “Congress shall make no law” and “The right of the people  …     shall not be violated,” along with a guarantee that   powers or those not specifically denied the states “are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people. ”  With this document, the Founders drew a line in the sand a few inches from the government’s feet. Not all of these 225 years have been kind to the Bill of Rights, though.  It’s been challenged, debated, and far too often just ignored. Don’t be fooled into thinking this would have surprised the Founders. We have the Bill of Rights precisely because the Founding Fathers knew government can’t resist stretching its limits.  Much like Benjamin Franklin’s reported statement that we had a Republic if we could “keep it,” the Bill of Rights relies on the people holding government accountable. When some in government say “of course we can,” you and I are supposed to use the Bill of Rights to say, “No, you can’t. ” Some believe government has grown too large to hold down with these chains, that it’s too late to rein it back in.  If the Bill of Rights were mere words on paper, perhaps we could afford to indulge that feeling. But they are not mere words.  They are principles fundamental to who we are as a people and what we represent as a nation.  If we stop caring enough to preserve them, we will lose more than a few liberties.  We will become something else entirely. That’s one reason we must defend the entire Bill of Rights.  If you expect to be able to speak freely, then surveillance that shreds the Fourth Amendment stops just being the other guy’s problem.   If you let the government decide the Second Amendment doesn’t mean what it says, then why should it hold to a strict definition of due process or freedom of the press? We don’t have the luxury of playing favorites.  We have the responsibility of getting it right. In a time where so many are divided, this provides us with a clear path forward.  We can unite on a Constitution that binds us together by the same standard, and we can demand all politicians stay within those rules to best benefit us all. If that document needs to be changed, as the Founders expected it would, let’s follow their example by properly amending it, as they did with the ten amendments we celebrate today. There’s no better time than the present to drop the status quo and adopt this “new” approach. I am excited for the upcoming opportunities we will have to institute   reforms, roll back an overzealous and misguided bureaucracy, and return to a government that works for the people instead of the special interests. On this 225th anniversary, let us rededicate ourselves to the principles and boundaries found in the Bill of Rights, and let us recommit to passing them on honored and intact."
Jeb Bush Becomes 10th Amendment Advocate on Education - Breitbart,Breitbart,Dr. Susan Berry,2016-02-06,"Jeb Bush said during the New Hampshire GOP debate the United States should “get back to being a Tenth Amendment country,” one that “respects the states to be able to make more decisions,” including in the area of education. [“And in the Bush administration, we would shift transportation dollars back to the states  …    education dollars, back to the states,” he said on the debate stage. “I would like to see reform take place all across the country, where there’s more vouchers, more freedom. ”  It was in March of last year that Bush —  realizing his candidacy was in peril in part because of his strong advocacy for the unpopular federalized Common Core standards —  began to “retrofit” the facts of Common Core to boost his conservative credentials. “Given all the challenges facing education reform, we need to remember who really should make the decisions about what happens in our schools: state and local authorities and, most important, parents,” Bush wrote in an   in the Washington Post. He added: The federal government’s role in elementary and secondary education should be limited: It should work to create transparency so that parents can see how their local schools measure up it should support policies that have a proven record and it should make sure states can’t ignore students who need extra help. Parents who have been fighting against the Common Core initiative, however, read his   and were eager to respond. “Jeb Bush’s piece in the Washington Post was really quite bizarre and an indicator of the fact that even he now realizes that his   Core stance will most definitely cost him the Republican nomination,” Indiana parent activist Heather Crossin told Breitbart News. “It’s a sign of desperation that the bulk of the article is an attempt to convince the reader that he actually believes in such things as local control of our schools, states’ rights, and parents as the ultimate decision makers of their children’s education. ” While Bush was writing his   in favor of local control of schools, he was also advocating for the reauthorization of the federal No Child Left Behind law. The rewrite —  called the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) —  requires —  among other things —  that the federal government approve of individual state academic standards. “[T]he Obama administration has issued a patchwork of waivers and side deals, given out by fiat and without consistency,” Bush also wrote. “No wonder parents and state and local leaders question Washington’s motives when it comes to our schools. ” The “patchwork of waivers” was all part of the incentivization program of the Common Core initiative, which Bush supported wholeheartedly and urged states to adopt. States could obtain flexibility waivers from the federal government’s NCLB law if they adopted the set of   and   standards. Bush supported the   test consortia that created assessments aligned with the controversial standards. States were also invited to submit applications for federal grant money from President Obama’s 2009 stimulus bill (Race to the Top) if they agreed to adopt the standards and their associated policies, and Obama took credit for Common Core in State of the Union addresses. Activist parents who have been fighting in their states as well as against the new federal education law will likely find it hard to view Jeb Bush as a “10th Amendment” president. Bush also said during the debate he would like to see “more vouchers, more freedom. ” A strong advocate for school choice, Bush chose to mention only school vouchers  —   the method of school choice that has been found to introduce the most regulation into private and religious schools. Since school vouchers involve a transfer of taxpayer funds from public schools to private and religious schools that agree to accept them, increased regulations usually travel with those funds. “More vouchers, more freedom” seem to be contradictory terms."
Central American Illegal Immigrants Continue to Flood U.S. Border at Record Rate,Breitbart,Ildefonso Ortiz,2016-09-23,"MCALLEN, Texas  —   Despite the many assurances provided by the Obama Administration, the flow of Central American illegal immigrants continues to climb and is expected to surpass previous records. [In terms of families illegally entering the country, the number has already surpassed the infamous 2014 amount when the sudden flow of illegal immigrants into south Texas set off a humanitarian crisis.  As Breitbart Texas has been reporting, the area known as the Rio Grande Valley has been pushed to the forefront of the illegal immigration debate. Mexican cartel smugglers have taken full advantage of the system in order to maximize their profits from human smuggling as well as the smuggling of illegal aliens. In 2014, Mexico’s Gulf Cartel was able to make approximately $38 million in a matter of months off human smuggling alone.  According to U. S. Customs and Border Protection, of the 194, 726 detained illegal immigrants from countries other than Mexico, 125, 032 have been apprehended in the Rio Grande Valley (64 percent). The most recent figures from U. S. Customs and Border Protection revealed that in the 2016 fiscal year, authorities have encountered 68, 080 family units, the term used to describe underage immigrants accompanied by at least one adult relative. That figure is already higher than the 66, 144 family units apprehended in 2014. In the case of underage immigrants, during 2016, authorities have apprehended 54, 052, in comparison to the 66, 115 underage immigrants detained in 2014. The   immigration issue, along with the lack of resources, is something agents have been warning about for some time. In May, Breitbart Texas reported on the spike in underage illegal immigrants being apprehended at the border. At the time, members of the National Border Patrol Council sounded the alarm.  “We haven’t seen anything like this since the summer of 2014. The flow is increasing at an alarming rate. If we don’t do something to stem the massive influx, we will likely see numbers that eclipse those of 2014,” said US Border Patrol Agent Chris Cabrera speaking as Vice President for the NBPC Local 3307. “The cartel groups are tying us up on one end with the family groups and running their narcotics because we are caught up doing babysitting duties. ” Earlier this year, Breitbart Texas reported on how in the Laredo sector authorities had managed to apprehend 18, 000 illegal immigrants in just five months. As Breitbart Texas has reported in the past, Laredo is one of the least secure border regions due to its proximity to populated areas, lack of physical barriers, limited use of technology and its diminished number of agents in the field. In the Mexican border city of Reynosa, the criminal organization known as the Gulf Cartel has set up stash houses throughout the region to hold illegal immigrants in preparation for their trip over the river into Texas. The immigrants are taken west towards the area immediately south of Starr County. The area has been a bustling corridor due to its lack of physical barriers and its limited patrolling. Last month, a van carrying 26 illegal immigrants from Central American countries crashed along a Mexican highway near Reynosa. The van had an armed escort that fled the scene. Five immigrants died at the scene of the crash and a sixth one died days later. In June, Breitbart Texas reported on how Mexican authorities had been able to detain dozens of illegal immigrants at those stash houses in Mexico.  Once the cartel smugglers are able to bring illegal aliens over the Rio Grande, they move them to stash houses on the U. S. side where they hold them until they can be moved to their final destination. The journey to the stash house presents a security issued for individuals on the U. S side of the border. Breitbart Texas previously reported, if encountered by law enforcement,  human smugglers routinely flee and start high speed chases through small border cities such as La Joya, Sullivan City and others. The chases have often resulted in tragic crashes that have left dozens injured and resulted in multiple fatalities. Ildefonso Ortiz is an award winning journalist with Breitbart Texas.

Islamic Cleric: Physics Should be Reformed to Conform to Sharia,Breitbart,Ali Waked,2016-09-16,"JAFFA, Israel  —   An internationally renowned Egyptian Islamic cleric has sparked an outcry by saying that “Islamic governments” must be entirely subordinate to Islamic law. [Abu Alfath Alfargaly wrote in an article, published on Wednesday: “Will the [Egyptian] finance minister run the economy and the banks according to Sharia law, that bans interest? Will he allow the export of agricultural goods knowing that they might be used to produce alcohol? Will the foreign minister put the interests of Islam before the interests of his  ?”  According to Alfargaly, the ministers should have a methodical Islamic education. Most controversial were his comments on education. “Will the education minister enact Islamic or secular education? Will the laws of physics that are studied in the secular system, like the law of conservation of energy, be taught from a secular perspective, like today, or changed to include an Islamic perspective, because there’s an accurate Islamic definition of this law. ” The   Islamic activist Muhammad Amin commented on Twitter: “And if the law of the conservation of energy is taught in its ‘secular’ form, does it mean the government is secular infidels?” وفي حال بقي قانون الطاقة بصيغته ”العلمانية” تصبح الحكومة علمانية مرتدة؟ 😊@abazeid89 pic. twitter.   —   محمد الأمين (@ibn_amin) September 15, 2016,  Ahmad Abazeid quoted the controversial paragraph and wrote: “Answer your brother. ” أجيبوا الأخ.. ”قانون بقاء الطاقة في الفيزياء والكمياء هل ستعاد صياغته بطريقة توافق الشرع أم سيظل بصورته العلمانية؟” https:  .   —   أحمد أبازيد (@abazeid89) September 15, 2016,  Abazeid’s dismissive tone annoyed many of Alfargaly’s sympathizers. “Is that your only take away from the article?” Abu Azzam Alshami scolded him. “It’s a wily reading of the article that leads to pathetic insight that leads to a pathetic interpretation. ” @abazeid89 @abdullahalmntsr, هذا الذي فهمت من المقال! !! إدراك سقيم ينتج عنهفهم عقيم ينتج عنهتحليل أبله,  —   أبو عزام الشامي (@It43Z3f3sEELQCv) September 15, 2016,  The debate on physics was soon subsumed by a debate about the right of foreign fighters to decide which government will lead Syria, highlighting a deep resentment between Syrian, Egyptian and Jordanian activists.

The company, traditionally stingy with new stock bonuses, has tried to stem the departures with the   options as more employees consider leaving, according to people familiar with the matter.’ ”The monthly options are designed to allay employee concerns that the typical   waiting period to cash out stock options now looks like a risky proposition, according to sources. At the time the move was made, Yahoo’s stock was trading at a high point, so the accelerated vesting gave employees a chance to take advantage of it.” ’Yahoo declined to comment on the thinking behind the   change, but confirmed that it had rejiggered its stock plans.’ ’”More than a year ago  —   in early January 2015  —   we made changes to our Employee Stock Purchase Program and to the vesting schedule on Restricted Stock Unit awards,” a Yahoo representative said.’ ’Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer is under fire from activist investors, some of whom have called for Mayer to be replaced and for the company to be put on the auction block.

Thousands of flights were canceled, sporting events were called off, bands postponed concerts and NASCAR delayed its Hall of Fame induction ceremony.’ ’Broadway’’s shows were still going on in New York, but as snow fell in Atlanta, people there were urged to stay home all weekend, rather than risk a repeat of the city’’s 2014 ”icepocalypse,” when a relatively mild winter storm caused days of commuter chaos.’ ’Travel was already impossible across a wide swath of the Ohio River valley. Nashville, Tennessee, was gridlocked by accidents. Several drivers died on icy roads in North Carolina. In Washington, Baltimore, and Delaware, archdioceses   excused Catholics from showing up for Sunday Mass.’ ’Coastal flooding and the loss of beaches from high surf were major worries from Delaware north to Long Island. New Jersey’’s Republican Gov. Chris Christie canceled presidential campaign events in New Hampshire, which should be spared from the storm. ”I’’m sorry, NH but I gotta go home  —   we got snow coming,” Christie wrote on Twitter.’ ’Christie met with his Cabinet on Friday night and then declared a state of emergency as forecasters predicted up to 2 feet of snow in parts of the state. The governor asked people to be smart and stay off roadways on Saturday.’ ’In Washington, the federal government closed its offices at noon, and all mass transit was shutting down through Sunday. President Barack Obama, hunkering down at the White House, was one of many who stayed home. Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina addressed   activists at the annual March for Life as the storm closed in.’ ’”I would come here if it were thunderstorming,” said Kristlyn Whitlock, 20, who came from Steubenville, Ohio, wearing four layers of pants and five layers of tops to stay warm.’ ’In downtown Baltimore, social worker Sean Augustus stocked up on flashlights and water, but said his city comes together when disasters strike.’ ’”This is when you’’ll see Baltimore city in a different light,” Augustus said. ”You’’ll see neighbors coming together to help each other. That’’s the side of Baltimore people rarely see. ”’ ’A similar spirit was evident in Annapolis, where 350 Navy midshipmen signed up to shovel people out.’ ”About 7, 600 flights were canceled Friday and Saturday  —   about 15 percent of the airlines’ schedules, according to the flight tracking service FlightAware. They hope to be fully back in business by Sunday afternoon.” ’One of the unlucky travelers stranded by the storm was Jennifer Bremer of Raleigh, North Carolina. Bremer flew into Chicago on Thursday morning, carrying only a briefcase, for what she thought would be less than a day of meetings. Her flight home was canceled Thursday night, and then again Friday.’ ’”I have my computer, my phone and a really good book, but no clothing,” Bremer said as she eyed flight boards at O’’Hare International Airport. ”I have a travel agent right now trying to get creative. I’’m waiting on a phone call from her. . .. I’’m trying to get somewhere near the East Coast where I can drive in tonight or early tomorrow morning. ”’ ’Thousands of track workers, power company employees, road crew members, firefighters, police, National Guardsmen and others mobilized to help out over the long weekend.’ ’”For our region, this is good timing,” said Jeffrey Knueppel, general manager of the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, which is suspending almost all service around Philadelphia Saturday. ”Saturday is the day to stay home and Sunday will give us a chance to really clean things up. ”’"
Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff predicts ’a lot of dead unicorns’ and cheap startups to buy,Business Insider,Julie Bort,2016-01-23,"’’ ’The feeling in the air is that the economy . And that puts strong and growing tech companies like Salesforce in a position to go shopping as stock prices and private valuations decline.’ ”During at the World Economic Forum in Davos this week, Bloomberg asked Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, point blank, if he’s got any plans to step up his acquisitions. ” ’Short answer: probably not.’ ”Benioff said that big acquisitions haven’t really been part of Salesforce strategy for a while. The last big one it did was ExactTarget for $2. 5 billion back in 2013. He didn’t plan to shift gears, but he’s keeping his eyes open. ” ’”When you have deflating asset values, and you’’re the CEO of a company, you’’re going to look at public companies, you’’re going to look at private companies, and you’’re always going to say ’’Are there other organizations who are going to come in [to buy the target company]? ’’” he said. ’ ’However, Salesforce will continue to buy smaller startups, and Benioff thinks such companies ”might be a little cheaper because capital will be more constrained,” he said.’ ’Benioff is  among the   startups, the   unicorns that are said to be worth over $1 billion. ’ ’He said if such highly valued startups didn’’t choose to go public when the economy was hot, they will be in a ”very difficult position” when their ”lofty valuations” decline. ”Those startups will have to raise money at the new reality,” adding, ”there’’s going to be a lot of dead unicorns. ”’"
One of America’s most respected former military officials is worried about the 2016 presidential field,Business Insider,Brett LoGiurato,2016-01-24,"’’ ’Robert Gates hesitated, considering the once     possibility that has become more and more plausible lately.’ ’”Could you imagine a President Donald Trump?” he was asked.’ ’”In all honesty, that’’s difficult for me,” he told Business Insider in an interview earlier this week.’ ’In fact, the entire 2016 presidential field seems to be confounding Gates, one of the   military officials in modern US history.’ ’Gates served as the US secretary of defense under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, and is the only person to have held that position under two presidents of two different political parties.’ ’Yet just more than a week before the first votes are cast in the presidential primaries, none of the current crop of candidates, Gates told Business Insider, stands out as especially presidential.’ ”Hillary Clinton, the Democratic   with whom he worked in the Obama administration, does not have his endorsement. Some of Trump’s rhetoric is not helpful. Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) Trump’s main GOP rival, doesn’t know what he’s talking about.” ’”People are making a lot of grandiose promises and pledges to do one thing or another, either on domestic affairs or on foreign policy,” said Gates, who is promoting ’ ’”But I haven’’t heard anybody really talking about how they would fix some of the problems that they’’re describing and how they would actually implement them,” he added.’ ’Gates went on to take an apparent swipe at Trump, who has proposed to build a wall along the   border and ”make Mexico pay for it. ”’ ’”Some of the rhetoric in terms of how they would deal with problems is frankly totally unrealistic, in terms of making other countries do one thing or another, and so on,” Gates told Business Insider.’ ’”So what we’’re hearing,” he added, ”is people competing with each other to make   and more fantastic promises about all the things they’’re going to change that, in my experience, are completely incompatible with reality. ”’ ’’ ’Gates has been struck by the phenomenon of both Trump and Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ) who has risen as an insurgent challenger to Clinton on the Democratic side.’ ’But he took issue with what he called Trump’’s ”  ” rhetoric, particularly on foreign policy. Trump frequently professes at campaign rallies that his administration ” the Islamic State terrorist group, also known as ISIS. And Trump has been subject to intense criticism for a plan to temporarily bar Muslim tourists and immigrants from entering the country.’ ’”How he intends to deal with issues is pretty unrealistic,” Gates said of Trump.’ ”Gates had perhaps even harsher criticism later in the week for Cruz, who has emerged as Trump’s main threat on the Republican side. Cruz last year  an indiscriminate strategy that critics say would lead to large numbers of civilian casualties.” ’In a Tuesday ”Morning Joe” interview, Gates said the tactic would be ”totally useless” and end up backfiring on decades of US war strategy.’"
Chief Justice John Roberts faces his absolute worst nightmare,Business Insider,,2016-01-24,"’’ ’The ’ ’’ ’’ ’Roberts is a justice who waxes sentimental about judicial restraint at every turn, and now he is being forced to vote in a case that makes a mockery of the very concept.’ ’His mentor, former boss, and predecessor, Chief Justice William Rehnquist, crafted rules that might as well have been designed to forestall this litigation.’ ’Roberts strives to keep his court above politics, and now he must hear a case that is political to its core.  is purportedly a conflict about immigration laws and executive power. But I am starting to think that the entire case is actually a sadistic prank by a bunch of Republican governors who are still furious with Roberts for his votes upholding Obamacare.’ ’Start with judicial restraint. During his confirmation hearing, Roberts  that “my job is to call balls and strikes. ” United States v. Texas . Two Obama executive actions, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals and Deferred Action for Parental Accountability, defer the deportations of people who arrived in the United States as children, known as  and and the undocumented parents of citizens or lawful permanent residents.’ ’Critics of DACA and DAPA claim the programs constitute unlawful executive workaround of existing law. That’s bunkum. Congress has explicitly instructed the executive branch to “establish   …     national immigration enforcement policies and priorities. ”’ ’Current law also grants the secretary of homeland security the power to “establish such regulations” and “issue such instructions” to guide the deportation of undocumented immigrants. With DACA and DAPA, President Obama has simply instructed the Department of Homeland Security to prioritize the deportation of violent felons —  and defer the deportation of DREAMers and their parents. ’ ’Texas and its   argue that, even if the programs are lawful, they are invalid because DHS ran afoul of “notice and comment rulemaking. ” That clunky phrase simply means that DHS, as a government agency, is required to give notice and ask for comment before issuing legislative rules.’ ’But : They’re broader policies about immigration enforcement, and agencies are permitted to issue such policies without notice or comment. The rule of thumb here is that a regulation constitutes a policy when it gives agents enforcement discretion.’ ’DACA and DAPA do just that, asking DHS employees to consider deferent deportment for DREAMers and their parents but not requiring them to do so. That critical detail clearly gave DHS the authority to bypass the    phase.’ ’Perhaps recognizing the flimsiness of its statutory and procedural arguments, Texas tacks on a constitutional claim, arguing that DACA and DAPA violate the Take Care Clause of the Constitution. (“The President   …     shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed. ”) This is really silly, for two reasons.’ ’First, Obama is “tak[ing] care that the laws be faithfully executed” by establishing immigration enforcement policies and priorities, as Congress has directed him to do. Second —  and more gallingly —  the Take Care Clause has never been enforced by the Supreme Court.’ ’It is widely regarded as “nonjusticiable,” meaning federal courts have no authority to enforce it. That makes sense, because Congress has passed thousands of laws, not all of which the president can vigorously enforce simultaneously.’ ’If courts could use the Take Care Clause to force the president’s hand on a certain statute, the federal judiciary would become a scullion of the minority party: Whenever a Democrat holds the presidency, Republicans could sue to make him enforce their favorite statutes and vice versa.’ ’For that reason, courts and legal commentators have long agreed that the clause represents a general constitutional obligation rather than a specific,  duty.’ ’But in the Obama era,  conservative law professors to develop a more robust theory of the Take Care Clause. If Roberts signs off on it, his court will be flooded with highly political lawsuits that will make  look like . ’ ’The Supreme Court would become just another player in a partisan battle, not a lofty third branch perched above politics.’ ’Speaking of: There is really no way to see United States v. Texas as anything but a bitterly partisan dispute between Republican governors and a Democratic executive. Of the 26 states bringing the suit, 26 are controlled by Republican executives.’ ’If this fact makes you question whether the Constitution doesn’t have some safeguard in place to prevent governors from suing a president over a purely political dispute, I have good news: . In order to sue the government,  —  that is, a specific, personalized injury inflicted by the allegedly unlawful government action.’ ’As John Roberts  in 1993, standing rules are designed to keep the judiciary out of the “generalized grievances” that consume “the political branches. ”’ ’Roberts’ predecessor, Rehnquist, was a stickler for standing. His fixation drew ire from liberals and conservatives in turn, but it kept plenty of toxically political cases off his court’s docket. Now Roberts will have an opportunity to further Rehnquist’s legacy —  or spurn it.’ ’Texas argues that it has standing to challenge DACA and DAPA because it may have to provide driver’s licenses to immigrants who are granted deferral. Driver’s licenses. If that gives Texas standing, then standing doctrine no longer has any meaning.’ ’So long as a state can concoct some speculative reason that it might spend a marginal amount of money in response to a federal action, every state will be able to crowbar its way into the courthouse to challenge federal law.’ ’It is possible that Roberts sees United States v. Texas as a straightforward legal dispute and that he won’t let standing issues or political concerns stop him from invalidating DACA and DAPA. It is also possible that Roberts has avoided the news over the past seven months and doesn’t know that a vote for Texas would put him in the same camp as Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. But the chief is a smart man and a savvy jurist.’ ’He is  apolitical votes to save programs he doesn’t like, especially when the legacy of the court is on the line. So yes, Roberts could use United States v. Texas to destroy Obama’s signature immigration achievement. But he could also use the case send a clear message that  to help the Republican Party score   political victories.’"
The world’s wealth is going to just 62 people,Business Insider,,2016-01-24,"’Wealth just keeps growing for the 62 richest people in the world. Collectively, this   group controls $1. 76 trillion, which is about the cumulative worth of the poorer half of the world’s population, or around 3. 5 billion people.’ ’And since 2010, wealth has become more and more concentrated in favor of the richest of the rich while those on the lower rungs of the economic ladder have seen their positions worsen, according to a  from Oxfam International.’ ’The wealth of the richest 62 people grew by more than half a trillion dollars in that last   while the wealth of the poorest 50 percent of people globally decreased by more than $1 trillion during the same period.’ ’“Far from trickling down, income and wealth are instead being sucked upwards at an alarming rate,” the study finds.’ ’There are several reasons for this growing problem according to Deborah Hardoon, Sophia Ayele, and Ricardo   the study’s authors.’ ’The first is the disconnect between work and earnings. The share of national income going to workers has been falling while the share of income given to owners and top executives is rising, a phenomenon that can be seen in the stagnant wage figures of workers around the world despite growing corporate profits and productivity.’ ’Persistent patterns of wage inequality, especially among the poorest workers, can seriously damage global efforts to eradicate poverty.’ ’The study notes that between 1990 and 2010, in many developing nations, the bottom 40 percent of earners saw their wages grow more slowly than the national average.’ ’Had their wage gains simply kept pace with the national averages, 200 million fewer people would be living in extreme poverty around the world.’ ’Currently, the number of people classified as living in extreme poverty, which amounts to surviving on less than $1. 90 per day, is around 700 million.’ ’’ ’Taxes also play a pretty big role in the discrepancies, according to the report. Wealthy clients can hire financial advisors, accountants, and other pricey professionals to help them navigate the tax system, using loopholes to sock their money away in tax havens.’ ’Such efforts have helped keep nearly $8 trillion of money untaxed in offshore accounts, the study finds. Taxing that money isn’t just a matter of fairness, the report argues: The lost public revenues means less money for government programs that aid the poorest and neediest, allowing gaps in education, health care, and quality of life to persist and even grow.’ ’To build an economy that distributes its wealth more evenly, the researchers suggest creating a stronger system of taxation that prevents trillions of dollars from being pulled out of circulation via offshore accounts and allows companies to reduce their tax liabilities via loopholes.’ ’The report also suggests that politics needs to change, diminishing the power that companies exercise through tools like lobbying and patents, which can decrease competition and raise prices.’ ’It’s in everyone’s interest to fix the problem of economic inequality, even those who are thriving amid the increasing inequality.’ ’The study notes that prolonged periods of a widening wealth gap are bad for entire countries, as they can stunt overall economic growth. In a   global economy, that threat’s a problem for everyone, not just those suffering at the bottom.’"

That means fewer workers are needed on the sales floor.” ”Aldi also requires customers to bring their own shopping bags, bag their own groceries, and pay a deposit to use a cart. Customers get their deposit back when they return the cart, so Aldi doesn’t have to pay employees to round up carts.”"

Here’s how much money a self-made millionaire saves to continue growing his wealth,Business Insider,Kathleen Elkins,2016-01-24,"’’ ’If you want to get rich, you have to learn to .’ ’But just how much of your earnings should you set aside for retirement and other savings to ensure lifelong wealth?’ ’For one   millionaire, the magic number is 20%.’ ’”Today, my wife, Michelle, and I each strive to pay ourselves the first 20% of our gross income,” writes David Bach, who became a millionaire by age 30, in his book ”. ”’ ’”That may sound like a lot, but because I’’ve worked up to it gradually over the course of fifteen years, it’’s become our ’’new normal. ’’”’ ’It took a while for Bach to grasp the idea of paying himself first: ”When I first heard about this concept I was doing what most people do  —   trying to budget, beating up on myself for failing, and then scrambling at the end of the year to find some money to put in my retirement and savings accounts, only to find another year had come and gone and I had not made any financial progress,” he writes.’ ’Even when he did start setting aside money, it was a mere 1% of his paycheck, he says: ”I was in my   and I wanted to make sure it didn’’t hurt.

Paul Dano and Daniel Radcliffe star in the strangest movie I’ve ever seen at the Sundance Film Festival,Business Insider,Jason Guerrasio,2016-01-24,"”I’ve seen a lot of weird movies in the nine years I’ve attended the Sundance Film Festival, but this year, I may have seen the strangest one yet.” ’It involves friendship, a dead body, and a lot of flatulence. ”Swiss Army Man” is a comedic   that stars Paul Dano as a lonely guy who, while sailing one day, gets swept up in a storm in the Pacific Ocean and is washed ashore on a deserted island. Daniel Radcliffe is the dead body that washes up at the moment when Dano’’s character, Hank, is about to commit suicide. We’’re not even close to the weird part yet. Directed by  (Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert) who are best known for their music videos and commercial work, the duo have created for their   debut a movie that highlights what it’’s like to be a recluse and not taking chances in life  —   a topic not uncommon to Sundance Film Festival entrants. The story plays out in a fashion that’’s funny, touching, but most importantly, original. Let’’s take the film’’s opening 10 minutes, for example.’ ”After he comes across the dead body, Hank gives this touching speech on how his hopes have been dashed that it isn’t a live person. He’s lonely, and desperate for human contact. But as he opens up in this revealing moment, the dead body passes gas.” ”It’s funny; Hank even finds it amusing, but the body does it again. Even as Hank prepares to try suicide again, the body continues to pass gas. The body then gets pulled into the current and moves further into the water  —   because of its relentless flatulence.  Eventually, Hank sits on top of the body and floats it like a jet ski off the island. The film score is triumphant. Hank is cheering as he moves further away from the island. Is this all a dream? That’s a question you’ll be asking yourself often as the body doesn’t just use its biological function to help Hank out of his predicament, but as Hank continues to search for civilization the body turns into a multipurpose tool. The body chops wood with its arms, can start fires with its fingers, is a source of hydration by spewing water from its mouth  —   which Hank drinks. Importantly, over time, the dead body begins to talk. Manny (the body’s name) is curious about everything and Hank is happy to have someone to share his life with. Hank talks about what he wants to do when he returns home to reunite with his love, Sarah (Mary Elizabeth Winstead).” ’Hank and Manny build little moments from Hank’’s memory with sticks, brush, and trash found in the woods. But there are moments where Hank is too shy to go through with talking to Sarah, and tries to make Manny understand that doing almost anything instinctively will make a person look weird. ”Swiss Army Man” is a look into the side of ourselves that’’s too weird to be revealed in public. But, what the Daniels show here, is that the eccentricities in us that we hide may, in fact, be the best version of ourselves. The Daniels just chose to drive home that point by creating a silly film with   in it. And that’’s the best part of this movie. Because the Daniels were able to land   talent like Dano and Radcliffe in their gonzo movie, it makes your chances of seeing ”Swiss Army Man” outside of the   circuit that much greater. So get ready.’"

Experts warn that the US is underestimating a greater jihadist threat than ISIS,Business Insider,Pamela Engel,2016-01-25,"’’ ’A joint report between two Washington, D. C.  think tanks concludes that the US is dangerously underestimating a jihadist group that could become even more of a threat to the   security of the country than ISIS.’ ’The Institute for the Study of War and the American Enterprise Institute . A group of experts, some of whom were involved in planning the 2007 surge of US troops in Iraq, met over multiple weeks to create the report.’ ’The report said Al Qaeda’’s affiliate in Syria, Jabhat   posed ”one of the most significant   threats” of any jihadist group.’ ’”This Al Qaeda affiliate has established an expansive network of partnerships with local opposition groups that have grown either dependent on or fiercely loyal to the organization,” the report said. ”Its defeat and destruction must be one of the highest priorities of any strategy to defend the United States and Europe from Al Qaeda attacks. ”’ ”While the US’s strategy in the Middle East is heavily focused on ISIS, which is also known as the Islamic State, ISIL, or Daesh, Jabhat   which is also known as the Nusra Front, is spreading its influence through groups that oppose the regime of Syrian President Bashar Assad.” ”Fighters with whom the US partners in Syria have previously been told they must focus on battling ISIS and refrain from attack Assad’s troops. But ISW and AEI pointed out that deposing Assad, a brutal leader who has been accused of massacring his own citizens, is the top priority for many rebels.” ”In that case, they’ll align with the groups with the best funding and equipment that allow them the freedom to fight both ISIS and Assad. In many areas, that group is Jabhat  .” ’”Jabhat   has weakened the moderate opposition and penetrated other Sunni opposition groups in Syria so thoroughly that it is poised to benefit the most from the destruction of ISIS and the fall or transition of the Assad regime,” the report said.’ ’”The likeliest outcome of the current strategy in Syria, if it succeeds, is the de facto establishment and ultimate declaration of a Jabhat   emirate in Syria that has the backing of a wide range of    fighting forces and population groups,” it continued.’ ’ISW and AEI predicted that Jabhat   could then become a key affiliate for the global Al Qaeda terrorist network that focuses on attacking the West.’ ’So far, it appears that Jabhat   has been focused mostly on fighting in Syria. But that could be part of a strategy to avoid scrutiny from Western officials.’ ’”The fact that the US is focused so exclusively on ISIS means that we are ignoring a threat that is as great,” Kimberly Kagan, the founder and president of ISW and one of the authors of the report, told Business Insider.’ ’Jabhat   is playing a ”long game,” Kagan said.’ ’”ISIS is in fact overt about its presence and Nusra is covert about its presence,” she said. ”Nusra’’s covert presence means the US hasn’’t focused enough on its presence. ”’ ’She added: ”Al Qaeda’’s senior leaders have had a deliberate strategy of where they host cells that are planning deliberate attacks against the West at any given moment. Because the US has deliberately targeted Al Qaeda on the basis of whether or not there are attack cells focused on the West, Al Qaeda has tried to minimize the footprint of these cells in areas where it actually wishes to see   success. Syria is the top priority for Al Qaeda. ”’ ’’ ’Other experts, however, have characterized the potential threat from Jabhat   in less dire terms.’ ”Fred Hof, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council who was a special adviser for transition in Syria under Hillary Clinton, then the secretary of state, agreed that Nusra’s resources had attracted many   rebels to the group’s ranks. But he contended that these fighters weren’t very interested in broader operations.” ’”Absent a specific focus on fighting the Assad regime I think it will be difficult for the Nusra Front to exist in any meaningful way in Syria, thereby making it difficult for the group to use Syria as a launching pad for global operations,” Hof told Business Insider.’ ”Hof also pointed out that the US could lure these Nusra recruits back to moderate opposition groups if the moderate groups had resources comparable to Nusra’s.” ’Still, Kagan warns that groups like Nusra intended to attack the West ”whether they’’re actioning that intent right now or not. ”’ ’”US policymakers are underestimating Jabhat   because Jabhat   wishes to be underestimated,” Kagan said.’ ’”We are so focused on ISIS that we are not looking at the second threat,” she added.’ ’And defeating ISIS could unintentionally strengthen Nusra.’ ’Both ISIS and Nusra are Sunni terrorist groups. ISIS has presented itself as a group that can protect Sunnis against the Assad regime, which is aligned with Shiites. Once ISIS is gone, Nusra could step in and assume that role.’ ’”Defeating ISIS inside of Syria is likely to increase the capability and strength of Jabhat ” Kagan said. ”It’s waiting in the wings for ISIS’’ demise in order to establish itself more firmly in key terrain and to present itself as the only reliable ally for the Sunni population. ”’"
Things are so bad in Brazil they had to cancel Carnival,Business Insider,,2016-01-25,"’Following the unwelcome news that Brazil is canceling its popular Carnival, GRI takes a look at what the Brazilian people can expect for their country in 2016 and what changes Brasília needs to make to increase investor confidence.’ ”2016 hasn’t started off well for the arts and culture scene. We have only last week seen the deaths of the legendary star David Bowie and Harry Potter’s dark knight Alan Rickman, and now Brazil is set to mourn its globally known  (at least temporarily) because of the onset of what has been described by economists as the worst recession to hit Brazil since the 1930s.” ’Spirits were high, as was public spending, even during the leviathan 2008 financial crash, but this has all changed in Brazil. The country is facing a breakdown on many fronts including: falling commodity prices, executive corruption, talks of presidential impeachment, increasing unemployment and inflation, a potential virus pandemic, public discontent with the political system, and curbing of   investments.’ ”On August 5, the world’s eyes will turn once more to Brazil, as it embarks on hosting the world’s top athletes for the Olympic Games. This may have sounded like a great idea back in 2009 when Brazil won the right to host the Olympics. Then Brazil was    the new kid on the block whom everyone wanted to be friends with.” ’Fast forward six years and money is in fact very tight, the initial budget of $13 billion that the government put aside to fund the Olympic dream is set to be ; however, there is talk that the games will probably run over budget. In an unprecedented move, Panasonic, one of the major sponsors of the Rio 2016 Olympics, has actually offered financial aid to help pay for the opening and closing ceremonies.’ ’Despite this, Olympic officials are putting on a brave face, with AP quoting Christophe Dubi, the Olympic Games executive director: ”No one is saying that the Olympic experience will be affected. On the contrary, Rio will be magic.” But one must ask: At what cost?’ ’More than 1 million citizens took to the streets to protest the lack of public funds given to essential services like community infrastructure, hospitals, and education during the buildup to the 2014 World Cup. It is likely that many Brazilians will take to the streets again, frustrated at the state of affairs and possibly furious at the stratospherically disproportionate funding President Dilma Rousseff is again allocating to an international sporting event.’ ’These games are increasingly being seen as an unnecessary burden for an emerging economy that is already short on cash.’ ’These problems for Brazil have not come out of nowhere. We can locate three major reasons that the largest economy in South America is facing problems. First, there has been a trend in falling commodity prices. Iron ore makes up   —   with an export value of $33. 4 billion in 2013  —   with soybeans coming up a distant second at 9% and crude petroleum at 5. 3%.’ ”Second, it does not help that Brazil’s largest export partner for iron ore is China (48%) which equates to $16 billion in exports. These values have been and are predicted to slow down dramatically as China slows down its investments in infrastructure. An   on a once stable trade partner such as China when times were good is showing to be a real weakness in Brazil’s trade portfolio. With China and Brazil facing downturns, many are wondering whether ?” ’’ ”Lastly, and perhaps most important, Brazil suffers from a lack of policy reform. Recently we have seen frantic actions from Brazil’s leader to ensure her people and international investors that she has everything under control.” ’Rousseff last week reiterated her pledge to ”restoring fiscal balance, reducing inflation, and urgently resuming economic growth” during the   of her new leftist finance minister, Nelson Barbosa. This is probably a case of too little too late, especially considering the slew of corruption allegations the government is facing.’ ”Here is how things stand: Unemployment is at 7. 5% and inflation is set to hit 9%; the stock market has gone belly up; and S&P has downgraded Brazil’s credit rating to junk status. Said downgrade casts even more doubt on the government’s ability to pull the world’s   economy out of an imminent economic abyss.” ’Though there is very little the government can do to ensure   relief for average citizens, Brasilia can, however, come up with a   economic plan that aims to promote effective economic reform, make active contributions to curbing corruption, and make business practices more transparent.’ ’If done correctly, such efforts may  —   depending on the economic climate  —   attract investors once again. Performing this financial surgery will undoubtedly take time, planning, and consensus, but when the stakes are this high, slow and steady wins the race.’"

We shouldn’t be surprised that Apple may be hitting a roadblock with its car project,Business Insider,Matthew DeBord,2016-01-26,"’’ ’Reports are surfacing that   —     ”Project Titan”  —   and that the executive in charge of the effort has left the tech giant.’ ”I don’t think we should be surprised that the Apple Car is in trouble, if in fact it is  —   these are just reports, after all, and the real story could be something different.” ’The whole way Apple has gone about developing its foray into mobility has been, in a word, weird.’ ’For example, if you figured that Apple was hiring aggressively to bulk up its car team ahead of taking on Tesla, Google, and the traditional auto industry, then the news that the tech giant had  last year should have struck you as confusing.’ ”Betts joined Chrysler in 2007, brought on by   Robert Nardelli, who is now generally regarded as if not exactly responsible for Chrysler’s slide into a government bailout and bankruptcy in 2009, then at least for lacking a meaningful vision for the company under its ownership by   firm Cerberus. Prior to Chrysler, Betts was at Nissan.” ” after the automaker, never known for the quality of its cars and trucks relative to its peers, was clobbered by Consumer Reports, with numerous Chrysler, Dodge, and Jeep vehicles finishing well down the publication’s reliability list. At the time, Betts said he was pursuing other interests, but the speculation was that Fiat Chrysler’s Fiat 500, relatively newly arrived in the US, was considered such a reliability disgrace by Consumer Reports that Fiat Chrysler boss Sergio Marchionne was calling for a head.” ”Although there’s been buzz around Apple’s hiring of folks who have experience with battery development, electric propulsion, and hybrid drivetrains  —   not to mention some chatter about a talent war between Apple and Tesla  —   Apple has yet to bring on a single executive with either a significant   background or a truly     background.” ’By which I mean someone who has at least supervised the development of an important vehicle, or who has held a car job that parallels some of the bigger roles at Apple.’ ”Mostly, Apple is bringing on relatively obscure people. Betts is something of an exception because he’s distinguished, frankly, by not delivering quality products at Chrysler, although he did have a decent track record  .” ”This contrasts with Google’s hire of ” ’’ ’But maybe Apple doesn’’t want people coming in with baggage. For example, Tony Posawatz left his CEO gig at Fisker Automotive, a bankrupt Tesla competitor, and moved into a role with an ”EV advocacy group,” . Prior to Fisker, Posawatz was a longtime General Motors executive who led the development of the Chevrolet Volt   car  —   one of the few   vehicles that can give Tesla’’s cars a run for their money. He knows how to run an   program.’ ’Perhaps he’’s talked with Apple. But my point is that auto executives at that level aren’’t currently on the Apple ”Project Titan” roster. Worst case, this means that Apple isn’’t really all that serious about cars and is simply maintaining an exotic side project to avoid being outrun by Google, which has been developing a driverless car for years, and Tesla, which consistently presents itself as a tech company as much as a car company.’ ’’ ”It’s of course tempting to say that Apple needs to make a big, showy hire to prove that it truly wants to disrupt the auto industry  —   and that temptation could be exactly what Apple wants to avoid. Sure, Apple hired ” ”I have the sneaking sense that Apple is really interested in making manageable hires in the   space, so the Apple leaders who’ve expressed opinions about cars won’t have to be told that they would be nuts to pursue this or that strategy.” ”One extremely difficult call on that front would be to inform Apple that electric cars aren’t actually gaining much ground with consumers, Tesla notwithstanding. It’s widely assumed that if Apple is planning to build a car, then that car must be electric. But all the carmakers currently selling EVs see them as a virtuous, largely experimental sideline. In the US market at the moment, big trucks and SUVs are where the action is at, even if GM made a splash at the recent Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas with its Bolt EV, now heading for production.” ”Apple, however, can’t avoid building an electric car, even if the market doesn’t want one. Would you buy an Apple Car that you need to gas up with, you know, gasoline? Would you buy a diesel Apple Car?” ’’ ”Apple’s legendary secretiveness is an asset here. No one expects to get any clarity on the car project, so it’s all just thrilling free media for Cupertino as everyone ponders what the people who gave us the iPhone would do if they tackled the challenge of mobility.” ”That said, there really isn’t a mobility challenge. Apple designer Jony Ive may dislike modern cars  —   and if reports are accurate, be displeased with what he’s seen so far of the Apple Car project  —   but the bottom line is that most people can get exactly what they want when it comes to personal transportation.” ”The globe’s automakers do a fairly good job of providing abundant choice  —   far more than what people can get when it comes to smartphones and laptops, all of which essentially do the same thing. If I have less then $20, 000 to spend, I can buy a Toyota Prius and have a perfectly good mode of affordable, reliable, environmentally friendly transportation. If I have more than a million, I can buy a Ferrari LaFerrari and go from   in a claimed 2. 6 seconds and feel like an astronaut being blasted into space.” ’’ ’The question then becomes: Is there anything here to disrupt?’ ”If you assume that the world is moving inexorably toward autonomous fleets of networked cars that drive themselves, then yes. But Google is already way ahead of Apple with this theory. Tesla has shown that there’s a limited market for   luxury cars. But that’s not really a massive disruption, just a different choice.” ”And even if Apple makes a car, who would it be sold to? If you’re on your fifth BMW   and have considered and rejected the Model S for whatever reason, why would you take the leap on an Apple Car? This is the buyer Apple needs to capture, if it hopes to mimic its device profit margins with a car. Otherwise, Apple is doing fleet sales, a   business. Fleet sales, it should be noted, to fleets of driverless cars that don’t yet exist.” ”Bottom line: Apple has never done anything resembling a car before, so we should expect there to be some extremely high hurdles for the company to overcome. But Apple hasn’t made the moves so far with the project that would fill anyone with confidence that the Apple Car will be a huge success.”"
Meet Twitter’s new product chief: Jack Dorsey,Business Insider,Alexei Oreskovic,2016-01-26,"’’ ”If you’ve been wondering who will replace Twitter’s departing head of product, Kevin Weil, now you have your answer.” ’Nobody.’ ’Or, put another way, Jack Dorsey.’ ”Twitter revealed on Monday that the company will not appoint a direct successor to Weil, one of the  the company. Weil has overseen Twitter’s product since October 2014, a period during which the company’s user growth has basically ground to a halt.” ’Twitter said it was not hiring a new head of product, confirming a report first chronicled . And in a  Dorsey noted that the   group will now fall under Chief Technology Officer Adam Messinger, as will the engineering group.’ ’The move will unite the product and engineering teams, which might help Twitter move faster. But Messinger has a lot of other stuff on his plate, and according to The WSJ, is known for his expertise in   engineering infrastructure, rather than   vision.’ ’That would seem to leave Twitter at something of a disadvantage in exactly the part of its business that needs the most help.’ ’Fortunately, Twitter already has a famous   guru on staff.’ ’Dorsey was one of the creators of Twitter. He also created Square, the   company that popularized the   swipers used by every coffee shop and food truck.’ ”One of the main rationales for Dorsey’s return to Twitter as CEO was that he would be able to inject the bold product innovation that has been so sorely lacking at the company. And as a company founder, the thinking went, he would also have the moral authority to execute fundamental changes to the core product, whether that be abandoning the   limit, the time line’s   order, or something bigger.” ”In other words, there’s no need for a   boss anymore, since that’s basically Dorsey’s strength. In fact, having a dedicated    boss might create more internal confusion and problems, given that Dorsey is really the company’s product person.” ”Dorsey has his hands full, as he’s also the CEO of Square. That doesn’t leave him with as much time to focus on the product as someone doing that as their only job.” ’So Twitter is taking a gamble by putting all its product chips on the very thinly stretched Dorsey. But that die was already the cast when Twitter hired a CEO that had another   job.’"

Anderson’s office said it could not provide details until the documents charging Daleiden and Merritt were formally made public, which was expected later Monday.” ’”We were called upon to investigate allegations of criminal conduct by   Gulf Coast,” Anderson’’s statement said. ”As I stated at the outset of this investigation, we must go where the evidence leads us. ”’ ’The   Center for Medical Progress has released several covertly shot videos of  officials discussing the handling of fetal tissue from abortions.

Greg Abbott has called footage from the   clinic in Houston ”repulsive and unconscionable.” It showed people pretending to be from a company that procures fetal tissue for research touring the facility. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton also opened his own investigation into the videos.’ ’Abbott said the indictments will not impact the state’’s investigation, adding that Texas will ”continue to protect life. ”’ ’  officials swiftly hailed the indictment as just.’ ’”This is absolutely great news because it is a demonstration of what   has said from the very beginning: We follow every law and regulation and these   activists broke multiple laws to try and spread lies,” said spokeswoman Rochelle Tafolla of   Gulf Coast.’ ’The videos provoked an outcry from the   movement, and prompted numerous investigations of  by   committees in Congress and by   state governments.

She also said   believed the video would be manipulated.’ ”Earlier this month,   sued the center in a California federal court, alleging extensive criminal misconduct.

The iPhone and services like the App Store, Touch ID, Apple Pay, and Apple Music are so tightly linked, they’re . ” ’And so, by making their own tablets, Microsoft and Google both hoped to show the manufacturers of Windows and Android devices, respectively, what was possible when hardware and software worked together in perfect concert. ’ ”In practice, though, it’s been a mixed bag. When the devices work, they work great. But they can’t match an Apple iPad or Apple MacBook for reliability and   performance  —   something that matters much more to your average user than being on the cutting edge. ” ”The inescapable conclusion is that Apple’s lead doesn’t just come from its megamaniacal control. Maybe Apple’s focus on the user experience above all else is much harder than it looks. And Microsoft and Google are figuring that out the hard way.”"

It appeared the doctor may be more worried about addiction or diversion of the pills onto the black market if the patient was black and if the patient is white, they’’re overprescribing.” ’ ”While it’s impossible to know doctors’ reasons for prescribing certain medications  —   and individual doctors of course vary significantly in their background and world view  —   studies have shown that some doctors are less likely to prescribe opioid painkillers to black patients, while other research has suggested that black patients may be less likely to report serious pain.” ’A  in The American Journal of Public Health found that opioid painkillers were far less likely to be prescribed to black patients than to whites for migraines or back pain. And a  from the journal Pediatrics found that black patients were much less likely than white patients to be prescribed those painkillers for abdominal pain.’ ’ from the journal Clinical Orthopedics and Related Research noted that some black patients may underreport the severity of their pain.

In other words, warm air absorbs moisture, which is why hand dryers are (mostly) effective.’ ’This winter, waters off the US East Coast have been   —   about 5 to 6 degrees warmer than average, . This, along with a warmer Gulf Stream, adds more moisture to the air. Combine all that extra moisture with cold air, and you get a recipe for lots of snow. This warming can be linked in part to climate change.’ ’”There is   science that now suggests that climate change will lead to more of these intense,   Nor’easters, for precisely the reason we’re seeing this massive storm  —   unusually warm Atlantic ocean surface temperatures,” Penn State University climate scientist Michael Mann .’ ’Of course, with global warming comes the melting of polar ice caps and sea level rise. And the Northeast has seen some of the biggest rises. As Slate reports, waters in Lewes, Delaware, have risen by  over the past century. And higher seas  during major storms like Hurricane Sandy or Jonas.’ ”Climate change isn’t the only factor that spawned this weekend’s massive blizzard. But if current trends continue, it’s safe to say we can probably expect more of these snowpocalypse storms down the road.”"

Yet he hasn’t played since the   season, and at 40, there would be quite an adjustment period needed for him to give a team valuable minutes.” ”What’s strange, however, is that Miami seems so bent on signing Allen. The Heat aren’t a young team built around several notable veterans, including their stars, Dwyane Wade (34) and Chris Bosh (31). Whereas most teams turn to the   to give tryouts to young, hungry players, it’s odd that the Heat continue to knock on Allen’s door.” ”Based on Skolnick’s report and Allen’s decision not to play last year, it seems the Heat and the rest of the NBA have little chance of signing him.”"

Big investors are bailing out of stocks,Business Insider,,2016-01-27,"’Stocks can’t seem to rally for more than two days in a row before getting hammered down again, punishing   with relentless regularity for doing what had worked flawlessly for years.’ ’Today’s swoon  —   the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq dropped 1. 6% the Dow 1. 3%  —   put an end to the   rally that started midday Wednesday, when the S&P 500 bounced off 1, 812 and then rose 5. 3% by late Friday. Draghi had given the buy signal.’ ’“By the end of the week, weary investors had returned to an old habit: looking to central banks for solace,” wrote  Global Chief Investment Strategist Russ Koesterich on Monday morning, before it all fell apart again.’ ’But despite the vague promises embedded in   it didn’t last long. Overall, it was a puny rally compared to the brutal   that had started at the end of December. The S&P 500, at 1, 877, is now back exactly where it had been on March 10, 2014. Despite all the drama and volatility, it has gone nowhere in nearly two years  —   not counting anguish, fees, and taxes.’ ’Large institutional investors are starting to figure this out, too. And they’re planning to bail out of this cursed market.’ ’BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, polled 174 of its largest institutional clients, including corporate pension funds (34%) public pension funds (25%) insurers (25%) endowments and foundations (7%) investment managers (6%) official institutions (1%) and others (4%).

Only 18% of these institutional investors plan to increase their allocation to equities, while 33% plan to cut their allocation, for a net 15% reduction, globally. In the US and Canada, the feelings are much stronger: 50% plan to cut their stock portfolios.’ ’Sell, sell, sell. But what are they going to buy? Not bonds.’ ’These folks are also lightening up on bonds: 24% plan to increase their fixed income portfolios, while 30% plan to cut them. And the remaining fixed income portfolios are getting riskier, with funds shifting from core allocations to private credit, securitized assets (collateralized loan obligations and the like) and US leveraged loans (which helped fund the now collapsing US energy companies).’ ’With reductions in equities and bonds, what are they going to buy?’ ’’ ’“  illiquid strategies,” that’s where asset allocations are heading. In order of magnitude of the shift: private credit (“over half” plan to increase their portfolios) real assets (53% increase v. 4% decrease) real estate (47% increase v. 9% decrease) and private equity (39% increase v. 9% decrease).’ ’The report offered two reasons why investors are fleeing into illiquid assets: to earn the higher return premia that illiquid assets offer, and most prominently, to escape the volatility of stocks and bonds.’ ’Illiquid assets  —   because they aren’t regularly traded, there is no pricing data  —   have an advantage over stocks and bonds for institutional investors in these trying times: their losses don’t have to be booked every time a statement goes out. Losses aren’t known, and certainly aren’t disclosed, until years down the road.’ ’If the stock and bond markets crash, if junk bonds completely collapse, so be it. The values of these illiquid assets will remain stable, and the pension fund managers can sleep at night. This is not a strategy to reduce risk  —   some of these illiquid assets are very risky. It’s a strategy to reduce the requirement to book losses when asset prices head south.’ ’It’s a sign that institutional investors have soured on stocks and their potential trajectory. No one minds being required to book gains. It’s the part about booking losses that is painful  —   and that these folks are trying to avoid.’ ’These changes in asset allocation away from stocks will have a special effect on the market. When large institutional investors unload stocks en masse, however gradually, they’re trying to do this in order to not crush the market on their own. It’s going to get a lot uglier out there.’ ’Turns out this stock market faces a host of issues  —   on the junk bond side.’"

The iPhone 6 met   customer demand for a phone with a larger screen. Apple looked at Samsung’s success selling phones with larger screens, wisely cast aside Steve Jobs’ former ruling that the iPhone’s   screen was perfect, and boom  —   sales took off.” ”Where’s the unmet demand this time? What are people buying from competitors that Apple doesn’t offer?” ’This is the maturity of the smartphone market. When everybody who can afford a smartphone has one, nobody  —   not even Apple  —   will be able to speed up the natural replacement cycle of every two or three years.’ ’By the way, Mac sales also went negative for the first time since  :’ ’’ ”The Apple Watch is not the hit Apple needed. Apple didn’t release sales figures for it, except to say that December was its best quarter ever, but the anecdotal evidence is pretty overwhelming.

Until Apple releases sales figures, we won’t know.” ’Same thing with Apple TV: nice product, slowly growing sales every quarter, but not particularly material to earnings. It’’s lumped with the Watch and Beats headphones in the ”Other” category, which delivered $4. 3 billion in revenue out of Apple’’s $75. 9 billion in total.’ ”So what’s the next big thing? Cook hinted that cloud services might be the area of investment for Apple: ” ” which could offer smaller bundles of TV channels that people really want for a cheaper price than cable TV. But Apple needs to finish signing the necessary content deals, or maybe . The future of TV may be coming, and Apple may deliver it, but it’s not here yet.” ”Plus, Apple’s record with services is bad. Apple Maps still isn’t as good as Google Maps. Siri works right about half the time. Also, iCloud is confoundingly frustrating  —   I just had a problem updating my iPhone software because my iCloud storage was full to capacity and they wanted me to buy more. I wasn’t even aware I’d turned it on. And Apple Music is a .” ”So I’m not convinced that Apple has the chops to deliver a   online service  —   it never has. Great hardware, occasionally brilliant software, an unparalleled retail experience. But online services? Not so much.” ’’ ”Don’t get me wrong: Apple is not in trouble. It just  of any company in history. It has more than $200 billion in cash and investments sitting on its balance sheet. More than  right now, and Apple can theoretically sell services and downloads to all of them. It will continue to iterate on its existing hit products, particularly the iPhone, to keep people upgrading every two or three releases.” ”But for a company to keep growing at the rate Apple grew during the last decade, it can’t just keep reworking the same old classics.

As such, there is no authoritative list of   countries.’ ’Still, we took a look at the countries with the  based on Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) per capita in international dollars, as a proxy for a list of   countries.

"Snow shovels, plowing, and road salt could soon become a thing of the past",Business Insider,,2016-01-27,"’’ ’For commuters negotiating   conditions, take heart: electric   concrete may be coming to a city near you. ’ ’Dr. Chris Tuan, a professor of civil engineering at the University of   and his team of researchers have developed a concrete mixture prototype that melts away falling snow and ice by conducting electricity.  ’ ’Steel rods beneath the concrete’s surface connect to electrodes, which connect to a   AC power source.’ ’Carbon byproducts from coal mining and steel shavings from industrial waste make up only 20 percent of the otherwise typical concrete mixture, but the conductivity is strong enough to clear the surface. ’ ’’ ’  concrete has been researched for decades. Tuan is enthusiastice about his new prototype, however, because it reduces costs by 60 percent compared to earlier trials. ’ ’Still, it’s not cheap: Tuan’s concrete runs $300 per cubic yard, compared to $120 per cubic yard of regular concrete. ’ ’But the typical salt and   chemicals used on streets can corrode concrete and lead to potholes. Tuan said this makes his conductive concrete an even more attractive option, with a greater upfront price tag offsetting later maintenance and operating costs. ’ ’“Bridges always freeze up first, because they’re exposed to the elements on top and bottom,” Tuan told UNL Today. “It’s not   to build entire roadways using conducive concrete, but you can use it at certain locations where you always get ice or have potholes. ” ’ ’In 2003, Tuan installed a conductive concrete system on the  He said that it cost $250 to   the bridge during a   storm, far less than the usual costs of plowing, chemicals and subsequent road damage.’ ’“Statistics indicate that  are directly related to weather conditions,” Tuan explains in his 2008 analysis of the bridge study. “This percentage alone represents thousands of human injuries and deaths and millions of dollars in property damage annually   …     The conductive concrete deicing technology is readily available for implementation at   areas such as bridge overpasses, exit ramps, airport runways, street intersections, sidewalks and driveways. ” ’ ’And along with bridges, Tuan sees serious potential for his invention at airports. ’ ’Tuan and his team of researchers are in a test phase with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) through March. And if the FAA is satisfied with the results of Tuan’s electric concrete, they will move on to test the product at a major airport. ’ ’Tuan said he is surprised to hear the FAA isn’t as worried about the runways  —   they are hoping the concrete is effective on the tarmacs. ’ ’“What they need is the tarmac around the gated areas cleared, because they have so many carts to unload  —   luggage service, food service, trash service, fuel service  —   that all need to get into those areas,” Tuan explains to UNL Today. “They said that if we can heat that kind of tarmac, then there would be (far fewer)   delays. . ” ’ ’As for energy usage, Tuan argues that his product actually helps the environment. ’ ’His system takes about 13 watts of energy per square foot, far less than the typical   incandescent light bulb. And in the future, Tuan said he wants to develop sensors that would allow the concrete to turn on only during a storm, and then off when they are no longer needed. ’ ’Conductive concrete can alleviate environmental damage by reducing the amount of salt and chemicals dispersed on roads and sidewalks after storms. Melting snow and ice carries  and nearby soils, which in turn can slow plant growth and attract animals into dangerous roadways.   ’ ’And Tuan takes his work home with him: ten years ago, he installed one of his first pilot systems in the patio of his Nebraskan backyard. ’"

During that contest, Santorum narrowly edged out former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney (R) in Iowa and won a number of states’ primaries and caucuses.” ’But this time around, Santorum has struggled to gain traction or media attention against his   and   rivals.’ ’”This is what the media has been doing over the past year in trying to segregate and take Iowans out of the process,” Santorum said, his voice rising. ”What Iowans deserve is to hear from every candidate on an equal footing! Had they applied the same rules four years ago, I would have been in the ’’undercard debate. ’’”’ ’Santorum, his voice continuing to boom, urged voters to back him over Trump, the Republican   who is boycotting the main event.’ ’”Ladies and gentlemen, you have a chance on Monday to put the record straight about who you want  —   not who will entertain you  —   but who will fight for what you believe!” he said.’ ’”The entire   to this debate was talking about whether Donald Trump was going to show up to the next debate. The people of Iowa  —   who I know pretty darn well  —   care about issues,” he added.’ ”Fox anchor Bill Hemmer, one of the two moderators of the undercard debate, pointed out that Santorum is planning to go to the charity fundraiser Trump is hosting as part of the  ’s debate boycott.” ’”Are you laying the groundwork for maybe your future, perhaps an endorsement of Mr. Trump?” Hemmer asked.’ ”Santorum said he simply didn’t have anything else to do later that night, so he decided he would help Trump raise money for veterans.”"

The leaked email that ex-Mizzou President Tim Wolfe sent to friends is shockingly tone-deaf,Business Insider,Abby Jackson,2016-01-29,"’  President Tim Wolfe wrote an  about his departure that recently leaked online. In it, he tried to argue that he is not an incompetent leader. But after reading his email, I actually concluded the opposite.’ ’Wolfe resigned as president in November after students accused him of being an ineffectual leader .’ ’On Wednesday,  posted the email he sent to an undisclosed list of ”a select few friends. ”’ ’His allegations of administrative malfeasance reads like   and a possible vendetta against  .’ ’In his email, he launched an attack on a former colleague he hired, the governing board of the university, members of the football team, and their coach who announced his resignation after a cancer diagnosis.’ ’Wolfe contends he was surrounded by   individuals who orchestrated the events on campus to deflect criticism from their own failed administrative positions.’ ”He hits out most pointedly at former university chancellor, R. Bowen Loftin, who also resigned from his position in November. Wolfe says Loftin’s job was on the line shortly before the protests on campus but Loftin used the Concerned Student 1950   protest group to shift focus onto Wolfe.” ’Wolfe also attacks Mizzou’’s board of curators, the governing body at the school. He accuses the board of being corrupt, saying ”a few of the members of the board of curators consistently called subordinate staff and faculty members to dig up dirt and use their Curator role to further personal agendas. ”’ ’Later, when he writes he made a mistake in hiring Loftin, his ”I never should’’ve hired him” argument comes off as petulant and vindictive.’ ’His accusations that administrators orchestrated events on campus belittles the cause that thousands of Missouri students fought for and achieved last fall.’ ’’ ”Wolfe’s comments would almost certainly infuriate the students who had hate speech hurled at them, who were bumped by a convertible transporting Wolfe while they were trying to peacefully protest, or Jonathan Butler, an   graduate student who .” ”Wolfe’s admonishment of the Missouri football program is particularly vexing. He takes aim at the group of black football players at Missouri who pledged not to participate in football activities until Wolfe was removed from office.” ’He says the team’’s actions will cost the school millions in lost tuition and that ”the end result could be a financial catastrophe for our university. ”’ ’Wolfe squarely places the specter of a financial catastrophe on the shoulders of a team of   to    while neglecting to mention the administrators who are paid six figures to avoid such an incident.’ ’In his email, Wolfe also lectures football coach Gary Pinkel on missing out on an important opportunity to teach his players a valuable life lesson.’ ’He leaves it to the reader to figure out just what lesson that is. Perhaps that   who receive no financial compensation in return for bringing in millions of dollars for the school actually have a tremendous amount of bargaining capital. Or that nonviolent protest has value in a civil society.’ ”We’ll have to wait for a response by Wolfe for an answer to that question.” ”He comes across as bitter when he complains his resignation package  —   which came after intense pressure to step down  —   isn’t commensurate with that of some of his colleagues.” ”He specifically complains about being underpaid compared to Pinkel, who he says will receive $350, 000 a year for three years after his resignation. But Wolfe is hardly in the same boat as the coach, especially since Pinkel resigned because he was diagnosed with  ’s lymphoma and wants to spend his remaining years with family and friends.” ”Wolfe’s argument comes across as clumsy and distasteful.” ”What’s most telling to me is that Wolfe never explains his own part in the controversy that took over Mizzou.” ’Racial tensions on the Columbia, Missouri, campus started when Payton Head, president of the Missouri Students Association, was abused with racial epithets while walking on campus in the beginning of September.’ ”Tensions accelerated when another group of students was targeted with hate speech in October. Less than a week later, students staged a protest during Missouri’s homecoming parade. Members of a protest group called Concerned Student 1950 interrupted the parade and stood in front of a red convertible driving Wolfe. The stopped car moved back and forth, revving its engine and eventually bumped into a student.” ”The events on Missouri’s campus spurred protests at colleges around the nation, allowing students to speak up for the institutional racism they say is apparent on their own campuses.” ”Wolfe’s position comes across as skeptical that there was ever truly an issue that needed correcting, or at least addressing, under his tenure as president. This is probably his biggest misstep.” ’Leadership is not just about the ability to manage correctly but the ability to inspire those around you. As much as it is about the ”bottom line,” it’’s about public perception and your instincts to address problems before they become public relations nightmares.’ ”For those who think it’s unfair for Wolfe’s job to hinge, in part, on his public perception, tell that to CEOs who regularly lose their jobs for just that.”"
