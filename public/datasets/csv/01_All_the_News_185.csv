Trump Insists Mexico Will Pay for Wall After U.S. Begins the Work - The New York Times,New York Times,Michael D. Shear and Emmarie Huetteman,2017-01-07,"WASHINGTON  —   As congressional Republicans on Friday discussed quickly moving ahead with plans for a southern border wall using money included in this year’s spending bills,   Donald J. Trump insisted that Mexico would ultimately pay for its construction. “We’re going to get reimbursed,” Mr. Trump said during a brief telephone interview. “But I don’t want to wait that long. But you start, and then you get reimbursed. ” The congressional Republicans’ talk led to speculation that Mr. Trump was retreating on his campaign promise to make Mexico pay for the wall. Mr. Trump insisted he is not. Republicans have balked at increases in domestic spending during the Obama administration and are unlikely to enthusiastically rally behind a proposal that could require billions of taxpayer dollars. Building a wall to keep out unauthorized immigrants could also face intense opposition from a bipartisan coalition in Congress that argues that a vast barrier along the border would be ineffective in stopping people who are determined to enter the country illegally and would represent a symbolic affront to the idea that the United States is a welcoming country that embraces immigration. In the interview, Mr. Trump vowed that Mexico would ultimately reimburse the United States. He said that payment would most likely emerge from his efforts to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement with the Mexican government. “It’s going to be part of everything,” Mr. Trump said of the cost of building the wall. “We are going to be making a much better deal. It’s a deal that never should have been signed. ” But he said that the trade negotiations would take time and that he supported the idea of using taxpayer money to begin construction of the border wall “in order to speed up the process. ” The full cost of a wall as described by Mr. Trump could be enormous. Attaching such a charged issue to annual, mandatory government funding measures could instigate a risky political fight. Those who want to block money for the wall by holding up the bills could find themselves accused of shutting down the government. The Government Accountability Office has estimated it could cost $6. 5 million per mile to build a   fence, with an additional $4. 2 million per mile for roads and more fencing, according to congressional officials. Those estimates do not include maintenance of the fence along the nearly   border with Mexico. “The chairman and the committee have no interest in threatening a shutdown,” said Jennifer Hing, a spokeswoman for the House Appropriations Committee, referring to Representative Rodney Frelinghuysen, Republican of New Jersey and the committee’s new chairman. If funding for the border wall is included in spending bills this spring, it would provide money to begin construction on a barrier that was authorized by legislation passed in 2006, but was never completed. Ms. Hing said neither Mr. Trump’s transition team nor Republican leaders had asked for funding to build a wall on the Mexican border. “If and when a proposal is received, we will take a careful look at it,” she said in an email on Friday. At a rally in August in Phoenix, hours after meeting with President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico, Mr. Trump vowed that America’s southern neighbor would bear the financial burden of securing the border. “Mexico will pay for the wall, believe me  —   100 percent  —   they don’t know it yet, but they will pay for the wall,” Mr. Trump said. “They’re great people, and great leaders, but they will pay for the wall. ” In a Twitter post on Friday, Mr. Trump mocked news reports about the possible taxpayer funding of the border barrier, suggesting that Mexico would be forced to reimburse the American government for any costs incurred in building the wall. “The dishonest media does not report that any money spent on building the Great Wall (for sake of speed) will be paid back by Mexico later!” he wrote early Friday. Vicente Fox, who was Mexico’s president from 2000 until 2006, responded to Mr. Trump’s Twitter message with a barrage of outraged posts that became an internet talking point on their own. In one of them, he made reference to the intelligence agency reports about Russian meddling in the 2016 election. “Sr Trump, the intelligence report is devastating,” Mr. Fox said. “Losing election by more than 3M votes and in addition this. Are you a legitimate president?” Representative Chris Collins, Republican of New York and one of Mr. Trump’s liaisons on Capitol Hill, said on Friday morning that members of his party in Congress were eager to get moving on construction of a border wall, even if that meant using taxpayer money to finance it. In an appearance on the CNN program “New Day,” Mr. Collins said it should come as no surprise to anyone that the United States government would have to pay for building the wall. “Of course, we have to pay the bills,” he said. “We’re building the wall. ” As a candidate, Mr. Trump’s promise to build a wall to keep out immigrants from Mexico was one of his most powerful speaking points. He often used it at rallies to whip up his supporters and bolster his argument that illegal immigration was damaging the United States. His repeated pledge to make Mexico pay was in part a way to rebut one of the central criticisms of a border wall  —   that its cost could run into the many billions of dollars. Democrats slammed the reports that Mr. Trump would ask Congress to fund the project. “If President Trump asks Congress to approve taxpayer dollars to build a wall, which he has always said would not be paid for by U. S. taxpayers, we will carefully review the request to determine if these taxpayer dollars would be better spent on building hospitals to care for our veterans, roads and bridges to help taxpayers get to work, and for N. I. H. to find cures for cancer,” Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, said in a statement. Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader, said she thought even Republicans might balk at spending what she said could be $14 billion on a wall. “I think that’s a heavy sell,” she said. “I think that’s a tough sell for them. ”"
Scientists Say the Clock of Aging May Be Reversible - The New York Times,New York Times,Nicholas Wade,2017-04-14,"At the Salk Institute in La Jolla, Calif. scientists are trying to get time to run backward. Biological time, that is. In the first attempt to reverse aging by reprogramming the genome, they have rejuvenated the organs of mice and lengthened their life spans by 30 percent. The technique, which requires genetic engineering, cannot be applied directly to people, but the achievement points toward better understanding of human aging and the possibility of rejuvenating human tissues by other means. The Salk team’s discovery, reported in the Thursday issue of the journal Cell, is “novel and exciting,” said Jan Vijg, an expert on aging at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York. Leonard Guarente, who studies the biology of aging at M. I. T. said, “This is huge,” citing the novelty of the finding and the opportunity it creates to slow down, if not reverse, aging. “It’s a pretty remarkable finding, and if it holds up it could be quite important in the history of aging research,” Dr. Guarente said. The finding is based on the heterodox idea that aging is not irreversible and that an animal’s biological clock can in principle be wound back to a more youthful state. The aging process is clocklike in the sense that a steady accumulation of changes eventually degrades the efficiency of the body’s cells. In one of the deepest mysteries of biology, the clock’s hands are always set back to zero at conception: However old the parents and their reproductive cells, a fertilized egg is free of all marks of age. Ten years ago, the Japanese biologist Shinya Yamanaka amazed researchers by identifying four critical genes that reset the clock of the fertilized egg. The four genes are so powerful that they will reprogram even the genome of skin or intestinal cells back to the embryonic state. Dr. Yamanaka’s method is now routinely used to change adult tissue cells into cells very similar to the embryonic stem cells produced in the first few divisions of a fertilized egg. Scientists next began to wonder if the four Yamanaka genes could be applied not just to cells in glassware but to a whole animal. The results were disastrous. As two groups of researchers reported in 2013 and 2014, the animals all died, some because their adult tissue cells had lost their identity and others from cancer. Embryonic cells are primed for rapid growth, which easily becomes uncontrolled. But at the Salk Institute, Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte had been contemplating a different approach. He has long been interested in regeneration, the phenomenon in which certain animals, like lizards and fish, can regenerate lost tails or limbs. The cells near the lost appendage revert to a stage midway between an embryonic cell, which is open to all fates, and an adult cell, which is committed to being a particular type of cell, before rebuilding the missing limb. This partial reprogramming suggested to him that reprogramming is a stepwise process, and that a small dose of the Yamanaka factors might rejuvenate cells without the total reprogramming that converts cells to the embryonic state. With Alejandro Ocampo and other Salk researchers, Dr. Izpisua Belmonte has spent five years devising ways to deliver a nonlethal dose of Yamanaka factors to mice. The solution his team developed was to genetically engineer mice with extra copies of the four Yamanaka genes, and to have the genes activated only when the mice received a certain drug in their drinking water, applied just two days a week. The Salk team worked first with mice that age prematurely, so as to get quick results. “What we saw is that the animal has fewer signs of aging, healthier organs, and at the end of the experiment we could see they had lived 30 percent longer than control mice,” Dr. Izpisua Belmonte said. The team also saw improved organ health in normal mice but, because the mice are still living, could not yet say if longevity was extended. Dr. Izpisua Belmonte believes these beneficial effects have been obtained by resetting the clock of the aging process. The clock is created by the epigenome, the system of proteins that clads the cell’s DNA and controls which genes are active and which are suppressed. When an egg develops into a whole animal, the epigenome plays a critical role by letting a heart cell, say, activate just the genes specific to its role but switching off all the genes used by other types of cells. This process lets the embryo’s cells differentiate into all the various types of cells required by the adult body. The epigenome is also involved throughout life in maintaining each cell and letting it switch genes on and off as required for its housekeeping duties. The epigenome itself is controlled by agents that add or subtract chemical groups, known as marks, to its proteins. Only in the last few years have biologists come to realize that the state of the epigenome may be a major cause of aging. If the epigenome is damaged, perhaps by accumulating too many marks, the cell’s efficiency is degraded. Dr. Izpisua Belmonte sees the epigenome as being like a manuscript that is continually edited. “At the end of life there are many marks and it is difficult for the cell to read them,” he said. What the Yamanaka genes are doing in his mice, he believes, is eliminating the extra marks, thus reverting the cell to a more youthful state. The Salk biologists “do indeed provide what I believe to be the first evidence that partial reprogramming of the genome ameliorated symptoms of tissue degeneration and improved regenerative capacity,” Dr. Vijg said. But he cautioned the   mice used in the study might not be fully representative of ordinary aging. Dr. Guarente said it was more likely that the Yamanaka genes were not erasing the epigenomic marks directly, but rather were activating the genes which are responsible for the immense health and vitality of embryonic cells. This gene activation is a natural function of the Yamanaka factors. It is these embryonic   genes that are rejuvenating the tissues in the mice, Dr. Guarente suggested, and causing changes in the epigenome through their activity. Thomas A. Rando, an expert on stem cells and aging at Stanford, said that it should be possible in theory to uncouple the differentiation program and the aging process, and that “if that’s what’s happening, this is the first demonstration of that. ” Dr. Izpisua Belmonte said he was testing drugs to see if he could achieve the same rejuvenation as with the Yamanaka factors. The use of chemicals “will be more translatable to human therapies and clinical applications,” he said."
Why You Will Marry the Wrong Person - The New York Times,New York Times,Alain de Botton,2017-01-09,"IT’S one of the things we are most afraid might happen to us. We go to great lengths to avoid it. And yet we do it all the same: We marry the wrong person. Partly, it’s because we have a bewildering array of problems that emerge when we try to get close to others. We seem normal only to those who don’t know us very well. In a wiser, more   society than our own, a standard question on any early dinner date would be: “And how are you crazy?” Perhaps we have a latent tendency to get furious when someone disagrees with us or can relax only when we are working perhaps we’re tricky about intimacy after sex or clam up in response to humiliation. Nobody’s perfect. The problem is that before marriage, we rarely delve into our complexities. Whenever casual relationships threaten to reveal our flaws, we blame our partners and call it a day. As for our friends, they don’t care enough to do the hard work of enlightening us. One of the privileges of being on our own is therefore the sincere impression that we are really quite easy to live with. Our partners are no more  . Naturally, we make a stab at trying to understand them. We visit their families. We look at their photos, we meet their college friends. All this contributes to a sense that we’ve done our homework. We haven’t. Marriage ends up as a hopeful, generous, infinitely kind gamble taken by two people who don’t know yet who they are or who the other might be, binding themselves to a future they cannot conceive of and have carefully avoided investigating. For most of recorded history, people married for logical sorts of reasons: because her parcel of land adjoined yours, his family had a flourishing business, her father was the magistrate in town, there was a castle to keep up, or both sets of parents subscribed to the same interpretation of a holy text. And from such reasonable marriages, there flowed loneliness, infidelity, abuse, hardness of heart and screams heard through the nursery doors. The marriage of reason was not, in hindsight, reasonable at all it was often expedient,   snobbish and exploitative. That is why what has replaced it  —   the marriage of feeling  —   has largely been spared the need to account for itself. What matters in the marriage of feeling is that two people are drawn to each other by an overwhelming instinct and know in their hearts that it is right. Indeed, the more imprudent a marriage appears (perhaps it’s been only six months since they met one of them has no job or both are barely out of their teens) the safer it can feel. Recklessness is taken as a counterweight to all the errors of reason, that catalyst of misery, that accountant’s demand. The prestige of instinct is the traumatized reaction against too many centuries of unreasonable reason. But though we believe ourselves to be seeking happiness in marriage, it isn’t that simple. What we really seek is familiarity  —   which may well complicate any plans we might have had for happiness. We are looking to recreate, within our adult relationships, the feelings we knew so well in childhood. The love most of us will have tasted early on was often confused with other, more destructive dynamics: feelings of wanting to help an adult who was out of control, of being deprived of a parent’s warmth or scared of his anger, of not feeling secure enough to communicate our wishes. How logical, then, that we should as   find ourselves rejecting certain candidates for marriage not because they are wrong but because they are too right  —   too balanced, mature, understanding and reliable  —   given that in our hearts, such rightness feels foreign. We marry the wrong people because we don’t associate being loved with feeling happy. We make mistakes, too, because we are so lonely. No one can be in an optimal frame of mind to choose a partner when remaining single feels unbearable. We have to be wholly at peace with the prospect of many years of solitude in order to be appropriately picky otherwise, we risk loving no longer being single rather more than we love the partner who spared us that fate. Finally, we marry to make a nice feeling permanent. We imagine that marriage will help us to bottle the joy we felt when the thought of proposing first came to us: Perhaps we were in Venice, on the lagoon, in a motorboat, with the evening sun throwing glitter across the sea, chatting about aspects of our souls no one ever seemed to have grasped before, with the prospect of dinner in a risotto place a little later. We married to make such sensations permanent but failed to see that there was no solid connection between these feelings and the institution of marriage. Indeed, marriage tends decisively to move us onto another, very different and more administrative plane, which perhaps unfolds in a suburban house, with a long commute and maddening children who kill the passion from which they emerged. The only ingredient in common is the partner. And that might have been the wrong ingredient to bottle. The good news is that it doesn’t matter if we find we have married the wrong person. We mustn’t abandon him or her, only the founding Romantic idea upon which the Western understanding of marriage has been based the last 250 years: that a perfect being exists who can meet all our needs and satisfy our every yearning. We need to swap the Romantic view for a tragic (and at points comedic) awareness that every human will frustrate, anger, annoy, madden and disappoint us  —   and we will (without any malice) do the same to them. There can be no end to our sense of emptiness and incompleteness. But none of this is unusual or grounds for divorce. Choosing whom to commit ourselves to is merely a case of identifying which particular variety of suffering we would most like to sacrifice ourselves for. This philosophy of pessimism offers a solution to a lot of distress and agitation around marriage. It might sound odd, but pessimism relieves the excessive imaginative pressure that our romantic culture places upon marriage. The failure of one particular partner to save us from our grief and melancholy is not an argument against that person and no sign that a union deserves to fail or be upgraded. The person who is best suited to us is not the person who shares our every taste (he or she doesn’t exist) but the person who can negotiate differences in taste intelligently  —   the person who is good at disagreement. Rather than some notional idea of perfect complementarity, it is the capacity to tolerate differences with generosity that is the true marker of the “not overly wrong” person. Compatibility is an achievement of love it must not be its precondition. Romanticism has been unhelpful to us it is a harsh philosophy. It has made a lot of what we go through in marriage seem exceptional and appalling. We end up lonely and convinced that our union, with its imperfections, is not “normal. ” We should learn to accommodate ourselves to “wrongness,” striving always to adopt a more forgiving, humorous and kindly perspective on its multiple examples in ourselves and in our partners."
"When Killer and Victim’s Mother Meet, Paths From Grief, Fear and Guilt Emerge - The New York Times",New York Times,Timothy Williams,2017-01-07,"TOPEKA, Kan.  —   Timothy Shahid and Joshua Kalina met, went drinking, became friends and then had a falling out that lead to the murder of one of the young men, all in a matter of hours. The victim’s mother, her life suddenly a disordered jumble marked by panic attacks and nightmares, decided to seek out her son’s killer to try to understand what had prompted an act of violence so baffling that even the gunman was at a loss.  With the aid of a restorative justice program, which brings together victims and those who have caused them harm, the two ultimately met  —   each seeking a way out of grief, fear and guilt. Here’s a look at Timothy, Joshua and Joshua’s mother as she becomes involved in the program. (In this related article, read about a meeting between the parents of a college student and the man convicted in the   accident that killed their son.) “I probably broke my mom’s heart when I told her that,” Timothy, now 30, said. “The road I was leading, I knew I was going to end up in one of those two places. ” At 14, Timothy and some other boys robbed a pawnshop, and he spent two years in a juvenile facility. By age 16, he was “religiously” carrying a gun that he sometimes used. He did not elaborate. “Hanging out with a group of kids gave me hope,” said Timothy, who was tormented by his adoption, and the parents he never knew. “I didn’t think my biological mother loved me. ” At the time of the shooting, Timothy was working at a telemarketing center. He spent his free hours smoking pot and drinking at least a pint of Hennessy a day. He customized the black 2005 Nissan Altima with special wheel rims, and was methodical about keeping the car looking pristine. Joshua grew up in Topeka with his mother, Judi Bergquist, and was especially close to his older brother. He liked to play practical jokes on those close to him. “He was so funny,” his mother said. He had severe attention deficit disorder and graduated from an alternative high school. Problems with social anxiety prompted him to wear a St. Louis Cardinals baseball cap pulled low over his face. Ms. Bergquist said Joshua began hanging out with what she described as a “rougher” group of friends after graduating, so she sent him to Texas to live with her parents. He returned to Topeka about two years later and found work at a   service. But persistent money problems forced him to rely on his mother and grandmother. “The day he died, he called me in the late afternoon,” Ms. Bergquist said. “He was extremely upset because my mom had shut off his cellphone and he had a car payment to make. ” He’d screamed at her. A few hours later, she said Joshua drove slowly by her house but didn’t stop. It was the last time she saw him alive. Hours later, Timothy and Joshua met for the first time through a mutual friend. The two seemed to hit it off. “He didn’t come off as a person I couldn’t get along with. I was easy to get along with,” Timothy said. “I rode around with Josh in his car. ” But as the night of April 23, 2007, wore on, their easy conversation deteriorated into bickering, and the two argued loudly while drinking at a bar. “He said something about one of my friends, so I said something about one of his friends,” said Timothy, who called someone to pick him up. “We were going out the door at the same time, still arguing. I actually opened his car door and then I walk off. I just told him to get in the car. That’s when me and his friend, we’re arguing now . .. All I see was him pull out a weapon . .. I thought he had a gun. ” He fired eight times, and a friend of Timothy’s fired twice more before they fled, the police said. Joshua was left in the parking lot with four gunshot wounds in the chest, one in the left hip, two in the buttocks and three in the left hand. “My   was it was better him than me,” Timothy said. “I didn’t believe in fighting. I just pulled out my gun. I actually ran up to him when I shot him. I don’t blame alcohol. I knew what I was doing. I just saw something in his hand. ” Joshua was unarmed, police said Timothy’s accomplice was never arrested. During pretrial hearings, Timothy would see Ms. Bergquist in the courtroom, and at one court appearance, he taunted her. “I actually took her son’s photo, and held it up and turned around, and that’s when I laughed at her,” he said. Ms. Bergquist, suffering from memory loss and insomnia, panicked every time she saw a tall   man  —   the loose description of Timothy’s accomplice. “If I saw anybody with that vague description, I would just lose it,” she said. Finally, wanting to avoid a trial, Ms. Bergquist agreed to a plea deal in which Timothy would receive about 20 years. Timothy was impassive: “I didn’t care about life. ” “I knew that Timothy held the answers that I needed. I needed reassurance from Timothy that the other person was never going to bother me,” said Ms. Bergquist. “I needed to feel safe. At the same time, I needed to know if Timothy was working to change his life. I didn’t want this to happen to anyone else. ” The first step toward a meeting came after a prison official showed Timothy an article that Ms. Bergquist had written about Joshua. Ms. Bergquist also contacted Holly Chavez, the restorative justice coordinator at the Kansas Department of Corrections, and asked whether a    meeting would be possible. Timothy was also growing more introspective. He was reading the Bible as well as a book that included a passage that seemed written for him: “If you always do what you always did, you always get what you always got. ” The solitude of prison forced him to try to figure out who he was. “I had a lot of time,” he said. “You got to deal with a lot of stuff on your own. It made me go back and look at the things in my life. I became Christian. I understood forgiveness  —   that I took a life that I can never give back. ” What follows is a discussion of the reactions of Timothy and Ms. Bergquist as they worked with Ms. Chavez toward a    encounter. The excerpts, which are from separate interviews that took place after the meeting, capture the thinking of those involved.

Timothy, who killed Joshua Ms. Chavez Ms. Bergquist Timothy Ms. Bergquist Timothy Ms. Bergquist Timothy Ms. Bergquist Timothy Ms. Bergquist In April 2016, the two met again  —   this time at a victims’ awareness event at the prison in front of inmates. “She called me her friend,” Timothy said. “A woman forgiving her son’s killer and calling him her friend. And at the end, she got up and gave me a hug. You just don’t see that too often. ” (In this related article, Zachary Harrison struggles to understand why the parents of the man he killed want to meet him.) "
"After One-Child Policy, Outrage at China’s Offer to Remove IUDs - The New York Times",New York Times,Sui-Lee Wee,2017-01-09,"BEIJING  —   A few months after Lu Qiumei gave birth to her daughter in 2012, local officials visited her home and told her that she was required to be fitted with an intrauterine device. For more than three decades, this was national policy in China. The IUD was the government’s most important tool for limiting couples to one child, and almost all new mothers were required to get one. Ms. Lu, a former advertising executive, considered the demand invasive, insulting and potentially harmful to her health. Still, like hundreds of millions of Chinese women before her, she made an appointment with a state gynecologist and had one put in. Now, a year after abandoning the “ ” policy, the government is hoping to make it up to Ms. Lu and millions of women like her  —   by removing their IUDs, free of charge. But the offer, made without even a hint of an apology, has provoked incredulous outrage. “We shouldn’t even have had this in the first place, and now the government wants to use it as a form of state benefit for people,” Ms. Lu, 36, scoffed in a phone interview from her home in the eastern city of Linyi. “It’s like they are slapping themselves in the face. ” While IUDs elsewhere can often be removed with the tug of their strings in a doctor’s office, surgery is usually needed in China because most devices here are designed or altered to be more difficult to extract, some with shortened strings and others with no strings at all. But many Chinese women have chafed at the thought of the government’s getting involved, yet again, in their private lives. And for many mothers, the offer has come too late for them to consider having a second child. “It’s the equivalent of someone injuring you and then mending the wound,” said Zhang Xintian, 25, who watched her mother go into surgery two years ago in the eastern province of Zhejiang to remove the IUD she had worn for more than two decades. In China, women often have the same IUD from soon after childbirth until menopause while popular IUDs in the United States are typically deemed effective for up to 10 years, those used in China offer birth control for much longer. China began demanding that women be fitted with an intrauterine device after they had one child, and sterilized after they had two, in the early 1980s. Those who refused risked that their children would be denied access to public schools and health insurance. Civil servants and state employees who refused lost their jobs. From 1980 to 2014, according to official statistics, 324 million Chinese women were fitted with IUDs. And 107 million underwent tubal ligations or, as is commonly said, got their “tubes tied. ” Local officials were evaluated by their ability to meet targets, leading some to order that the procedures  —   as well as abortions  —   be performed by force on women who resisted. Then last year, confronting an aging population and a shrinking work force, President Xi Jinping relegated the   policy to the Communist Party’s scrap heap of discarded dogma. And without so much as an expression of regret or an admission that it had perhaps made a mistake, the party pivoted from punishing couples for having a second child to encouraging them to get on with reproducing. To that end, an official said at a recent news conference that 18 million women would be eligible for the free removal of IUDs in the next three years so they could bear a second child. “Our country provides support in terms of law, finance and service systems to ensure citizens’ access to the free removal of IUDs,” said the official, Song Li of the National Health and Family Planning Commission’s department of women and children. But the   reversal, the paternalistic attitude, the failure to accept any culpability  —   for some, it was too much. Within hours of the news conference, the internet was fuming with indignation. The mass implantation of IUDs amounted to “involuntary, forced acts of mutilation,” Han Haoyue, a popular columnist, wrote in a post shared nearly 3, 000 times on Weibo, China’s version of Twitter. “And now, to say they are offering free removal as a service to these tens of millions of women  —   repeatedly broadcasting this on state television as a kind of state benefit  —   they have no shame, second to none. ” Over the years, many Chinese women have come to hate the IUD, which is inserted into the uterus to block fertilization. In the novel “Frog,” by Mo Yan, the first Chinese citizen to win the Nobel Prize in Literature, the main character imposes a reign of terror involving the compulsory implantation of IUDs and tries to catch women who surreptitiously remove them. In mainland China, being fitted with an IUD is called “shang huan,” a phrase that literally means “installing a loop,” referring to the   stainless steel ring that was the state’s preferred device for more than a decade despite higher rates of complications. The rings were replaced in the   by safer and more effective IUDs. According to gynecologists in China, IUDs used for Chinese women were meant to be left indefinitely, with surgery necessary to take them out. Dr. Gloria Korta, a gynecologist at Winchester Physician Associates in Massachusetts, who toured Chinese hospitals as part of a cultural exchange in 2001, said that while there was a risk of infection from having an IUD implanted for many years, it was small. Perhaps because of the problems associated with the early model, there remains widespread concern in China about the IUD’s impact on women’s health. In 2012, the online portal Tencent published a lengthy report arguing that many Chinese women had “experienced serious damage to their mental and physical health” from the IUD campaign because of “rough surgeries and poor hygiene conditions. ” Ai Xiaoming, 63, a prominent documentary filmmaker, said many women, herself included, had never been advised of potential complications and the need for regular checkups after getting an IUD. She had to have a hysterectomy when surgery to remove her IUD was botched. “In the eyes of the government, women are labor units,” Ms. Ai said. “When the country needs you to give birth, you have to do so. And when they don’t need you to give birth, you don’t. ” Even before the end of the   policy, the government allowed some women to remove their IUDs if they complained of medical complications. Others, including Ms. Zhang’s mother, did it without permission, paying sympathetic doctors to remove them. But Wang Feng, a sociology professor at the University of California, Irvine, who studies the   policy, said the government appeared to be preparing to remove IUDs on a larger scale. “They were anticipating the numbers, how many operations need to be done, as if this is another government program,” he said. The government’s eagerness appears to be driven in part by growing concern over the economic impact of the nation’s plummeting birthrate, now one of the lowest in the world. According to 2015 data, Chinese women had 1. 05 children on average, well below the population replacement rate of more than 2. 1. With fewer young people to support larger numbers of retirees in China, scholars have warned of a looming demographic crisis. But many couples are not interested in having a second child, some because of the potential costs, others because of their age. Cao Cuihua, 35, a restaurant owner in the central province of Anhui and the mother of a    boy, said she did not plan to remove her IUD because she and her husband could not afford more children. “I did think about having a second child, but my economic circumstances don’t allow it,” she said. “This national policy to have two children has come a bit too late. ” Yi Fuxian, a scientist at the University of   who studies China’s demographics, said half of all Chinese women eligible to have a second child were 40 or older. “Most people have already lost the ability to give birth,” Dr. Yi said by email. “The willingness to have children is already very low, so the Chinese government’s offer of free surgeries will be of no avail. It will have little effect on the birthrate. ” Mao Qun’an, a spokesman for China’s family planning commission, defended the offer to remove IUDs and said the government would also cover the costs of surgery to reverse tubal ligations and vasectomies. (Such procedures are more complicated, and critics say most Chinese hospitals are not equipped for them.) Dr. Dalice Marriott, a gynecologist at Beijing United Family Hospital, said a woman who had an IUD for a long time ran the risk of “having it embedded in the uterine wall. ” “That makes it much more difficult to remove,” Dr. Marriott said, adding that the surgery could result in bleeding, infection and injury to the uterus. Asked about the public outcry over the government’s offer to remove IUDs, Mr. Mao replied, “We did not deliberately emphasize that it’s a government benefit. ” Li Yinhe, a prominent Chinese scholar of sex and the family, defended the government’s approach, arguing that population control measures were “not targeted against women’s rights. ” “If the state doesn’t engage in this, then it’s not only a disadvantage for men, it also hurts the interests of women,” she said. “Women giving up their reproductive rights is a sacrifice that is made for the whole Chinese society. ” But many women want the government to acknowledge that its original policy was wrong. “What they’ve done to women is inhumane,” said Xu Dali, 35, a mother of two sons in Linyi. “Why did the government force every women then to have an IUD? At that time, why did it not consider the physical harm that has been inflicted on every woman?”"
Naomie Harris: A Chameleon on Screen and Off - The New York Times,New York Times,Bee Shapiro,2017-01-25,"The British actress Naomie Harris, 40, might have splashed on the scene as the Bond girl Moneypenny, but these days she is banking on riskier roles. Her turn as a crack addict in the lauded “Moonlight” earned her supporting actress nods for the Critics’ Choice Awards, Screen Actors Guild Awards and the Golden Globes, on Sunday. So, too, her red carpet style will keep you guessing. Friend to cutouts, splashy prints, allover sequins, tuxedos and plunging necklines, Ms. Harris seems determined to avoid being typecast. And the fashion establishment appears to love her chameleonic quality. She sat front row at Christian Dior and Michael Kors, and she attended the Met Gala with Burberry. Of course, Ms. Harris doesn’t accomplish her sartorial variety on her own. She has been working with Nola Singer, also a close friend, for the last five years. “She loves to experiment,” Ms. Singer said of their choices. “It’s not so serious. If I tell her someone is a new designer, she gets excited. She gets that this is a kind of freedom. That’s beautiful about her. ” Ms. Singer, who is based in Los Angeles, styled many of Ms. Harris’s looks over the past year, but the actress also worked with Micaela Erlanger, Lupita Nyong’o’s   for her “Collateral Beauty” press tour. With Ms. Singer, Ms. Harris has favored simple fitted silhouettes but often lets color do the talking. Witness a sequined goldenrod Ralph Lauren halterneck dress worn to the Hollywood Foreign Press   cocktail party in November. “Every actress was at that event, and she really stood out, not because she was trying but because of that color, and because it flattered her figure  —   her arms!  —   without showing too much skin,” Ms. Singer said. No   triceps dips were needed for the visual statement made by a Gucci silver metallic tuxedo at the Hollywood Film Awards the same month. Ms. Singer said the outfit, with its sharp tailoring and lion embroidered on the back, was a nod to Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. “It was about women being empowered,” she said. Though Ms. Harris knows her way around a pantsuit (see also a white Emanuel Ungaro option at Variety’s Women of Power Luncheon, and a white   Dolce  Gabbana number worn to the TimesTalks event for “Moonlight”) occasionally she likes to go retro. In the navy Carolina Herrera ball gown she wore (with Christian Louboutin flats) to the Governors Awards in November, she was having an Old Hollywood meets modern practicalities moment. Less successful are her quirky moments. An orange Gucci minidress with a frilly black neckline that she wore at the British Independent Film Awards and a brown print Rodarte with    white bust at the “Collateral Beauty” London premiere read   on her lithe frame. Ms. Erlanger’s choice for the “Collateral Beauty” New York premiere was more on point: a neon floral Rosie Assoulin dress that ended above the ankle with Dick   pumps. Sure it was December, but what’s a little   chill when an   campaign is at stake? More unexpected picks with Ms. Erlanger included an offbeat (perhaps dated?) Stella McCartney strapless black bodice with sheer skirt design for the Critics’ Choice Awards last month, and a winning gold sequined tunic and pants by Monse at the Gotham Independent Film Awards in November. And if her predictability is in her unpredictability, Ms. Harris is throwing another wrench in for awards season. She is going back to Ms. Singer but adding the New York stylist Laura Jones, known for her work with Alicia Keys, to her team. It will be Ms. Harris’s first time working with Ms. Jones."
U.S. Consulate Official Shot and Wounded in Mexico - The New York Times,New York Times,Elisabeth Malkin,2017-01-08,"MEXICO CITY  —   An official working at the United States consulate in Guadalajara, the   city in Mexico, was shot and wounded on Friday evening by a young man who stalked him in the parking lot of a shopping mall and then fired as he drove out. The State Department official, who was not identified, was in stable condition after the shooting, a spokeswoman from the United States Embassy in Mexico City said on Saturday. Neither embassy officials nor the Mexican attorney general’s office commented on a possible motive. Guadalajara is the capital of Jalisco, the headquarters of the New Generation Jalisco cartel, an organized crime gang that has carried out violent attacks on the Mexican military and police over the past two years. But residents of the city have rarely been a focus of cartel violence. Security footage released by the consulate on its Facebook page shows the gunman, dressed in a loosefitting dark blue   and pants and wearing glasses, waiting on the sidewalk adjacent to the exit ramp of an underground parking lot in an upscale neighborhood. A white car pulls up to the barrier gate, waits for the arm to lift and drives off. Then, as the consular official’s black car pulls up, the gunman raises his arm, fires and runs away. In a separate video, taken a few minutes earlier, at 6:16 p. m. the consular official, wearing red shorts and with a gym bag slung over his shoulder, pays at the automated ticket machine and walks off, with the gunman following him. The F. B. I. said it was offering a $20, 000 reward to anybody who could provide information leading to the identification of the gunman. “The safety and security of our employees overseas is our highest priority,” the United States Embassy spokeswoman said. Eduardo Almaguer, the attorney general for Jalisco, told the local news media that the consular employee worked in the visa section of the consulate. State and federal authorities are working on the investigation. Employees of the United States Embassy and consulates in Mexico have been victims of drug violence in the past few years, though they have sometimes been targeted by mistake. That was the case in 2010 of a consulate employee in the border city of Ciudad Juárez, her husband and the husband of another employee who were killed. The white S. U. V. that the employee and her husband were driving in was mistaken for the vehicle of a gang leader whose killing was ordered by a rival. In 2011, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent was killed and another injured when they were ambushed by members of a drug gang hit squad on a highway. The next year, two C. I. A. employees were wounded when federal police officers fired at their armored car in an attack that has never been explained."
300 Marines to Aid Fight Against Taliban in Spring - The New York Times,New York Times,Mujib Mashal,2017-01-08,"KABUL, Afghanistan  —   Approximately 300 United States Marines will return this spring to help fight a resurgent Taliban in the southern Afghan province of Helmand, the site of a yearslong bloody campaign, American officials in Afghanistan said on Saturday. An American military spokesman in Kabul said the Marines would replace an Army unit stationed in Helmand, and would offer training and advice to members of the Afghan military and the national police. “The Marine rotation is to replace soldiers currently here conducting the train, advise and assist mission,” said Brig. Gen. Charles H. Cleveland, a spokesman for United States forces in Afghanistan. “We’re very pleased that the Marines will rotate in, as they have tremendous institutional history in the region. ” The Marines were last in Helmand, a hotbed of Taliban fighters and poppy cultivation, in October 2014. Since then, Afghan forces, suffering from leadership woes and plagued by corruption, have struggled to hold territory, with district after district falling to the Taliban. For months now, the insurgents have been at the gates of the provincial capital, Lashkar Gah. The Afghan military welcomed the news of the Marines’ return. “We have been asking our foreign counterparts in security meetings to increase the level of their troops in Helmand Province to help us on the battlefields,” said Shakil Ahmad, an Afghan Army spokesman. Mr. Ahmad said the security situation in region was rapidly deteriorating. The Taliban appeared unfazed by the news of the Marines’ return. “Our mujahedeen continued their progress in the presence of tens of thousands of Americans and other invading forces,” said Qari Yousef Ahmadi, a Taliban spokesman. “A few hundred other soldiers won’t become an obstacle on the way of our progress. ” Fewer than 8, 400 American troops are currently in Afghanistan, deployed either through NATO to train Afghan forces or as part of a smaller American counterterrorism mission. President Obama declared the United States combat mission in Afghanistan over in December 2014. But in the past year, as violence has spread across the country, the line for the American military between consulting and fighting has increasingly blurred. At the peak of a troop surge in 2011, there were about 20, 000 Marines fighting across Helmand alongside thousands of British soldiers. Western troops fought the Taliban village to village, and tried to win civilians’ hearts and minds by doling out cash for bridges and roads. The Taliban recently told Lashkar Gah residents to store food items, warning that they would once again cut off Helmand’s main highway to the regional economic hub, Kandahar Province. Unlike in the past, fighting between government troops and the Taliban has not diminished with the coming of this year’s winter. Many fear that when fighting intensifies in the spring, the Taliban will be starting from a position of strength around several provincial capitals. Ensuring that Afghan leaders take advantage of the winter to improve leadership and root out corruption will be critical to how they tackle Taliban pressure in the spring, American officials said."
Brock Osweiler and Texans Knock the Battered Raiders Out of the Playoffs - The New York Times,New York Times,The Associated Press,2017-01-08,"HOUSTON  —   Follow our live N. F. L. playoffs coverage here. Brock Osweiler redeemed himself after last month’s benching. Jadeveon Clowney established himself as a postseason force. And the Houston Texans got their first playoff victory since the 2012 season, beating the Oakland Raiders,   on Saturday. Osweiler threw for a touchdown and ran for another to lead the Texans to the win, in the   round. Clowney, erasing doubts that he deserved to be the top pick in the 2014 draft, got his first career interception, on the Raiders’ second drive. Osweiler, who got his job back last week after Tom Savage sustained a concussion, finished with only 168 passing yards but played his best game of the season. “It just goes back to having confidence in my teammates,” said Osweiler, who had never played in a playoff game, having been benched by the Denver Broncos last postseason in favor of Peyton Manning. “Believing in what you see, and just rip it. Cut it loose, and don’t have any hesitation. ” Houston ( ) and its   defense, led by Clowney and Whitney Mercilus, advanced to face either the Kansas City Chiefs or the New England Patriots in the divisional round. Clowney was roundly criticized in his first two   seasons before his star turn this season as he helped make up for the loss of J. J. Watt, who was placed on injured reserve in September. “Things didn’t go well earlier in my career, but I’m on the right track now,” Clowney said. The Raiders were making their first trip to the playoffs since the 2002 season, when they went to the Super Bowl, but it ended with a thud behind the struggles of their   quarterback, the rookie Connor Cook. He threw for 161 yards, with one touchdown and three interceptions. “It was his first start, on the road, in a playoff game, against the No.   defense,” Raiders Coach Jack Del Rio said. “It was a tough draw for him. We had hopes that we would be able to do enough around him so he wouldn’t have to do as much. ” Cook became the first quarterback in N. F. L. history to make his first start in a playoff game. The usual starter, Derek Carr, a contender for the Most Valuable Player Award, broke his leg two weeks ago, and Matt McGloin injured his shoulder last weekend. The Raiders were also missing their star left tackle, Donald Penn, whose streak of 160 straight starts ended because of a knee injury. The Raiders ( ) got touchdowns from Latavius Murray and Andre Holmes, but cornerback David Amerson said things would have been different if the team had fewer injuries. “I’ve got all the faith in Connor or Matt  —   any backups we’ve got,” he said. “But they know, at full strength, ain’t nobody in the league touching us, man. We’re going to take this loss on the chin, and we’re going to come back, for sure. ” Houston led by 13 at halftime after touchdowns by DeAndre Hopkins and Lamar Miller, who scored a play after Clowney’s interception. Houston increased its lead to   on a   run by Osweiler early in the fourth quarter."
"In Turkey’s Unrest, Some See an Extreme Version of Post-9/11 America - The New York Times",New York Times,Tim Arango and Rick Gladstone,2017-01-08,"ISTANBUL  —   An Islamic State disciple kills 39 New Year’s revelers at an Istanbul nightclub. A gunman with a police badge assassinates Russia’s ambassador at an Ankara reception. Kurdish separatist bombers kill 14 soldiers on a bus in central Turkey and dozens of police officers at an Istanbul soccer match. Those assaults were just in the last few weeks, which made a car bombing on Thursday in the city of Izmir, where at least two civilians were killed, seem relatively minor. The 75 million people of Turkey, the NATO member and European Union aspirant that straddles Europe and Asia and was once seen as a stable democracy, are facing a ferocious onslaught of terrorist attacks unlike anything that has been seen in the West. Add to that the tumult from roughly three million Syrian war refugees, a resurgent Kurdish insurgency and a failed military coup  —   all tied, in the eyes of many Turks, to American negligence, or malice, or both. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has responded with a furious crackdown on an array of perceived enemies, including the news media, and has lashed out at what he regards as Western complicity. While Mr. Erdogan’s critics have denounced what they see as a bald usurpation of power that has subverted democracy and polarized the country, many Turks, frightened and uncertain, are not complaining. They view his authoritarianism as reassuring and angrily reject outsider comments about paranoia and conspiracy theories. Some are even embracing the advent of   Donald J. Trump, despite his   statements, viewing him as a decisive strongman sympathetic to Mr. Erdogan, an Islamist with little tolerance for those who dispute him. In some ways, political historians and scholars say, what is happening in Turkey parallels the aftermath of the 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States, the 2015 attacks in France and, most recently, the response to attacks in Germany. In all of them, many citizens were willing to overlook or forsake civil liberties, government powers grew, fringe groups strengthened and spread intolerance, and dissent was regarded with suspicion. “I think there are a lot of similar tendencies, and it leads to, in an extreme case, what we’re seeing in Turkey,” said Steven A. Cook, a senior fellow for Middle East and African Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington. Still, Mr. Cook said, “It’s not that far a leap to go to an extreme  —   can you imagine if the attacks in Turkey had happened in the United States?” On Friday, Hilal Kaplan, a columnist for Daily Sabah, a newspaper close to the government, lashed out at Western news coverage, including an article in The New York Times, that has emphasized conspiracy theories coursing through Turkish society that the United States is behind terrorism in Turkey. Describing the article as “an attempt to condescend and affront rather than reflecting an effort to understand Turkey,” Ms. Kaplan said that Turks have good reason to be suspicious of the United States. She pointed out that Fethullah Gulen, the cleric and former Erdogan ally who many Turks believe was behind the coup attempt, lives in Pennsylvania, and that a former C. I. A. official had once vouched for Mr. Gulen on his green card application. In addition, she called attention to something else: The United States has provided military support to a Syrian Kurdish militia fighting Islamic State extremists, a militia that Turkey considers an ally of the P. K. K. the outlawed Kurdish separatist organization regarded as a terrorist enemy. In her Friday column, headlined “Why Turkey is looking forward to Trump administration,” she added, “do they really need such details if their only wish is to represent the Turkish people as paranoid and Erdogan as a villain?” In another parallel to    America, the Turkish government has aggressively exploited tragic events to stoke patriotic feelings and to frame the broader struggle within the country as a fight to secure democracy, even if democratic practices are eroded to do so. The comparison was not lost on Turkish scholars, even those critical of Mr. Erdogan, who were in the United States when the World Trade Center and the Pentagon were attacked. “I couldn’t believe the extent to which there was a rise in nationalism, even among academics,” said Kemal Kirisci, a senior fellow and director of The Turkey Project at the Brookings Institution, recalling his own memories of living in America. “I felt intimidated intellectually, almost felt censured. ” After the coup attempt, the government moved quickly to memorialize victims and places rived by violence, renaming a bridge in Istanbul and a square in Ankara, and changing street names to honor citizens who died defending Mr. Erdogan’s government. At year’s end, the prime minister’s office delivered packages to foreign correspondents in Turkey. Inside a black velvet box, with a silver clasp, was a small marble chunk, described as rubble from the Parliament building in Ankara, retrieved after an attack was carried out during the coup attempt. A note said that the rock “is presented to you as a symbol of Turkey’s devotion to democracy. ” And like American leaders who exhort citizens to maintain daily routines after terrorist attacks, the Turkish prime minister, Binali Yildirim, urged Turks this week to carry on. “Our citizens should not change the flow of their normal lives,” Mr. Yildirim said in a speech. “If they do, it will be serving the purposes of the terror group. ” Mr. Erdogan and his allies see a double standard in the West’s reaction to Turkey, and say that some of the same measures Turkey is taking to combat terrorism, like resorting to emergency rule, have been embraced in the West, particularly in France. It is this disconnect  —   between how Turkey perceives its own experience and the West’s reaction to events in Turkey  —   that has contributed to Turkey pulling away from its NATO allies, and moving closer to Russia. “In France there is emergency rule for three months, and again for three months, and lately for six months, in total for a year,” Mr. Erdogan said in September. “Is anyone from around the world asking France, ‘why did you declare emergency rule for a year? ’” Mr. Erdogan emphasized that the violence Turkey has faced is far greater than in countries like France. “My brothers, Turkey was the scene of terror incidents so heavy that they cannot be compared with France, and more importantly we faced a coup attempt,” he said. “From this perspective I believe my country will understand the extension of emergency rule, and support it. ” In a speech on Friday, Mr. Erdogan underscored the deep traumas Turkey has suffered in recent years. “I do not believe any other country exists that went on its way standing upright after living with what we have gone through since 2013,” Mr. Erdogan said. “We became a unique example in history. We showed democracy can be protected together with security challenges. ” Mr. Erdogan’s supporters say they are especially upset over how the West has reacted to Turkey’s response to terrorism, saying they had expected solidarity, not criticism. “This is an obvious, very serious and problematic disrespect against Turkey’s right to defend itself against terror,” said Mustafa Yeneroglu, a member of Parliament with Mr. Erdogan’s Islamist Justice and Development Party. Mr. Yeneroglu, the head of Parliament’s human rights committee, said Turkey faced the same conundrum any country faces when traumatized by terrorist acts. “If there is no security, there would be no room to enjoy the liberties,” he said. “This situation leads to prioritizing security while answering questions, ‘security or liberty?’ This is not only valid for Turkey but for all other liberal democracies. ” Turkish liberals say they understand the need for extraordinary measures, but they make two counter arguments. One is that Turkey’s broad crackdown  —   in putting so many journalists and intellectuals in jail  —   has gone too far, and is seemingly unrelated to fighting terrorism. Another is that, even with emergency rule, the country has become less safe. “On the contrary, we have faced more attacks, more terror,” said Yaman Akdeniz, a lawyer and professor at Bilgi University in Istanbul who represents many jailed journalists. He continued, “there is emergency rule in France, but there is no other country limiting fundamental rights and freedoms on this scale. ” Orhan Kemal Cengiz, a prominent human rights lawyer who was briefly detained after the attempted coup, put it this way: “Yes, ISIS is attacking. The P. K. K. is attacking. There was this coup d’état attempt. But what is this to do with all these journalists? There are over 150 journalists in jail. And with every passing day, they arrest more and more people. ” Marc Pierini, a visiting scholar at Carnegie Europe in Brussels who was a former European Union ambassador to Turkey, said the   purges in the military, the courts and the police have, paradoxically, compromised the country’s ability to protect the public. Mr. Pierini also took issue with the government’s contention that its response to threats has been appropriate. “As we’ve seen after the coup, the reaction is way outside of the formal rule of law. You started arresting police and gendarmes, now writers, actors, journalists  —   so there is no limit,” he said. “When you start pulling the thread on the rule of law, the whole sweater can come off. And that’s where we stand. ”"
"Light Pillars, a Million-Mirror Optical Illusion on Winter Nights - The New York Times",New York Times,JoAnna Klein,2017-01-17,"Don’t worry. It’s totally natural. There’s no mother ship hovering above the earth, waiting to carry you away, and no demon shooting light from beneath, signaling to pull you below. It’s a light pillar  —   or a few of them  —   a colorful column of sparkling light that appears to beam up toward the sky. It’s all just an icy illusion. And now, during winter, when nights are long and cold, you have a good chance to spot one as long as conditions are right. If you’re lucky enough to spot a light pillar, what you’re seeing is actually artificial light from a ground source reflecting off millions of floating ice crystals. “It’s not an upward beam of light,” said Les Cowley, a physicist who runs a website on atmospheric optics, or the way light travels through the atmosphere. “Although they look pretty, they’re also a sign that someone, somewhere could do better with their lighting. You might call them light pollution pillars if you wanted to be environmental about it. ” Light pillars occur when   clouds  —   normally miles high in the atmosphere  —   cling closer to the Earth’s surface, just a hundred or a few thousand feet above it. These thin clouds contain millions of flat, hexagonal crystals of ice that float horizontally in the air Each ice crystal acts like a mirror pointed downward, reflecting the artificial light back to your eyes  —   as long as the cloud is about halfway between you and the light source. Together, the crystals form a cluster of mirrors floating at different heights, which allows you to see the light as a column if they all were at the same level, you’d see only a spot of light. The pillars can be quite colorful at times because each reflected beam is the same color as its source. To find a good source  —   one bright, close to the ground, and just far enough away  —   your best bet is to travel a few miles outside your city or town on a dark night. The weather doesn’t have to be frigid, but it helps. Light pillars are frequently spotted in Scandinavia, upstate New York, Canada and other cold spots in the winter. But Dr. Cowley said that this week he received a photo of light pillars from about 30 miles outside of a town in Iran  —   perhaps because the desert can get cold at night. If leaving the city is not an option, look up at streetlights on a freezing cold night. You may spot the sparkly, ghostly blur of diamond dust. This illusion is created by the same flat ice crystals that produce light pillars, but this time, they’re so low to the ground you can feel them prickling your skin. “When that happens, you see other nearby halos, and it’s quite a spectacular sight,” Dr. Cowley said."
"Tilikum, the Killer Whale Featured in ‘Blackfish,’ Dies - The New York Times",New York Times,Christine Hauser,2017-01-07,"Tilikum, the captive orca who killed a trainer at SeaWorld in Orlando, Fla. in 2010 and later became the subject of the documentary “Blackfish,”  died on Friday. The whale had been suffering from a persistent infection from a bacteria found in wild habitats and natural settings, but the exact cause of death will be determined by a necropsy, SeaWorld Parks  Entertainment said in a statement. The orca, a male estimated to be about 36 years old, had been kept by the organization for 25 years. “While today is a difficult day for the SeaWorld family, it’s important to remember that Tilikum lived a long and enriching life while at SeaWorld and inspired millions of people to care about this amazing species,” the statement said. “Tilikum had, and will continue to have, a special place in the hearts of the SeaWorld family, as well as the millions of people all over the world that he inspired,” said the president of SeaWorld, Joel Manby. Tilikum’s caretakers had said in March that the whale was afflicted with the infection that was likely to lead to his death. The whale was at the center of an orca breeding program that SeaWorld ended last year. The company also ended its killer whale performances in San Diego, where state lawmakers had brought intense pressure on the company after the documentary’s release. With the death of Tilikum, SeaWorld now holds 22 orcas at its three facilities in Orlando, San Antonio and San Diego. SeaWorld also noted that Tilikum was “inextricably connected” with the death of his trainer, Dawn Brancheau, in 2010. “While we all experienced profound sadness about that loss, we continued to offer Tilikum the best care possible, each and every day, from the country’s leading experts in marine mammals,” the SeaWorld statement said. Tilikum bit down on the ponytail of Ms. Brancheau, his    trainer, before dragging her underwater and killing her. After her death, SeaWorld conducted an extensive review that resulted in trainers further isolating themselves from the animals for safety. In 2013, the documentary “Blackfish” examined Ms. Brancheau’s death by looking at the mental state of whales that are taken from their pods in the wild and raised at marine parks. But SeaWorld pushed back against the film’s claims that the whales in captivity suffer physical and mental distress because of confinement. Tilikum has also been connected with the deaths of two other people: Keltie Byrne, a    student and   trainer who slipped into a pool containing Tilikum and two other orcas in 1991, and Daniel P. Dukes, a    man who slipped into SeaWorld after hours in 1999. Mr. Dukes was found dead, draped over Tilikum’s back. Tilikum came to SeaWorld in 1991 from Sealand of the Pacific in Canada, and the organization said it had not collected a whale from the wild in nearly 40 years."
What TV Says About Race and Money - The New York Times,New York Times,Salamishah Tillet,2017-01-15,"Some of the most fascinating conversations about class anxiety aren’t happening on cable news networks these days but on a more unexpected place on television: shows like “Atlanta,” “ ” and “Insecure,” which have explored a profound, if largely ignored, economic issue  —   black downward mobility. On “” the Johnson family is led by Dre, a marketing executive, and Bow, a doctor. They have four children in private school and a house in an affluent, predominantly white neighborhood in Los Angeles. They took a vacation to Disney World estimated to cost more than $20, 000. But despite the family’s seeming stability, “ ” is largely about class tension. A central dilemma is Dre’s battle between his financial aspirations and racial authenticity, his    and his loyalty to his   roots. One of the best episodes this season, “Jack of All Trades,” opens with Dre (Anthony Anderson) and Bow (Tracee Ellis Ross) learning of their young twins’ career test results: Diane (Marsai Martin) might be in a “position of power in a political organization,” while Jack (Miles Brown) is likely to be “a member of a unionized group of skilled laborers. ” Despite Jack’s obvious excitement about, and talent for, the manual trades, his parents become obsessed with redirecting his career trajectory, worried that he will be pigeonholed, like Dre’s   father, Pops (Laurence Fishburne) in a   job for the rest of his life. As Pop’s presence reminds us, while Dre’s parents worked hard to provide him with an education, Dre did not inherit wealth, making his    status both new and fragile. This is a legitimate worry because more and more members of the   middle class are finding themselves in an economic downslide, with little hope that the next generation will earn more than the one before. In 2015, the Pew Research Center released a report detailing that the number of American households earning a   income had reached its lowest point in over 40 years. And the gap between the wealth of white and black families has widened to its highest level since 1989, according to a Pew report from 2014. Black male children raised in   households in the late 1970s and early ’80s have fallen out of the middle class at particularly higher rates than white male children after becoming adults, another Pew report found. On shows like Donald Glover’s “Atlanta” on FX and Issa Rae’s “Insecure” on HBO, both about a group of    professionally striving and financially struggling (and both, along with “” nominated for Golden Globes) the theme of black downward mobility is put into high relief. “Comedy in the black community is almost always about struggle,” said Mary Pattillo, author of “Black Picket Fences: Privilege and Peril Among the Black Middle Class. ” “And while exploring class differences is not new for black sitcoms, it is important that these themes are reproduced and restaged for each generation. The specifics might be different, but every generation returns to this theme because the precarity of the black middle class has not disappeared. ” On “Atlanta,” we meet Earn, a Princeton dropout who grew up in a   family and who works at an airport kiosk. He quits that job to manage his cousin, an    rapper named Alfred Miles, known as Paper Boi (Brian Tyree Henry) who has a song on the radio but makes a living as a drug dealer. Earn’s economic instability is exacerbated when his    girlfriend and his daughter’s mother, Van (Zazie Beetz) loses her job as an elementary schoolteacher because it was the only constant source of income for the family. “‘Atlanta’ offers up a realistic portrait of the vulnerability that the black middle class faces today,” said Jessica S. Welburn, a sociologist at the University of Iowa who researches   downward mobility. “While the election of the first   president gives many a sense of progress, racial disparities have also intensified and limited what has typically been a pathway to the middle class for   like a college degree or a government job. Knowing this,   still try to break through these barriers with obviously mixed results. ” “The Jacket,” the season finale of “Atlanta,” offers up one of the most pointed critiques of structural racism that I have seen on television this year: Neither Earn’s   childhood nor his Princeton education can protect him from the constraints that he and his friends find themselves under. After Earn wakes up in a strange house in a strange bed without his jacket, we follow him on an increasingly desperate search in increasingly dangerous situations. He finally arrives outside the home of the Uber driver who has his jacket, only to witness him being shot by the police. As extraordinary as that trauma might be for most Americans, the show portrays the sort of everyday violence to which   and Latinos, of various classes, are vulnerable. If race is intimately tied to class, so is gender, as Ms. Rae’s “Insecure” so poignantly reminds us. The main conflict on the series is its female protagonists, Issa and her best friend, Molly (Yvonne Orji) navigating the muddy waters of millennial dating. We first meet Issa, who works at a nonprofit, and her     boyfriend, Lawrence (Jay Ellis) on shaky ground. Despite his Georgetown degree, Lawrence is an entrepreneur unable to finalize his business plan or find a corporate job. He settles on working at Best Buy, and later, with encouragement from Issa, sets aside his dream of developing an app to take a gig at a tech  . And while the season concludes with a   breakup, their relationship was perhaps doomed from the beginning, by his inertia, his unemployment and their economic insecurity. Through Molly, a lawyer who brilliantly   between corporate and colloquial vernacular, the show explores how class mobility often differs for   women and men. After a string of disappointing romantic encounters, Molly ends up dating Jared (Langston Kerman) a witty, caring guy whom Issa jokingly calls “  ” because he works at Enterprise. Molly ends their relationship (the first of two times) after she and her friends find out he did not attend college. Averil Y. Clarke, author of “Inequalities of Love:   Black Women and the Barriers to Romance and Family,” said: “  black women are plagued by a very common racial problem. They, like most women, are encouraged to pursue the   script: Go to college, get a good job and get married and have kids. ” She added, “But, when it comes to dating, black women’s class aspirations are more likely to be unfulfilled than white women, their femininity and sense of value more likely to feel under assault. ” Historically, whether it was the striving of “The Jeffersons” or “The Fresh Prince of  ” or the   settings of shows like “Sanford and Son,” “Roc” or “Thea,” class differences have dominated black sitcoms in the    era. That these three recent shows are all created by   (Kenya Barris created “ ”) might enable them to attend differently to these nuances of   lives. Ms. Rae said in an interview with Vox, “This isn’t a show exclusively about, like, the struggle of being black. ” Instead, “It’s just regular black people living life. ” By setting her show in South Los Angeles, she is able to reveal the spectrum of   class diversity, as she noted in an interview with The Daily Beast: “Yes, there’s poverty there, there are gang members there, but there’s also affluence, there’s middle class, and everybody meshes together. ” Likewise, Mr. Glover said in an interview with Vulture, “I wanted to show white people, you don’t know everything about black culture. ” In that same interview, he underscores that one key difference is how he depicts class diversity. When Mr. Glover heard a suggestion that Paper Boi live in a   “traplike” home, he refused. “We were like: ‘No, he’s a drug dealer, he makes enough money to live in a regular apartment. ’” He added, “There were some things so subtle and black that people had no idea what we were talking about. ” Taken together, these sitcoms remind us of the centrality of race, not just to our conversations but to policies around income inequality. That the coming years may yield a hiring freeze on the federal work force, the continuing decline of unions, and more suffering for both   and     is no laughing matter. But, as the adage goes: Sometimes we simply have to laugh to keep from crying."
The Making of Virtually Real Art With Google’s Tilt Brush - The New York Times,New York Times,Frank Rose,2017-01-06,"SAN FRANCISCO  —   In 1949, a Life magazine photographer named Gjon Mili made a pilgrimage to the French Riviera to see Pablo Picasso. Mili had come up with a way to photograph trails of light, and he wanted to shoot Picasso “drawing” in midair with a light pen  —   a process that would leave no trace except on film. Picasso loved it. The result, published in Life and exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art, was Picasso’s celebrated series of “light drawings” of bulls and centaurs and the like  —   photographs that captured him in the act of creating the ultimate in ephemeral art. Picasso is long gone. But some 68 years later, Google has been calling on dozens of artists, animators and illustrators with a   update of Mili’s concept  —   a virtual reality setup that enables people to paint with light that actually stays where you put it, at least for viewers wearing a VR headset. In place of Gjon Mili are Drew Skillman and Patrick Hackett, a pair of video game developers turned virtual reality enthusiasts who live in San Francisco. They were trying to build a   chess application one night a couple of years ago when they discovered it had an unexpected side effect: As you moved the chess pieces around in virtual space, they left trails of light behind. Sensing that their bug was in fact a feature, the two dropped the chess project immediately and hurled themselves at the light trails, hoping to develop a tool for drawing in three dimensions. In April 2015, seven months after they had cobbled together a rudimentary system they called Tilt Brush, Google bought their company for an undisclosed sum  —   which is how Mr. Skillman and Mr. Hackett have come to be ensconced in the company’s offices near the downtown waterfront here. With Google’s support, Tilt Brush has attracted a team of developers and evolved into a sophisticated tool for drawing, painting, even sculpting in space. It was released in April as a free   to the new HTC Vive, an $800 virtual reality system produced by the Taiwanese manufacturer HTC in partnership with Valve, an American video game developer. (It’s on sale as a $30 software package from Valve’s online store.) Reviewers immediately dubbed it the Vive’s killer app. This is hardly the kind of reception the two inventors were expecting when they started working on it in Mr. Skillman’s apartment, a    studio in South Park, the little neighborhood that has been a hub for San Francisco’s digerati since the 1990s. “Not in our wildest dreams,” said Mr. Skillman, a slightly built    with a neatly trimmed beard and a modest, unassuming manner. Tilt Brush got its name because in its earliest versions, you would draw or paint on a   surface that could be tilted in any direction in virtual space. But because the HTC Vive includes not just a virtual reality headset but also a pair of   controllers and two tracking sensors that map your movement in space, the program was revamped to enable you to paint or draw anywhere within a   area  —   no surface required. One controller serves as a palette, with dozens of colors and effects the other acts as a brush or pen. To watch someone use it is a bit unnerving, since the person appears to be making marks in midair, but you can’t actually see those. But put on a Vive headset and step between the sensors yourself  —   as I did in a windowless room in Google’s New York offices  —   and the illusion of delusion disappears. Instead, you suddenly see what has been produced: a phantom creation in three dimensions, something you can walk around, walk through, poke your head inside, do everything except touch. Google’s investment in virtual reality pales beside Facebook’s $2 billion purchase of the VR pioneer Oculus. Still, Tilt Brush is part of a growing effort, one that began with the introduction in 2014 of supercheap cardboard headsets that work with smartphones, and continues with the recent release of a stunning virtual reality version of Google Earth as a free download for Vive owners. Over the past year, Google has invited more than 60 people to try Tilt Brush and offer feedback, and this week the company is unveiling their work and participation. “You would never want to create an artistic tool with only engineers,” said Mr. Skillman. “That’s just absurd. ” According to Tory Voight, Google’s Tilt Brush program manager, those who have joined this    program include Dustin Yellin, a Brooklyn artist known for his   collages encased in layers of glass, and Jonathan Yeo, a British painter whose portrait of Kevin Spacey as the fictional American president Francis J. Underwood was exhibited last year at the Smithsonian Institution’s National Portrait Gallery. Jeff Koons, whose art works have sold at auction for as much as $58 million, had early access, though he was not part of the artists in residence program. Bob Mankoff, Roz Chast and other cartoonists for The New Yorker have also checked it out, as has Alex Hirsch, the young animator behind Disney’s hit television series “Gravity Falls. ” Last June, Mr. Hirsch posted a sample creation on Twitter along with an enthusiastic status update: “Drawing in virtual reality makes you feel like a   wizard god!” But the first to try it was Glen Keane, a   figure who in his 37 years at Disney had brought the warmth of   animation to such characters as Ariel (in “The Little Mermaid”) Aladdin, Tarzan and Pocahontas. “When I left Disney in 2012,” Mr. Keane said recently in his studio, a vintage bungalow on a quiet residential street in West Hollywood, Calif. “I told them it was because I know there’s something new coming  —   I don’t know what it is, but I need to leave to find it. ” He was still looking when he met Regina Dugan, then the leader of Google’s secretive Advanced Technology and Products group, which was experimenting with virtual reality. First he partnered with the group to make a   virtual reality short called “Duet,” a charming piece released in 2014 about two babies growing up that was shortlisted for an Academy Award. “Duet” broke new ground, since animation in virtual reality had almost exclusively been  . But though he’d spent a lifetime drawing on paper, Mr. Keane had always dreamed of being able to make the paper disappear. “The goal would be to animate not on paper but in space,” he said. Enter Tilt Brush, which Mr. Keane encountered when Mr. Skillman introduced himself at a visual effects conference in San Francisco. Though still in a primitive state, it was maturing rapidly, and Mr. Keane soon became a convert. In September 2015, seven months before its release, he previewed its capabilities with “Step Into the Page,” a   video. “The edges of the paper are no longer there,” he exclaimed in a   as he did a loose, freehand sketch of Ariel in virtual space. “This is not a flat drawing. This is sculptural drawing. ” Scott McCloud, the graphic artist whose book “Understanding Comics” is considered the ultimate guide to the art form, got to play with Tilt Brush when Google invited him to its Silicon Valley headquarters in August. “I don’t mind saying, I’m a little bit obsessed with this program,” he said as we sat in his small,   office in a mall in the Los Angeles exurb of Thousand Oaks. “One thing that appeals to me the most is, it’s still very early. Everyone is asking fundamental questions. We’re still trying to figure out what people are going to use it for. I love it when technology is in that stage. ” So, what are people going to use it for? Mr. McCloud threw out a few suggestions: performance art, virtual sculpture, industrial prototyping. “I doodle with it,” said Mr. Yeo, the painter, who spoke by telephone from London. “I describe it as a   sketchbook. ” What it won’t produce is anything resembling comics as they currently exist in the medium some call “Flatland. ” For denizens of Flatland who have learned to work within the constraints of   this can be problematic. Mr. Mankoff, the cartoon editor at The New Yorker, came up with some characteristically     drawings during the two days he spent using Tilt Brush with Ms. Chast and other colleagues at Google’s New York offices. But though he professes to have enjoyed the experience, he seems unlikely to lead The New Yorker out of Flatland. “You’ll probably find a sharp divide between older and younger cartoonists,” he said. “Or it may just not work  —   but that’s no reason not to try it. ” One suggestion the New Yorker team had: cubes and cylinders and other   shapes to draw on, “so you’re not starting from zero in   space. ” (Google has since implemented a similar idea.) Other than that, Mr. Mankoff offered with a grin: “The advice I would have for Google is, more cats. You can’t go wrong with cats. ” Mr. Keane has a different item on his wish list. Currently, works created in Tilt Brush are as motionless as a New Yorker cartoon. They’re essentially static, and Mr. Keane is an animator. “To me, the thing to conquer is to be able to animate in real time in space,” he said as I viewed a Tilt Brush drawing called “Victory Dance” in his studio. The piece captures a brief moment in time, seconds after his daughter’s high school choir had won a national championship  —   but it begs to be brought to life. “Just like you have a spatial dimension, you’ve got to have time as a dimension,” Mr. Keane continued. “There’s no reason you can’t do that. I’m not smart enough to figure it out. But Drew is. ”"
Seizing a Second Chance to Graduate From High School - The New York Times,New York Times,Emily Palmer and John Otis,2017-01-08,"She skipped almost every class her sophomore year and still maintained perfect attendance. The trick was to drop in for the start of third period, wait for attendance to be recorded for the day and then leave with a bathroom pass. By the time her mother found out about the scheme, Skylynn Vazquez was failing every subject. Most days, Saquan Bright did not bother to show up at Boys and Girls High School in   Brooklyn. He chose to roam the streets with his friends. But then Ms. Vazquez and Mr. Bright found a school designed for students like them: Brooklyn High School for Leadership and Community Service in Clinton Hill, which is operated by Brooklyn Community Services, one of eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. Leadership, one of 57 transfer schools in New York City  —   established to help students struggling in traditional schools  —   has 202 students ages 16 to 21. By the time students reach Leadership, they have either dropped out of their regular schools or neared that point because of low grades or poor attendance. Many come from unstable homes, living with single parents in shelters and temporary housing, and have spent time in the criminal justice system. And 82 percent of the students qualify for free lunch because of their family’s income. The flexible school schedule  —   which allows for free periods  —   enables students to concentrate on courses required to graduate. And the school provides an optional paid internship program, which is appealing to students, some of whom help support their families or who are legally emancipated and support themselves. Before Leadership, Mr. Bright could not keep up with the demands at Boys and Girls High School. He struggled to pay attention in class, and could not finish tests in time. Still, he was not tested for a learning disability until he was enrolled at Leadership. Now he receives services at Leadership and extended time for tests, and his grades have improved. At her previous school, in Bushwick, Ms. Vazquez purposefully broke the rules. She wore hats at school every day, even though they were forbidden, and each one was taken away. “There was a point where I didn’t have any of my hats,” she said. “All 30 of my hats were locked in the dean’s office. ” She enrolled at that school midway through her freshman year, after moving from Florida. She recalled skipping classes and darting off to play basketball and video games with a handful of friends, most of whom have since dropped out, she said. “We were a bad influence on each other,” she said. “If one of us wasn’t in the mood to go to class, we’d all leave. We pushed each other to do the wrong thing. ” In March 2014, Ms. Vazquez’s mother  —   enraged by the discovery of what her daughter had been doing  —   spoke with administrators at the school, who suggested that her daughter enroll at Leadership. Ms. Vasquez, nervous about again switching schools, did not want to go, but when she arrived, she immediately found a support system there. Classes were small, with 20 to 25 students, allowing a nurturing,   learning environment. Students are on a   basis with all the teachers, including the principal. “Respect can be calling someone by their last name, but sometimes when you call someone by their first name, you feel like maybe you’re on a different level,” Stacey Fischler, the school’s program director, said. Students have access to advocate counselors, who are similar to social workers and help them with issues beyond academics, sometimes referring them to mental health services or youth shelters. Each counselor, assigned to 40 to 50 students, is tasked  —   to the point of pestering  —   with making sure they all go to school. “My priority is to make sure you get your education,” said Heather Hansen, a counselor. “Whether that is going to your house and knocking down your door or calling you like a lunatic all day or bothering your parents. That’s my goal. ” Ms. Vazquez smiled as she scrolled through those daily morning texts. At 6:25 a. m. on Nov. 2: “Rise  Shine Scholars. The grind continues. ” Two days later, at 6:44 a. m.: “Rise  Shine #TGIF. ” “I don’t think they sleep,” Ms. Vazquez said, laughing. “It’s a very supportive school. ” More than 14, 000 students attended transfer schools in New York City as of the   school year, the latest for which the Department of Education provided data.   graduation rates for the schools are much lower than the overall rate for New York City public schools, which increased in recent years to 70. 5 percent in 2015. Although the class of 2015 at Leadership had a 5. 6 percent   graduation rate, that rate improves over additional years  —   typical of many transfer schools. About a quarter of students graduate within six years, according to Department of Education data. Despite lower rates, the schools are serving students who may have otherwise dropped out, never receiving a diploma. “You’re working with a population that can be changed, that does need help and doesn’t get targeted often,” Ms. Hansen said. “You’re working with a population that is getting a second chance. And it’s nice to be able to give that. At the end of the day, it can be frustrating and taxing, but you get to see them walk across the stage, and that’s the main goal. ” For Mr. Bright, graduation day seemed unlikely two years ago. In spring 2014, he fell behind again, started ditching classes and almost dropped out. That August, when he was standing on a street corner in   a car passed by. Shots rang out, hitting him in the abdomen. Members of his family and of the Leadership staff surrounded his hospital bed. “There’s a lot of love there,” he said. He returned to school with renewed commitment. The Leadership family also kept Ms. Vazquez in school. “I have good friends and a good support system when I get to school every morning,” she said. “I didn’t think I’d get this far. But now I see a difference in myself, in how I react and how I say and do things. I’ve become a totally different person, and a lot of it comes from this school. ” Both Mr. Bright and Ms. Vazquez are looking forward to graduation. Mr. Bright, who will turn 22 this month, is allowed to finish this school year before he ages out of the public school system. He needs to pass one more Regents exam, for algebra, his most dreaded subject. So Brooklyn Community Services has allocated $500 in Neediest Cases funds to provide him with    tutoring. More than   of Leadership students, including Mr. Bright and Ms. Vazquez, participate in an     program. They have paid internships at places including Burlington Coat Factory, child care centers and the Brooklyn Veterinary Group. Last semester, Ms. Vazquez, 20, received an internship at 3 Black Cats Café and Cakery in Brooklyn, where she worked in the kitchen. It was the first job, Ms. Vazquez said, that she took pride in. “To bake something from scratch and perfect it,” she said. “Knowing that it represents your work, that is new for me. ” The internship ended in November, but she hopes to work at another restaurant. Her love for cooking started in her grandmother’s kitchen. They followed traditional Puerto Rican recipes, including pasteles, a dish of plantains, meat and olives. Now she cooks to remember her grandmother, who died last spring. After graduation in March, she hopes to continue her passion and has applied to culinary schools in upstate New York. When she talked to her grandmother about graduation, her grandmother would say, “Vamos a ver”  —   she would believe it when she saw it. “And now she’ll see,” Ms. Vazquez said with a smile."
Airstrikes by Russia Buttress Turkey in Battle vs. ISIS - The New York Times,New York Times,Michael R. Gordon and Eric Schmitt,2017-01-09,"WASHINGTON  —   Russian warplanes have carried out airstrikes to support Turkey’s offensive in northern Syria against the Islamic State, an important evolution in a budding   partnership. The deepening ties threaten to marginalize the United States in the struggle to shape Syria’s ultimate fate. The air missions, which took place for about a week near the strategically important town of Al Bab, represent the Kremlin’s first use of its military might to help the Turks in their fight against the militant group. The Russians seized an opening to try to build a military relationship with Turkey, a NATO member, as the United States has sought to keep the emphasis on taking Raqqa, the Islamic State’s   capital. The Russian bombing is a remarkable turnabout from November 2015, when a Turkish   fighter jet shot down a Russian   attack plane that had violated Turkey’s airspace. Russia and Turkey had already been involved in a joint effort to establish a   in Syria  —   one that does not involve the United States. At the same time, ties between the United States and Turkey have come under growing strain as the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has become increasingly alarmed about the Kurdish forces known as the Y. P. G. The United States has aligned itself with those forces to combat the Islamic State in Syria. Some analysts say Russia appears to have arrived at an accommodation in which the Turks are moving to establish a security zone in northern Syria to preclude Syrian Kurds from setting up an autonomous region. In return, the Turks appear to be backing off their efforts to unseat President Bashar   of Syria, who, with Russian help, is strengthening his hold on the country’s major cities to the south. “The   rapprochement is largely tactical,” said James F. Jeffrey, a former United States ambassador to Turkey. “Russia can live for now with a Turkish enclave in northern Syria if it does not threaten the Assad regime. And it allows Russia to exploit the U. S. shift to Turkey’s rival, the Y. P. G. by providing air support to the Turks against the Islamic State, which the U. S. inexplicably is not providing. ”   Donald J. Trump has spoken positively, though in vague terms, about the possibility of cooperating with Russia in the fight against the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. But the Obama administration’s efforts to forge a common political and military strategy with the Kremlin on Syria collapsed after Russia supported Syrian forces and   fighters with its air power in the brutal retaking of Aleppo. Turkey began the operation at Al Bab, east of Aleppo, without coordinating with the United States and without the benefit of American airstrikes. “This is something that they’ve decided to do independently,” Col. John Dorrian, the spokesman for the   operation against the Islamic State, said in November. Turkey appeared to have assumed that it would make short work of the Islamic State fighters there. But the fighting has been stiff. In late November, the Turkish military’s problems were compounded when three of its soldiers were killed in what Turkish forces said was a Syrian airstrike. Mr. Erdogan later spoke by phone with Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president, who assured him that Russia had not been involved in the air attack, according to Turkish news reports. The improving ties between the two autocratic leaders opened the door to greater cooperation. The Turkish military spoke publicly about the Russian role in a Jan. 2 statement that noted that Russian warplanes had struck targets the previous day about five miles south of Al Bab. American officials, who asked not to be identified because they were discussing intelligence, said that Russian airstrikes in the Al Bab area began at the end of December, and that Russian aircraft were flying near Al Bab as recently as Friday. The effectiveness of the Russian air operations, which have mainly involved dropping “dumb,” or unguided, bombs, is unclear. As Turkey’s casualties have mounted in the Al Bab operation, Turkish officials have complained about the lack of American air support and have even made veiled threats that Turkey might suspend allied combat flights against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria from its major base at Incirlik, which would be a major blow to the   air campaign. American officials suggested that the holdup in carrying out allied airstrikes in recent weeks was related to a Turkish decision to ban the Americans from flying reconnaissance drones in and around Al Bab to help identify and confirm targets, as well as bad weather. The Turkish military said that measure was needed to ensure that no potentially hostile aircraft flew over its troops, but it has hampered the United States’ ability to carry out airstrikes without endangering civilians. Operating without the benefit of precise intelligence, the United States recently engaged in what officials called a “show of force” operation in which American aircraft flew low over Al Bab and dropped flares. But last week, the Turks agreed that the United States could fly drones and other aircraft to gather intelligence, which paves the way for the   coalition to carry out airstrikes against the Islamic State in Al Bab, American officials said. The United States regards the Kurdish forces as some of the most effective fighters in the campaign against the Islamic State in Syria. But in deference to Turkish sensitivities, the Americans have declined to arm them directly. The Turks, however, regard them as nothing more than an arm of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, an insurgent Kurdish group in Turkey and Iraq. The Turks have blamed the group for killing dozens of Turkish security forces in recent weeks. By any measure, the nascent cooperation between Russia and Turkey is a striking development. The situation was far different when Russian warplanes arrived at Latakia, Syria, in September 2015 to help the Assad government take on rebel groups, including some backed by the United States and Turkey. Relations were thrown into a crisis after a Turkish fighter jet shot down a Russian   attack plane and the Russian pilot was fatally shot by Syrian rebels as he was parachuting down. Mr. Putin denounced the   as a “stab in the back. ” Russia responded by deploying the   an advanced   system, at Latakia, and imposed economic sanctions against Turkey. But over the past year, the calculations of the two countries have changed. While President Obama warned that Syria would become a Russian military “quagmire,” the Russians, working with Iran,   forces and the Syrian military, helped Mr. Assad take back Aleppo in the waning months of the Obama administration without substantial Russian casualties. Still, Russia has to reckon with the fact that the Syrian military lacks the troops to control all of the country. At the same time, Turkey’s immediate objectives have shifted. Worried about the possibility that Kurdish fighters might link up separate cantons to establish an autonomous enclave across northern Syria, as well as about the presence of Islamic State fighters near its borders, Turkey sent its own forces into northern Syria in August. The Turkish offensive, which has enlisted the support of Syrian opposition groups that Turkey has backed, succeeded in taking the town of Jarabulus. But it has become bogged down near Al Bab, the last major town west of Raqqa still held by the Islamic State. The Russians notified the United States about the flights using a special hotline between Russian forces in Syria and the American air war command at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar. The hotline’s goal is to “deconflict” air missions carried out by the Russians and the   coalition."

"In Election Hacking, Julian Assange’s Years-Old Vision Becomes Reality - The New York Times",New York Times,Jim Rutenberg,2017-01-09,"At first blush, there’s a baffling,   quality to Julian Assange’s latest star turn in our shambolic national story. He belongs in jail for “waging his war” against the United States by exposing its secrets, the conservative Fox News host Sean Hannity has said of him. An “  operative with blood on his hands,” Sarah Palin once called him. Yet last week brought the sight of Mr. Hannity speaking with Mr. Assange in glowing terms about “what drives him to expose government and media corruption” through Clinton campaign hacks that American intelligence has attributed to Russia. And Ms. Palin hailed him as a great truth teller, even apologizing for previous unpleasantries. (Cue sound of needle sliding across record album.) O. K. the fact that WikiLeaks’   splash was bad for the Democrats and good for   Donald J. Trump may have a   bit to do with their change of heart. But what’s up with Mr. Assange, who seems equally comfortable being a hero of the American left as he is being one of the American right, or even of Russian Putinists? What does he want, anyway? The answer has been in front of us all along. And the current imbroglio over Russia, WikiLeaks and their role in Mr. Trump’s victory  —   or, more to the point, Hillary Clinton’s loss  —   might be viewed as the realization of the vision Mr. Assange had when he started WikiLeaks over a decade ago. Mr. Assange spelled it out in prescient terms in an essay he posted online in November of 2006, the year of WikiLeaks’ founding. He wrote it long before becoming the polarizing figure he is today, a “cypherpunk” folk hero with an outsize reputation for being messianic, impetuous and all too cavalier with the personal data that come his way. (He’s currently living in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London, where he was granted asylum from Swedish authorities who are investigating a rape accusation against him that he says is false and politically motivated.) Yet even his toughest critics acknowledge how clearly he saw the politically disruptive potential of technology, back when some of us were getting our first BlackBerries. It’s what prompted him to start WikiLeaks, which “pioneered something extremely important and very dangerous to large organizations that keep lots of secrets digitally,” as the journalist Glenn Greenwald told me in an interview last week. From the start, Mr. Assange said WikiLeaks’ prime directive was to expose hidden data sets that “reveal illegal or immoral behavior” in government and big business. But in the essay he also wrote in more ambitious terms about forcing regime change through data and technology rather than through the old, barbaric means of assassination. As Mr. Assange saw it, power was held by vast networks of conspirators who shared vital information in secret, giving them a superior understanding of reality that enabled them to hold on to power. The technology revolution, he wrote, was providing the conspirators with the means to achieve what he called an even “higher total conspiratorial power. ” But it was also making them more vulnerable to sabotage, so that a governing conspiracy could be “slowed until it falls, stupefied unable to comprehend and control the forces in its environment. ” As an example, he pointed to “two closely balanced and broadly conspiratorial power groupings,” the Democratic and the Republican Parties in the United States. “Consider what would happen if one of these parties gave up their mobile phones, fax and email correspondence  —   let alone the computer systems,” he wrote. “They would immediately fall into an organizational stupor and lose to the other. ” The essay got new attention when WikiLeaks, working in tandem with The Guardian, The New York Times and other outlets, released extensive diplomatic cables in 2010, making WikiLeaks more of a household name. No one seemed to grasp what Mr. Assange was hinting at more clearly than the conservative writer John Sexton, who foresaw the events of 2016 in a post that was published on Breitbart News and his own blogin 2010. “You can take his example further by imagining what would happen to, say, the D. N. C. if it suffered a massive Wikileak of secret data,” Mr. Sexton wrote, referring to Mr. Assange’s essay. “It seems entirely possible that a leak of the contents of their email for one month would be exceedingly damaging to them. ” And here we are, over six years later. Mr. Assange’s essay has resurfaced yet again, after major data breaches of the email accounts of the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton adviser John Podesta, committed, allegedly, by   hackers and fed to the world via WikiLeaks. Clinton aides have said the breach impeded their ability to communicate electronically afterward, causing them to resort to holding more   meetings. But far more damaging were the spilled secrets. They forced the resignations of the Democratic National Committee chairwoman, Debbie   and of the interim chair, Donna Brazile, from her analyst job at CNN. And they provided Mr. Trump with a steady stream of fresh,   data points, which WikiLeaks fed out incrementally, creating a running story that the American news media voraciously seized upon. Political scientists will debate for years to come how decisive the leaks were in the election outcome. But the emails were undeniably in the mix of an election decided by fewer than 100, 000 votes in three key swing states. So, in the end, one political party was technologically compromised in a way the other wasn’t, and that party did indeed “lose to the other. ” It’s a straight line from Mr. Assange’s initial essay. But if WikiLeaks’ disclosures abetted Mr. Trump, how does that square with Mr. Assange’s goals to undercut “authoritarian conspirators” and create incentives for “more humane forms of governance”? Mr. Trump was less transparent than Mrs. Clinton was during the campaign (we’re still waiting for those tax returns) and he made a number of   statements (“lock her up! ”) that were unique to modern American politics. A WikiLeaks journalist, Sarah Harrison, recently wrote in The Times that WikiLeaks was a news organization committed to disclosing vital information, not picking political sides. Mr. Assange addressed the question differently in an interview last month with the Italian journalist Stefania Maurizi of La Repubblica. “Hillary Clinton’s election would have been a consolidation of power in the existing ruling class of the United States,” he said. Mr. Trump and his allies, he said, “do not by themselves form an existing structure, so it is a weak structure which is displacing and destabilizing the   central power network within D. C. ” That, he said, could herald change, both good and bad. A weak power network in Washington, of course, is just what President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia wanted to see, too. Given Russia’s own authoritarianism and opacity  —   try independent journalism there, if you dare  —   it’s a wonder and, for some, cause for suspicion that it’s not a bigger WikiLeaks target. Mr. Assange told Repubblica that while he had released plenty of   documents, WikiLeaks has no staff members who speak Russian. And he told my Times colleagues Jo Becker, Steven Erlanger and Eric Schmitt last summer that Russia was “a bit player” on the world stage compared with the United States and China. (Their article showed how WikiLeaks’ releases often benefited Russia at the expense of the West despite American assessments that it is likely not directly tied to Russian intelligence services). Though Mr. Assange does not as a rule reveal sources, he has repeatedly said he is confident that the Clinton campaign and D. N. C. email caches that WikiLeaks received did not come from a “state party. ” He maintains that the United States has failed to offer conclusive proof of the Russian government’s direct role, and he is not alone. On Friday, The Intercept, a news outlet   by Mr. Greenwald  —   who led the Guardian team that shared a Pulitzer Prize in 2014 with The Washington Post for coverage of Edward Snowden’s revelations on mass surveillance  —   declared the intelligence report “underwhelming. ” Mr. Greenwald has been highly critical of mainstream news reports that, in his view, have been too quick to accept intelligence reports pointing to Russia’s role. That has added to the fun house mirror aspect of the latest Assange turn, given that Mr. Greenwald’s past work was celebrated by people who are so solidly opposed to Mr. Trump now. But Mr. Greenwald has long criticized mainstream American journalists as being too credulous with government intelligence claims (see “weapons of mass destruction”). Unlike, perhaps, Mr. Hannity and Ms. Palin, he is being consistent. “What’s changed is the political earth around me,” he said. “And the same thing has happened to Julian. ” That earth is still shifting. Where Mr. Assange turns up on it next is anyone’s guess."
Data Could Be the Next Tech Hot Button for Regulators - The New York Times,New York Times,Steve Lohr,2017-01-09,"Wealth and influence in the technology business have always been about gaining the upper hand in software or the machines that software ran on. Now data  —   gathered in those immense pools of information that are at the heart of everything from artificial intelligence to online shopping recommendations  —   is increasingly a focus of technology competition. And academics and some policy makers, especially in Europe, are considering whether big internet companies like Google and Facebook might use their data resources as a barrier to new entrants and innovation. In recent years, Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Microsoft have all been targets of tax evasion, privacy or antitrust investigations. But in the coming years, who controls what data could be the next worldwide regulatory focus as governments strain to understand and sometimes rein in American tech giants. The European Commission and the British House of Lords both issued reports last year on digital “platform” companies that highlighted the essential role that data collection, analysis and distribution play in creating and shaping markets. And the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development held a meeting in November to explore the subject, “Big Data: Bringing Competition Policy to the Digital Era. ” As government regulators dig into this new era of data competition, they may find that standard antitrust arguments are not so easy to make. Using more and more data to improve a service for users and more accurately target ads for merchants is a clear benefit, for example. And higher prices for consumers are not present with free internet services. “You certainly don’t want to punish companies because of what they might do,” said Annabelle Gawer, a professor of the digital economy at the University of Surrey in England, who made a presentation at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development meeting. “But you do need to be vigilant. It’s clear that enormous power is in the hands of a few companies. ” Maurice Stucke, a former Justice Department antitrust official and a professor at the University of Tennessee College of Law, who also spoke at the gathering, said one danger was that consumers might be afforded less privacy than they would choose in a more competitive market. The competition concerns echo those that gradually emerged in the 1990s about software and Microsoft. The worry is that as the big internet companies attract more users and advertisers, and gather more data, a powerful “network effect” effectively prevents users and advertisers from moving away from a dominant digital platform, like Google in search or Facebook in consumer social networks. Evidence of the rising importance of data can be seen from the frontiers of artificial intelligence to mainstream business software. And certain data sets can be remarkably valuable for companies working on those technologies. A prime example is Microsoft’s purchase of LinkedIn, the business social network, for $26. 2 billion last year. LinkedIn has about 467 million members, and it houses their profiles and maps their connections. Microsoft is betting LinkedIn, combined with data on how hundreds of millions of workers use its Office 365 online software, and consumer data from search behavior on Bing, will “power a set of insights that we think is unprecedented,” said James Phillips, vice president for business applications at Microsoft. In an email to employees, Satya Nadella, Microsoft’s chief executive, described the LinkedIn deal as a linchpin in the company’s   goal to “reinvent productivity and business processes” and to become the digital marketplace that defines “how people find jobs, build skills, sell, market and get work done. ” IBM has also bet heavily on data for its future. Its acquisitions have tended to be in specific industries, like its $2. 6 billion purchase last year of Truven Health, which has data on the cost and treatment of more than 200 million patients, or in specialized data sets useful across several industries, like its $2 billion acquisition of the digital assets of the Weather Company. IBM estimates that 70 percent of the world’s data is not out on the public web, but in private databases, often to protect privacy or trade secrets. IBM’s strategy is to take the data it has acquired, add customer data and use that to train its Watson artificial intelligence software to pursue such tasks as helping medical researchers discover novel disease therapies, or flagging suspect financial transactions for independent auditors. “Our focus is mainly on nonpublic data sets and extending that advantage for clients in business and science,” said David Kenny, senior vice president for IBM’s Watson and cloud businesses. At Google, the company’s drive into   business software is fueled by data, building on years of work done on its search and other consumer services, and its recent advances in image identification, speech recognition and language translation. For example, a new Google business offering  —   still in the test, or alpha, stage  —   is a software service to improve job finding and recruiting. Its data includes more than 17 million online job postings and the public profiles and résumés of more than 200 million people. Its   algorithms distilled that to about four million unique job titles, ranked the most common ones and identified specific skills. The job sites CareerBuilder and Dice are using the Google technology to show job seekers more relevant openings. And FedEx, the giant package shipper, is adding the service to its recruiting site. That is just one case, said Diane Greene, senior vice president for Google’s cloud business, of what is becoming increasingly possible  —   using the tools of artificial intelligence, notably machine learning, to sift through huge quantities of data to provide   data services. “You can turn this technology to whatever field you want, from manufacturing to medicine,” Ms. Greene said.   Li, director of the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, is taking a sabbatical to become chief scientist for artificial intelligence at Google’s cloud unit. She sees working at Google as one path to pursue her career ambition to “democratize A. I.,” now that the software and data ingredients are ripe. “We wouldn’t have the current era of A. I. without the big data revolution,” Dr. Li said. “It’s the digital gold. ” In the A. I. race, better software algorithms can put you ahead for a year or so, but probably no more, said Andrew Ng, a former Google scientist and adjunct professor at Stanford. He is now chief scientist at Baidu, the Chinese internet search giant, and a leading figure in artificial intelligence research. Rivals, he added, cannot unlock or simulate your data. “Data is the defensible barrier, not algorithms,” Mr. Ng said."
Russian Hackers Find Ready Bullhorns in the Media - The New York Times,New York Times,Max Fisher,2017-01-13,"As the dust settles on Russian interference in the United States election, journalists are confronting an aspect that has received less scrutiny than the hacking itself but poses its own thorny questions: Moscow’s ability to steer Western media coverage by doling out hacked documents. Reporters have always relied on sources who provide critical information for   reasons. The duty, tricky but familiar, is to publicize information that serves the public interest without falling prey to the source’s agenda. But in this case, the source was Russia’s military intelligence agency, the G. R. U.  —   operating through shadowy fronts who worked to mask that fact  —   and its agenda was to undermine the American presidential election. By releasing documents that would tarnish Hillary Clinton and other American political figures, but whose news value compelled coverage, Moscow exploited the very openness that is the basis of a free press. Its tactics have evolved with each such operation, some of which are still unfolding. Thomas Rid, a professor of security studies at King’s College London who is tracking the Russian influence campaign, said it goes well beyond hacking: “It’s political engineering, social engineering on a strategic level. ” Great powers have long meddled in one another’s affairs. But Russia, throughout 2016, developed a previously unseen tactic: setting up fronts to seed into the press documents it had obtained by hacking. “Doing public relations work in order to get the hacked material out as an exclusive story with the Daily Caller or Gawker or the Smoking Gun, that is new,” Mr. Rid said. That public relations work was initially done by two web presences that appeared this summer, Guccifer 2. 0 and DCLeaks, each posing as   in the mold of Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks chief. Though neither acknowledged it, and the links were not immediately known, online security experts later concluded that both were Russian fronts. Guccifer 2. 0 claimed to be a Romanian ”freedom fighter” who had hacked the Democratic National Committee. Using Twitter’s private message service, the account conducted weekslong exchanges with journalists, pointing them to certain documents that had been hacked from the D. N. C. and other targets. “Whoever is doing this understands media. They understand the way that media works and how to manipulate media,” said Sheera Frenkel, a BuzzFeed News reporter who interacted with the fronts throughout the summer. DCLeaks, established separately and with its own sets of hacked documents, claimed to be “launched by the American hacktivists who respect and appreciate freedom of speech. ” The fronts sold the act by peppering their messages with slang and emojis. When Ms. Frenkel asked Guccifer whether it would release more D. N. C. documents, the reply came, “Yeah baby :)” Journalists who interacted with the accounts say their tone and facility with English varied widely, suggesting each was run by multiple users. A reporter with Motherboard, a technology site, quizzed Guccifer on the technical aspects of the hacking and on rudimentary Romanian. Guccifer failed both, lending credence to theories that it was a front. Those suspicions were initially restricted to security experts, trickling out only after firms such as ThreatConnect were able to unmask the fronts in detailed reports. In July, for instance, DCLeaks published emails belonging to retired Air Force Gen. Philip Breedlove. The Intercept, a   site, covered the emails in a story that portrayed Mr. Breedlove as trying to foment hostility against Russia. The story did not note Russian links to the hack. Its lead author, Lee Fang, said he had no interactions with DCLeaks and pointed out that the group’s suspected Russian ties were not widely publicized at that time. Some reporters were offered documents exclusively, a familiar tactic of government press offices and public relations firms that want to shape coverage. In September, DCLeaks contacted Peter Hasson, a reporter at the Daily Caller, a   site, with an offer:   access to hacked emails belonging to Colin Powell, the former secretary of state. The Daily Caller’s story also did not note the growing belief that the documents had been hacked by Russia and leaked as part of an influence operation. Mr. Hasson said he was unaware of the alleged Russian links at the time. After awareness grew, the front organizations dropped the pretense. The newest group called itself Fancy Bears Hack Team  —   a breathtakingly overt reference to “fancy bear,” the name that some Western security groups use for G. R. U. hackers. Tom Cheshire, a reporter with the British network Sky News who has dealt with Fancy Bears, said they behaved “almost more like a P. R. firm, really” and were “very businesslike,” doling out scoops and trying to shape coverage. “It’s the sort of horse trading you do with all sorts of sources, really,” Mr. Cheshire said, hitting on a key to the operation’s impact: the way that it played within the bounds of established journalistic norms. Any leak by any source  —   Russian agent or citizen    —   poses a similar set of quandaries for reporters. Do you emphasize the hacking itself in your coverage, knowing that this will undercut the source’s agenda but could also be a disservice to readers by putting less focus on newsworthy information in the release? Do you withhold newsworthy documents, even only temporarily, to check their veracity and provenance? What if they have already been reported by other outlets that were shown the documents first? If they did turn out to be hacked as part of a hostile foreign operation, does that really make their contents less newsworthy? These are old questions for journalists, but they have taken on new urgency with the scale of Russia’s hackings and aims. Though the calculus of reporting on   leaks may be familiar, one aspect of the Russian operation stands out: the lengths to which the fronts go to mask their identities and motives. Because the internet gives any outlet the potential to reach millions, all it takes is one   leak to send the document flying across the web. Last year,   hackers infiltrated the United States   Agency, most likely in retaliation for accusations of   doping among Russia’s Olympic athletes. But Fancy Bears struggled to place the stolen documents with American or British outlets. Reporters who saw the files said their news value did not outweigh the risk of serving Russian interests. When Fancy Bears offered the files to The Associated Press, the reporters instead published a story on the   group itself. Fancy Bears ultimately persuaded sportswriters with Spiegel, a prominent German outlet, to report on emails that appeared to show American athletes requesting medical exceptions to take restricted drugs. The article noted a possible Russian link only in the final lines, alongside a quote from an American official arguing that the leak was intended to distract from   doping. If mainstream outlets pass on a hacking,   fronts can always pass the documents to peripheral outfits who will lend them less weight but can still send them across social media. That has often included the website InfoWars, which was founded by the   radio host Alex Jones and often publishes conspiracy theories. Guccifer 2. 0 approached Mikael Thalen, a writer for InfoWars, with D. N. C. documents that showed Democrats’ plans for attacking Paul Manafort, a campaign manager to Donald J. Trump who had worked on behalf of the   Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych, a Kremlin ally. Mr. Thalen had come to believe, after many interactions with the front groups, that they “would reach out based on who would best carry the story the way they wanted it carried. ” He feared that Moscow was hoping InfoWars, by publishing the files, would muddy the water around accusations against Mr. Manafort, indirectly aiding Mr. Trump’s   campaign. Breaking with InfoWars’ usual reliance on such files, he declined to publish the documents. Because everyone has secrets, even if it’s only a few embarrassing personal emails, and because no network is impenetrable, skilled hackers can dig up compromising material on virtually any target. Democracies, which give privilege to competitive politics and free media, are particularly susceptible. “An open society is by choice more vulnerable than a closed society to some form of influence operation,” said Mr. Rid. “That is why we’re strong, but it’s also why we’re weak. ” The more that journalists and readers understand the motivations of foreign government leakers, he argued, the better they will be able to place those leaks in context, undercutting the hackers’ agenda without hiding newsworthy information. He compared this to a healthy body developing antibodies against a disease  —   foreign influence operations  —   that cannot be wholly immunized against while maintaining democratic openness. Still, some media trends  —   polarization, fake news, the   nature of social media  —   cut against those hopes. “This polarized election presented itself as a target of opportunity of the first order,” Mr. Rid said. Reporters may at times be hindered by a lack of transparency between media organizations, which are often highly competitive and prize speed and scoops. This has left reporters vulnerable because they cannot easily pool lessons on spotting foreign operations or, say, warn one another that a certain front is exaggerating the newsworthiness of its latest leak. “The more light shone on this, the more information you have when dealing with a source, the better decisions you’re going to make,” Mr. Cheshire said. Mr. Thalen, the InfoWars reporter, said he was increasingly turning down leaks that he knows his audience would read avidly and reward with acclaim, but that he considered exaggerated to advance Russian interests. Still, he was unsure it had made much difference. “A lot of people have swayed their reporting with their biases, and I didn’t want to do that,” he said. “People are believing what they want to be true. ”"
‘What’s the Big Deal?’ Ask Trump Voters on Russia Hacking Report - The New York Times,New York Times,Campbell Robertson and Mitch Smith,2017-01-08,"COVINGTON, La.  —   “Sour grapes,” explained Bob Marino, 79, weighing in on the recent spycraft bombshell from the corner table of a local McDonald’s. “Sour grapes,” agreed Roger Noel, 65, sitting next to him. “Bunch of crybabies,” Reed Guidry, 64, offered from across the table. The subject of conversation was the report released by United States intelligence chiefs on Friday informing   Donald J. Trump of their unanimous conclusion that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia ordered an extensive, but covert, cyberoperation to help Mr. Trump win the election. The Russians had hacked and leaked emails, unleashed “trolls” on social media and used their “  propaganda machine” to spread stories harmful to Hillary Clinton. In Washington, the report was viewed as extraordinary, both for its timing, raising sharp questions about the  ’s legitimacy on the verge of his taking office, and for its assertions, describing the operation as Russia’s boldest effort yet to meddle with American elections, to spread discontent and to “undermine the U. S.  democratic order. ” But interviews with Trump supporters here in Louisiana, a state the   won by 20 points, and in Indiana, a state he won by nearly the same margin, found opinions about the report that ranged from general indifference to outright derision. “From the parts of the report I’ve seen,” said Rob Maness, a retired Air Force colonel who twice ran for Senate here as Tea Party favorite, “it seems silly. ” There are genuine concerns about Russia’s cyberoperations, he said, but the notion that they changed the outcome of the election was absurd. (The report made no determination on how they affected the election.) Of the comments he had seen from fellow Trump supporters on Facebook and in emails, he added, “90 percent of them are like, ‘What’s the big deal? ’” The Russians may have very well gotten involved, several people said. They added that kind of interference should be combated. But many assumed that foreign actors had long tried to play favorites in American elections, and that the United States had done the same in other countries’ elections. Even if the Russians did do it  —   which some were more willing to concede than others  —   what difference did it make? People did not need the Russians to make up their minds about Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Trump’s election opponent. Blaming her loss on the Russians was, as one Trump supporter here said, “just being sore losers. ” “I don’t think the Russians posed as big a problem to the Clintons as the Clintons posed to themselves,” said Paul Emenes, 49, while he sold ribs, shoulders and chops at a frigid outdoor farmers’ market in Covington. Russian hacking was concerning, sure, Mr. Emenes said. He added that, as long as Mr. Trump was not involved himself, “it doesn’t change the way I view him. ” Tina Gunaldo, 44, taking blankets off the citrus trees in her Mandeville, La. front yard after the previous night’s frost, had a similar attitude. “Trump is Trump,” she said. “Do I think he’s going to become more of a friend to Russia because of this? No I don’t. I think  —   I hope  —   his focus will be on making America great again. ” Ms. Gunaldo would not reveal whom she voted for, but she did say Mr. Trump’s slogan resonated with her. It apparently resonated quite widely in this parish, which he won by more than 50 points. But it was a quiet support, she said. She knew of only one yard in the whole subdivision with a sign. That yard belonged to Thurston Yates Sr. “I don’t believe it,” Mr. Yates, 78, said flatly of the intelligence report. He was standing in the yard under his “Make America Great Again” flag, which he bought at a gun show several months ago. “Why would Putin even want Trump?” Mr. Yates, who is retired from a career in pharmaceutical sales, was not concerned about what Mr. Trump might do in office, but said he was deeply alarmed about what President Obama might do before he leaves office. It was Mr. Obama who was too soft on Russia, who let Mr. Putin get away with things, Mr. Yates continued. Mr. Trump would be much tougher. But Mr. Yates then added: “Why is everybody so afraid of Russia? I’m not against Putin. ” This last sentiment was not uncommon. Even among those who were troubled by the hacks, few felt that Russia was a serious threat. The country was “a basket case,” and not the powerful foe it once was, said Mr. Marino, from his seat at McDonald’s. Others said that North Korea, the Islamic State and China were the real threats. Russia could even be a potential ally in some fights, suggested Valarie Kubacki, 54, a real estate broker in Valparaiso, Ind. Ms. Kubacki said she perceived Russia as “somewhere in the middle” between friend and enemy, but agreed with Mr. Trump that the United States could work with them to defeat the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. “We may have to line up with people who may not be our ‘friend’ to make that happen,” she said. That those on the right seemed to be warming to Russia was not seen as a particularly unusual development, though some joked about the incongruity of the left putting such faith in the Central Intelligence Agency. As they watched their son skate with his Boy Scout group at the public ice rink in downtown Valparaiso, Monty and Mary Willis, both registered Republicans, considered the ramifications of the intelligence report. “The idea of a fair election” had been placed in doubt, Ms. Willis said. “We were concerned about money being involved in the election. Now you’re talking about espionage. ” The Willises, who both work in real estate, might be Republicans, but they were not Trump voters. In fact, they had last voted for a Republican presidential candidate in 2008, when Senator John McCain of Arizona ran. The party seemed to have changed in recent years, they said. And the incoming administration had them deeply worried. “Our president being in cahoots with the Russian government?” Mr. Willis said. “Yes, I’m very concerned about that. ” In Louisiana, David Gubert, 56,   Eagle 20 cigarettes in the cab of his pickup, with stacks of firewood for sale behind him in the bed. Like the Willises, he ruminated on what it would mean if the Russians had gotten involved, and possibly even swung the election. But Mr. Gubert came to a different conclusion. “If that’s what it took,” he said, “I’m glad they did it. ”"
"After Fort Lauderdale Shooting, Rumor of Second Gunman Created Chaos - The New York Times",New York Times,Lizette Alvarez,2017-01-09,"MIAMI  —   By the time Donald Robertson, a retired architect, arrived at Fort   International Airport’s Terminal 1 on Friday afternoon, the mass shooting in Terminal 2, which left five people dead, had been over for at least an hour. The accused gunman, Esteban Santiago, was in police custody and the airport had largely returned to its normal rhythm  —   passengers were noshing, charging their phones, watching television. Things were so sedate that Mr. Robertson did not even realize there had been a shooting. But as he made his way past the gate, Mr. Robertson looked up and saw a “stampede” of people, including what looked like law enforcement agents, racing toward him. “It was tremendous,” he said. “It was like a herd reacting. Everyone around me was diving under chairs. ” A rumor about a possible second gunman had spread across the airport, via social media, news sites and word of mouth. People panicked and the airport was shut down, a turn of events that upended what had seemed like an orderly finale to a tragic afternoon. What followed that single rumor was a rush of terror for travelers and airport workers as they fled to the tarmac, were separated from loved ones, injured themselves in the tumult, hid in kitchens and storage rooms and hunkered down behind luggage trucks. Chaos and uncertainty unfolded over the next 12 hours. Through it all, travelers said, they were frustrated every step of the way by the dearth of information about whether they were safe, where to go once the airport was shut down and how they could retrieve the thousands of items  —   23, 000 according to a tally by airport officials  —   that were scattered across terminals. For the thousands who fled the terminals, seeking refuge on the tarmac or hiding wherever they could, food and water quickly became scarce. Bathrooms were nonexistent. Passengers on some planes that were either preparing to take off or trying to reach a gate were stuck on board for up to seven hours. Travelers said that some level of pandemonium is to be expected after a shooting, and they praised law enforcement for the swift response. But it was the aftermath of the rumor, which was debunked relatively quickly, that left them bewildered and angry. “Nobody gave us information, and as time went on, we were treated more and more like suspects,” Mr. Robertson said, referring to the   by law enforcement and orders for people to raise their hands as they walked from the airport down side roads. “When they decided to clear the terminal  —   that created terror. And it was real terror. People were really, really, really terrified and crying. ” Sheriff Scott Israel of Broward County, Fla. said he issued the order to close the entire airport as a safety precaution after he received information that “perhaps gunfire had happened and an active shooter was in another terminal. ” At that point, he said, the safety of the people at the airport was paramount. “I made a decision to clear the airport,” Sheriff Israel said in an interview. “I worked with our SWAT team and other SWAT teams to clear the entire airport and the parking garage to make sure we didn’t have any other active shooter. It was a voluminous undertaking and we did it, as horrific and horrible as this scene was. ” Until that point, he said, the plan was by the book. “Had the misinformation of the active shooter not surfaced,” he said, “we would have had buses to the airport within 30 minutes. ” Sheriff Israel said he could not remember how long it took to confirm there was no second gunman. The authorities debunked the rumor about 30 to 45 minutes after it had started to spread, raising questions about whether the airport could have been reopened right away. By then, law enforcement was already sweeping the airport and garages. It is still unclear how the rumor began. Several travelers said in interviews that they heard what they believed to be gunshots in Terminal 3, something that sounded like loud pops. Sheriff Israel said that he was told somebody saw a bloody person and assumed a second gunman was loose. Providing accurate information to passengers and airport and airline staff members also proved challenging. Law enforcement typically can access wireless emergency alerts  —   the system that sends Amber Alerts  —   but alerts were not used to inform people that the danger had passed or instruct them on what to do next. Some airports have internal communication systems for employees to send important messages. It is unknown whether this was in place at the Fort Lauderdale airport. Instead, news, accurate and otherwise, traveled through word of mouth or was gleaned from cellphones. “Airports can put out messages to employees, and that is important because passengers will tend to follow directions from uniformed employees in the know,” said Douglas Mansel, the aviation security manager at Oakland International Airport in Oakland, Calif. All airports have emergency plans approved by the Federal Aviation Administration, including for   scenarios. The Fort Lauderdale airport’s director, Mark E. Gale, was not available to comment on airport protocols or on how events unfolded on Friday. Sheriff Israel said that communication proved tricky. With so many people spread out across different areas, including on the tarmac and in garages, it was hard to get information out. “I tried to tell as many people verbally,” he said. “Communication is critical, but there is no way to communicate to thousands. ” Anne Buongiorno, 56, who was visiting from Canada, had to evacuate Terminal 2 twice. The first time, after the shooting, she and her    daughter jumped under a seat, their hands over their heads. Her husband was in the bathroom. Terrified, they followed a surge of people down a staircase, but people were shoving one another. She fell down and broke her rib. She and her daughter ended up on the tarmac and were told to lie on the ground near a luggage truck. A while later, they were told to go back inside. A similar scenario played out as the report spread of the possible second gunman. Ms. Buongiorno said she again wound up among thousands of people on the tarmac. Clusters of people ran back and forth, fleeing what they feared was a threat as the rumor took hold. Ms. Buongiorno hid behind a truck and waited nearly for five hours before being led to a hangar and later put on a bus for the cruise port. Nobody gave her information about where to go, so she used to iPad to find a hotel, got in a long line for a cab and went there. The next day, she was back at the airport waiting for word about how to get her belongings and fly back to Canada. “It was the first time in my life I was so afraid,” she said, her voice quavering at the memory. “I’m afraid still. When I heard somebody talk over there, I’m afraid. ” Others joined the long line of people who were told to walk out of the airport along a set of railroad tracks, which skirted a marshy area. A few who had tried to avoid the mayhem by jumping a fence were confronted by law enforcement officers with pointed guns. Those who had luggage dragged it along. Officers sometimes issued contradictory orders  —   people directed to one location were told by officers there to go back where they came from. Along the way, law enforcement personnel ordered people to raise their arms and sometimes frisked them as they filed by  —   a common precaution, security experts said, but one that alarmed some. “They were patting us down like there was another shooter,” said Melody Dorward, 22, of Ohio, who walked the railroad tracks. “I felt traumatized. Not safe. ”"
Experts Hesitate to Link Florida Airport Attack to PTSD - The New York Times,New York Times,Dave Philipps,2017-01-09,"Family members say that Esteban Santiago, the suspect in the Fort Lauderdale airport shooting in which five people were killed, seemed troubled when he came back from military service in Iraq. His brother described him as “more furious” after his deployment in 2010 with a Puerto Rico National Guard unit. His aunt said that after coming home, Mr. Santiago “lost his mind. ” After Mr. Santiago’s arrest in the shooting, emerging details of his military service led some to blame the rampage on the   mind of a veteran haunted by   stress disorder, a common pattern when veterans are arrested in violent crimes. But experts not connected to Mr. Santiago’s mental health treatment say it may be a mistake to blame PTSD. Mr. Santiago, who served for eight years in the National Guard and Army Reserve and saw combat in Iraq in 2010, exhibited symptoms that do not appear to fit the disorder, they say, and more closely resemble schizophrenia, a condition unrelated to military service. Mr. Santiago’s family said he reported hearing voices and had other hallucinations, but said he was never given a diagnosis of PTSD. In November, he walked into an F. B. I. office in Alaska and told agents that his mind was being controlled by a United States intelligence agency. “The delusions, the hallucinations are far more consistent with psychosis than PTSD,” said Dr. Donald C. Goff, a psychiatrist at New York University and a leading expert on schizophrenia. “So is the timing of the onset. ” Mr. Santiago deployed to Iraq when he was 20 years old, which is the age when many males with schizophrenia begin to exhibit symptoms, Dr. Goff said, cautioning that he could not comment on Mr. Santiago specifically without reviewing his medical records. “Generally, it’s in the first year of college or military service, or some other stressful event, that we see schizophrenia,” he said. “It’s not that deployment is the cause of the psychosis, but the stress may contribute to the symptoms coming out. ” The level of stress Mr. Santiago experienced on deployment is unclear. He went to Iraq with the Puerto Rico National Guard’s 1013th Engineering Company, and was charged with keeping highways clear of roadside bombs. Violence had dropped drastically in the country by 2010 nonetheless, two soldiers in his company were killed by a roadside bomb. After his tour, Mr. Santiago was awarded the Combat Action Badge, which is given only to service members who are actively engaged with the enemy. “There is nothing to say that a person can’t have psychosis and PTSD,” said Claude M. Chemtob, a professor of psychology at New York University who has studied the link between PTSD and aggression. But, he said, the two disorders are characterized by different symptoms. PTSD sufferers can struggle with anxiety, sleeplessness, flashbacks and anger. In rare cases, the disorder results in increased violence and aggressiveness. But paranoid delusions are not typical. “That is a cardinal symptom of psychosis,” Dr. Chemtob said. “But inevitably people’s prejudice toward veterans is going to lead them to emphasize PTSD. ” Veterans have complained that too often they are labeled with the disorder, and that ascribing all violent acts among veterans to the psychological scars of war perpetuates damaging stereotypes. Many have argued that is what happened with Eddie Ray Routh, the    former Marine corporal who killed Chris Kyle, a member of the Navy SEALs and the author of “American Sniper,” in 2013. Mr. Routh’s medical records revealed he had persistent delusions that he was being devoured from the inside by parasites, and that his   were pig people who wanted to eat him, but a doctor at a veterans hospital gave him a diagnosis of PTSD. Veterans have struggled with the reputation for being dangerously unstable since at least the Vietnam War. The stigma was stoked in part by Hollywood narratives like “Rambo,” and is still pervasive today, said Bill Rausch, the executive director of Got Your 6, a nonprofit group that tracks the public image of veterans. According to a survey by the group in 2016, 83 percent of respondents said they believed veterans were more likely to have mental health problems. Respondents also said they thought veterans were more likely to be unemployed and abuse drugs. In fact, in terms of employment and drug use, the opposite is true. “The public sees veterans as broken, and they often shape the narrative to fit their perceptions,” Mr. Rausch said. When the news of the Fort Lauderdale shooting broke, he said: “My first thought was that I hoped no one was hurt. My second was that I hoped it wasn’t a veteran because I knew if they were, it would spark a simplified explanation that would never happen with a civilian, tying everything back to war. ” After telling the F. B. I. in November that his mind was being controlled, Mr. Santiago was taken to a civilian psychiatric hospital. The law prevents patients from being held involuntarily if they are not an imminent threat to themselves or others. Mr. Santiago was released after four days. “Anyone who has ever known someone with mental illness knows it’s extremely complicated and hard to deal with,” Mr. Rausch said. “Blaming on military experience keeps us from having a real conversation about how to fix things. This isn’t a veteran problem, it’s an American problem. ”"
"At Dylann Roof’s Trial, a Question of How Many Tears Are Too Many - The New York Times",New York Times,Kevin Sack and Alan Blinder,2017-01-09,"CHARLESTON, S. C.  —   The federal trial to determine whether Dylann S. Roof will receive the death penalty for his murderous rampage at an   church has become a delicate balancing act, pitting the desire of prosecutors to convey the fullness of grief for the nine devout victims against the due process rights of an unrepentant white supremacist who largely declines to defend himself. In three days of   testimony last week, prosecutors questioned 20 spouses, children, grandchildren and friends of the victims to draw painfully poignant portraits of men and women who were pillars of their church, families and community. Jurors heard not only the tributes of the bereaved but in some cases the voices of the dead  —   recordings of the Rev. Clementa C. Pinckney lecturing proudly about the   history of Emanuel A. M. E. Church, the Rev. DePayne Middleton Doctor booming a soulful a cappella solo, the Rev. Sharonda   praying in a crescendo at the funeral of a friend. The government’s lawyers called two or three witnesses to render a portrait of each victim testimony about one of the deceased  —   the youngest,    Tywanza Sanders  —   remains for Monday. The prosecution plans to rest its case that day, and Mr. Roof, who is representing himself, has said he will not call any witnesses. Closing arguments are expected on Tuesday. Mr. Roof, 22, stared straight ahead or down at the defense table, avoiding eye contact with witnesses who lost composure on the stand and jurors who sometimes dabbed away tears. When a prosecutor would conclude his gentle questioning, which could draw on for more than an hour, Judge Richard M. Gergel of Federal District Court would call for  . Mr. Roof, dressed in a   sweater and slacks, would rise slightly from his seat and announce: “No questions. ” That dynamic has prompted a series of challenges by Mr. Roof, and pointed exchanges between Judge Gergel and David I. Bruck, the veteran,   capital defender whom Mr. Roof has sidelined, about how much is too much. “It is not fair to allow that much testimony to be heard by the jury when I am not presenting any evidence  —   from my family or anyone else  —   in mitigation,” Mr. Roof argued on Wednesday in a motion that Judge Gergel denied. “If I don’t present any mitigation evidence, the   evidence will take over the whole sentencing trial and guarantee that I get the death penalty. ” Found guilty in December on 33 counts, including 18 that carry a potential death sentence, Mr. Roof has rejected Mr. Bruck’s strategy of presenting evidence about his background and mental health that might mitigate against his execution. The lawyer has been relegated to the role of standby counsel, allowed to sit beside Mr. Roof and offer guidance but not to question witnesses or to object to the government’s evidence. The usually   Mr. Bruck has not been able to contain his frustration. At several points last week, with the jury out of the courtroom, he pleaded with Judge Gergel to rein in the prosecution and to empower him to object to testimony. “This is sentencing it is not a memorial service,” said Mr. Bruck, who has often expressed his admiration for the victims and his sorrow for their families. “It has become a runaway freight train. ” Mr. Bruck told Judge Gergel that Mr. Roof did not have the capacity or courage to offer objections and consistently ignored the suggestions he passed along in notes. He said he had advised Mr. Roof to move for a mistrial. Judge Gergel has had none of it. He lectured Mr. Bruck that he had twice held competency hearings and determined that Mr. Roof met the legal thresholds to stand trial and represent himself, a constitutional right. “I have not noticed the bashfulness to make an objection any time he feels it appropriate,” the judge told Mr. Bruck on Friday. He asked Mr. Roof if he felt uncomfortable doing so. “No,” Mr. Roof replied, saying no more. The judge has, however, cautioned Julius N. Richardson, an assistant United States attorney, to restrict the number of victim impact witnesses and the length of their testimony. “At some point it’s too much,” Judge Gergel said. “I’m worried about the cumulative effect. ” Yet, he also acknowledged the emotion of the memories offered from the stand. “There is no antiseptic way to do this,” he said. Although they gradually acceded to Judge Gergel’s suggestion to “streamline” their case, prosecutors have argued that the scale of the massacre justified a large number of witnesses. “He is the one who chose to kill nine people,” Mr. Richardson said of Mr. Roof, who, according to testimony, wore shoes to a closed hearing last week bearing a   symbol of white supremacy. “He is the one who chose to go into a church to do it, and he’s the one who chose to do it to particularly good people. ” Impact statements at capital trials  —   and the legal questions surrounding them  —   rose to prominence in the 1980s as victims’ rights advocates won public support, including the passage of a law that altered the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. But in 1987, the United States Supreme Court ruled that such evidence in capital cases was a “constitutionally unacceptable risk. ” Four years later, it reversed that position when it ruled in Payne v. Tennessee. “Victim impact evidence is simply another form or method of informing the sentencing authority about the specific harm caused by the crime in question,” Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote for the    majority. Such evidence has become a staple of capital proceedings. Before Timothy McVeigh was sentenced to death for the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, which killed 168 people, prosecutors called 38 victim impact witnesses, Mr. Roof noted in a motion. More than a dozen testified at the 2015 trial of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who received the death penalty for the Boston Marathon attack that left three people dead and more than 250 wounded. Researchers have repeatedly found that such evidence has substantial effects on jurors who are weighing capital punishment. Mr. Roof’s choice to not call witnesses means that jurors will “not hear that evidence which tends to dampen the emotional effect” of grieving relatives, said Scott E. Sundby, a law professor at the University of Miami who has studied juror behavior in capital cases. Victim impact witnesses cannot, by law, opine about the penalty they prefer. But the jurors in Charleston have heard stories of intense suffering and loss, one after another. Prosecutors began by eliciting heartfelt reminiscences of family gatherings and final conversations, then pivoted to the excruciating moments of discovery after the killings of June 17, 2015. “I dropped the phone and just started jumping and fell on the floor and stayed there for two hours,” recalled Bethane Middleton Brown, Ms. Doctor’s sister. “I couldn’t move. ” Jurors saw an affecting video of Chris Singleton, the son of Ms.   rapping a tribute to his charismatic mother: “Took your life in the middle of the church, and I just pray, Mama, that you weren’t hurt. ” They heard Malcolm R. Graham, a former North Carolina state senator, describe the deep void left by the death of his sister, Cynthia Hurd, a longtime county librarian who served as his mentor and political guide. “I’m alive, I’m fit, but something is missing,” he said. “I can’t go to the store and replace it. I can’t reinvent it. ” Walter Jackson Jr. seemed to find cruel irony in his grandmother Susie Jackson’s being taken in a hate crime. “She was 87 when she passed, and that’s someone who’s gone through racism, discrimination, segregation,” he said. “Yet she was still that kind of person who still had that unconditional love for everyone. ” Daniel L. Simmons Jr. told of his initial bewilderment that his father, the Rev. Daniel Simmons Sr. a    Vietnam veteran with a license to carry a concealed weapon, had not done more to protect the churchgoers as he always had his family. He got his answer after receiving the keys to his father’s car from the coroner and finding the gun inside. “When I opened the car, it was sitting on the front seat,” Mr. Simmons said. “He took it off before he went to church. ” Death penalty critics complain that the testimony here has traded on the inherent nobility of the victims to advance what they consider the most ignoble of punishments, one that many members of the families say they oppose. They note the paradox that a death sentence for Mr. Roof may bolster support for maintaining a penalty that has been inflicted disproportionately on  . Some said the impact evidence may produce grounds for an appeal. Henderson Hill, a lawyer who founded the Center for Death Penalty Litigation and who attended the proceedings last week, said the tenor amounted to “a whistle for a life for a life. ” “This is so far past the pale of what is acceptable practice that I find it just unrecognizable as a capital sentencing proceeding,” he said. “I’ve never seen this kind of celebration of life, even in black churches where the traditions are that services go on forever. ”"
Brown on Warren’s heritage: ’She can take a DNA test’,CNN,Betsy Klein,2016-06-27," (CNN) Former Sen. Scott Brown on Monday stepped into the attack dog role for Donald Trump, saying his former Senate opponent Elizabeth Warren should ”take a DNA test” if she wants to prove her Native American heritage.  ”She’s not Native American, she’s not   she has no Native American background, except for what her family told her,” Brown told reporters on a conference call hosted by the Republican National Committee, hours after Hillary Clinton and Warren appeared at an event together. ”The easy answer, as you all know, is that Harvard and Penn can release those records, she can authorize the release of those records, she can take a DNA test, she can release the records herself. There’s never been any effort,” Brown said.  Warren responded on Tuesday telling the hosts of ABC’s ”The View” that the comments were aimed at bullying her ”into shutting up.” ”What this is really about is can they bully me into shutting up?” she said. ”Can they be nasty enough and ugly enough and throw enough in my direction that I will say ’oh’ and just go back into the shadows? And the answer is nope, not happening.” Warren and Clinton appeared at a campaign event together earlier in the day, a large part of which was spent slamming Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee.  RELATED: Elizabeth Warren: Donald Trump would ’crush you into the dirt’ Warren has previously said her mother was ”part Cherokee and part Delaware.” Brown called the Massachusetts Democrat’s claimed Native American heritage ”a reverse form of racism,” showing ”very serious character flaws.”   ”Secretary Clinton is considering making someone the vice president who has very serious character flaws when it comes to honesty and credibility and dealing with her heritage, and what did that do? That took away somebody who truly was a Native American and gave that opportunity to somebody who is not, and that’s just not right. It’s a reverse form of racism, quite frankly.”    The issue has come up before, in the the 2012 Massachusetts Senate race. Brown and supporters frequently brought it up on the campaign trail in discussing Warren’s applications to law school teaching roles at Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania. Brown had said Warren ”checked the box claiming she was Native American” in her applications, but a Washington Post fact check found ”there is no proof that she ever marked a form to tell schools about her heritage, nor is there any public evidence that the universities knew about her lineage before hiring her.” Warren, a   candidate, defeated Brown, who later moved to New Hampshire and ran unsuccessfully for Senate from the Granite State. Brown has since become a prominent surrogate for Trump. On Monday he also critiqued Warren’s willingness to appear alongside Clinton, whom he dubbed ”Queen of Wall Street,” calling her support of the presumptive Democratic nominee ”hypocritical.”  Sources tell CNN Warren is among those under consideration for Clinton’s vice presidential pick. Asked whether he hopes she makes the cut, Brown said Clinton has ”much better choices,” pointing to Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, whom he described as ”more vetted, more logical choices.”  As vice presidential speculation fuels for Brown himself, he would not answer whether he is being vetted by the Trump campaign.  ”He will release those names when he feels it’s appropriate,” Brown said, directing inquiries to the Trump campaign. This story has been updated to reflect that the Scott Brown conference call was hosted by the Republican National Committee. "
"Wimbledon: Djokovic, Federer win openers",CNN,Ravi Ubha,2016-06-27,"Wimbledon  (CNN) On the opening day at Wimbledon    the granddaddy of tennis tournaments    three grand slam winners at very different stages of their career featured at the sport’s most famous stadium. As per tradition, the defending men’s champion was the first to walk onto center court. Novak Djokovic is also the world’s   player, but even that doesn’t do him justice.  At 29, the Serb is in his prime after becoming only the third man to hold all four grand slams at once, a feat he achieved by grinding his way to the French Open title three weeks ago.  READ: Djokovic completes collection, He was followed by Garbine Muguruza, who also triumphed at soggy and unseasonably cold Roland Garros. The Spaniard opened her grand slam account on the red clay, with the expectation of further prestigious titles to come the   ’s way.  Last    but by no means least    was Roger Federer.  While Federer has long led the men with 17 grand slams    a record seven of them coming at the All England Club    the outlook for the Swiss isn’t nearly as promising, which is only to be expected given his advanced years in tennis terms.  He turns 35 in August, hasn’t won a major for four years and lacks match practice, having skipped the French Open in the aftermath of a back injury which hampered an already interrupted campaign.  All three progressed to the second round Monday in spring    not summer    conditions that are expected to persist at Wimbledon for the entire fortnight. Some forecasts suggest topping the 20C (68F) mark will be difficult, and a fair bit of rain is expected.  At least, though, Wimbledon has a roof, unlike the French Open.   Djokovic’s outing against British wildcard James Ward was almost perfect for the twice defending champion: He struck plenty of balls    no bad thing considering his dearth of   tussles once again heading into Wimbledon    and was tested late in the second set, but prevailed in straight sets     ( )  .  When Djokovic stormed to a     advantage, the threat of a triple bagel             loomed.  Ward, however, rallied for   with a combination of power and finesse, even holding three break points at  . Djokovic saved them all and cruised in the tiebreak against the world No. 177, ending the brief sequence of suspense.    Of the trio, Muguruza’s   foe, Camila Giorgi, was always destined to be the trickiest. One of the game’s hardest, flattest hitters, the restrained Italian’s lone title came on grass one year ago.  ”Plan B” doesn’t exist for the   Giorgi but when her    style is functioning, she barely needs one. Giorgi was at her booming best in the second set but couldn’t maintain the momentum and fell       as Italy and Spain simultaneously faced off at football’s European Championships across the Channel in France. Italy prevailed   which might have lightened Giorgi’s mood.   Giorgi was unable to recover from being broken in a   game at   in the decider.  A considerable hurdle was thus overcome by Muguruza, since   grand slam champions in the past five years on the women’s tour have struggled in their next major. Her   opponent, qualifier Jana Cepelova of Slovakia, wouldn’t appear to be as dangerous.  Federer tested  Federer    upset this month at a pair of tournaments in Germany    contested his first grand slam match since exiting to Djokovic in the Australian Open semifinals. The rust was evident against Argentina’s Guido Pella, who had never won a   grass court match.  Yet Federer advanced   ( )   ( )   over the   lefty to record a 303rd grand slam win, three behind Martina Navratilova for the   record. Pella will rue not capitalizing when he led   on Federer’s serve at   in the second.  While the grandeur may have lacked, there was no shortage of drama on Wimbledon’s other grass courts.   American 28th seed Sam Querrey, in Djokovic’s quarter of the draw, outlasted Wimbledon giant killer Lukas Rosol   ( )   ( )       Lucie Safarova saved three match points to defeat her close friend and doubles partner Bethanie     ( )   ( )   and Uzbekistan’s Denis Istomin emulated Querrey by coming from two sets down to edge South African 20th seed Kevin Anderson    who stretched Djokovic to five sets 12 months ago at Wimbledon        ( )     ( )  .  British qualifier Marcus Willis, the world No. 772, upset former junior No. 1 Ricardas Berankis      . Willis had to enter   due to his lowly ranking before playing in a second eliminator event.  He is the   qualifier to win a round at a grand slam since a   Jared Palmer at the 1988 U. S. Open.  Earlier this year the    planned to retire and coach full time but his new girlfriend told him not to quit. A good, and lucrative, move. He is guaranteed to pocket about $66, 000    almost equaling his career prize money of $95, 000 prior to Wimbledon    even if he loses in the round of 64.  His opponent? Federer.

Timeline: Recent deadly attacks in Turkey,CNN,Greg Botelho,2016-03-31," (CNN) Three assailants killed dozens of people and injured scores of others in a gun and suicide bombing attack at Istanbul’s Ataturk Airport on Tuesday, Turkish officials said. The attackers arrived in a taxi carrying guns, then opened fire before detonating themselves, Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said on national television early Wednesday.  This is the most recent violence in Turkey, which has been plagued by unrest in 2016. Other recent attacks include: June 8: Car bomb in Midyat, Three people were killed by a car bomb in the southeastern Turkish town of Midyat    the second such attack on Turkish police targets in two days. June 7: 11 killed in Istanbul, A car bomb attack targeting a police bus killed 11 people in Istanbul, Turkey’s    Anadolu agency reported, citing police officials. The blast, in the Beyazit neighborhood of Istanbul’s historic Fatih district, occurred during morning rush hour. It killed seven police officers and four civilians and left 36 people injured, three of them critically, authorities said. Four people were detained. March 31:  7 police officers slain, Seven police officers died and at least 27 more people were wounded by a car bombing close to a bus terminal in southeastern Turkey. The bomb went off as a police vehicle was going past in the Baglar district of Diyarbakir, the capital of its namesake province, about 170 kilometers (100 miles) from the Syrian border, according to Turkey’s semiofficial Anadolu news agency.  The injured include 14 civilians and 13 police. It was not immediately clear who was responsible for the attack.  March 19: Istanbul blast kills 4 foreigners, A suicide bomber detonated explosives in a busy tourist area of central Istanbul, killing at least four people and wounding 36 others. Two of the four dead were   dual citizens, an Israeli government source and a U. S. source said. A third Israeli also died, along with an Iranian. Interior Minister Efkan Ala identified that attacker as Mehmet Ozturk and claimed he had links to ISIS. March 13: Kurdish rebels claim Ankara blast,   people died in when a car bomb ripped through a busy square in Turkey’s capital, Ankara. The Kurdistan Freedom Falcons, or TAK    a militant offshoot of the Kurdish separatist group PKK, which seeks an independent state in Turkey    boasted that its members carried out this attack. A ceasefire between Turkey and the PKK, or Kurdistan Worker’s Party, fell apart last summer. Since then, Turkish forces have bombed the terror group’s positions in northern Iraq and imposed curfews in crackdowns on heavily Kurdish areas in southeastern Turkey.   February 17: Explosion hits military vehicles  An explosion apparently targeting military vehicles in Ankara left 29 dead and 61 wounded, according to Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus. All but one of the fatalities were members of the security forces. Three military vehicles and one private vehicle were stopped at a traffic light when the bomb went off, sending large flames shooting into the night sky. Later that week, the Kurdistan Freedom Falcons called that attack a ”suicide revenge mission” for Turkish military operations in the southeastern Turkish district of Cizre and threatened more violence. January 12: Strike near tourist attractions, A suicide blast in Istanbul’s Sultanahmet Square killed 13 people, eight of them Germans, in what was viewed as a strike against both Turkish culture and the country’s   tourism industry. The explosion ripped through a typically busy area between between the Hagia Sophia and Blue Mosque, both major tourist attractions in Istanbul. Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu blamed ISIS, which has entrenched itself in neighboring Syria and Iraq while lashing out elsewhere again and again."
"Istanbul airport attack: 36 dead, 147 injured, Turkish officials say",CNN,,2016-06-28,"Istanbul, Turkey  (CNN) Gunshots, screams and explosions pierced the air Tuesday as three terrorists armed with bombs and guns killed at least 36 people  at Istanbul Ataturk Airport in Turkey.  Witnesses described deadly carnage and crowds in a panic as the attackers struck one of the world’s busiest airports. At least 36 people were killed, Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said. An additional 147 people were wounded, Turkey’s Justice Minister Bekir Bozdag said. There was no immediate claim of responsibility. Sue Savage was in the airport to see a friend off when she heard gunshots and then an explosion. More gunshots rang out, followed by another boom, she told ”Erin Burnett OutFront.” Coverage from CNN Turk, She ducked into a men’s prayer room and then into a men’s toilet, where she hid in a stall with a young woman.  They came out about  30 minutes later, and heard more screams and gunshots. They ducked into a room where luggage is inspected.  She and about 30 people were herded into a women’s prayer room until authorities led them out and down an escalator into the main terminal hall. ”There was a lot of blood,” she said. The floor was marked with bloody boot marks as the group was led to the other side of the room. ”There was so much glass on the floor they were scuffing it aside so we didn’t slip,” she said. Video from inside the terminal shows people fleeing and the bright orange flash of fire from one of the explosions. Victims stagger and some fall from the    slick floor. Another video shows a man walking with a gun, which he drops when he’s apparently shot by a security officer. The man slumps to the ground and the officer briefly stands over him before running. About 10 seconds later, there is an explosion.  Traveler Laurence Cameron described what he saw after he stepped off a plane. ”It was just a massive crowd of screaming people. Some were falling over themselves. A poor chap in a wheelchair was just left, and everyone just rushed to the back of the building, and then people ran the other way and no one really seemed to know what was going on,” he told CNN. ”Where you normally hail a taxi, that is where the attack happened. The ground is just kind of shredded. There are bloodstains on the floor as well.” Two bombs in international terminal, official says, Of the three bombers in the airport attack, two were at the international terminal, and the third terrorist was in the nearby parking lot, a Turkish official told CNN. All three detonated suicide vests. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan called for a unified international fight against terrorism. ”Make no mistake: For terrorist organizations, there is no difference between Istanbul and London, Ankara and Berlin, Izmir and Chicago or Antalya and Rome,” he said. ”Unless all governments and the entire mankind join forces in the fight against terrorism, much worse things than what we fear to imagine today will come true.” The attacks happened on a warm summer night at the airport, east of Istanbul, which is the 11th busiest in the world in terms of passenger traffic.  The airport was closed overnight for several hours, and flights into the airport had been diverted to the capital of Ankara and other cities. The airport has since reopened, and the U. S. Federal Aviation Administration said it has lifted a ground stop for flights between the United States and the airport. Prime Minister Yildirim told reporters that the airport was opened for incoming and outgoing flights early Wednesday, according to the semiofficial Anadolu news agency. Turkish PM: Attack likely from ISIS, ”The terrorists came to the airport in a taxi and then carried out their attacks,” the Prime Minister said. ”The fact that they were carrying guns added to the toll. Preliminary findings suggest all three attackers first opened fire then detonated themselves.”  Yildirim didn’t clarify why, but said signs pointed to ISIS being behind the attacks. The attacks occurred with a little more than a week left in the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Multiple U. S. officials told CNN’s Pamela Brown and Elise Labott that the early thinking among U. S. intelligence officials was that ISIS or an   group was to blame. Like the Turkish Prime Minister, the officials said there is much more investigating to be done. One official said the attack bears the hallmarks of ISIS because of the target and the method. And a senior US official pointed to the way it was coordinated using weapons and explosions. Some analysts say that this type of attack is a response to ISIS recent defeats in Iraq and Syria, notably the loss of Falluja. ”They may lose ground, but they’re still a potent force,” CNN analyst Bob Baer said. ”They know their days in Iraq and Syria are probably numbered, they’ve got to find somewhere else to operate,” said retired Lt. Col. Rick Francona, a former U. S. military attaché in Syria. It would be a ”big surprise” if it was the PKK    or Kurdistan Workers’ Party     based on how the attack was conducted.  The PKK tends to target military and security installations, other officials said. Terror attacks in Turkey, Turkey has been rocked by a string of terror attacks over the past year as it weathers bombing campaigns by ISIS and Kurdish militants. As part of the U. S.  coalition against ISIS, Turkey allows coalition planes to fly raids on ISIS targets in neighboring Iraq and Syria from its territory. And last year, Turkey resumed hostilities with the PKK, Kurdish militant separatists, after a   cease fire broke down. The PKK has been in an armed struggle with the Turkish government for decades and is considered a terror group by Turkey, the United States and the European Union. Understanding Turkey’s deadly catalog of enemies, In March, at least 37 were killed when a car bomb detonated near a bus stop in the Turkish capital, Ankara, in an attack claimed by a Kurdish militant group. Six days later, an ISIS suicide bomber detonated himself on one of Istanbul’s main streets, killing four.    A month earlier, 28 were killed in a blast targeting military vehicles in central Ankara. A Kurdish group claimed responsibility. And in January, at least 10 German tourists died in a suicide bombing in Istanbul’s Sultanahmet Square that Turkish authorities linked to ISIS. The violence has had an impact on Turkey’s tourism industry, a key sector of the national economy. U. S. expresses condolences, support, Ataturk Airport is ”one of the most secure airports in the world,” CNN senior law enforcement analyst Tom Fuentes said. But the airport has been ”very overwhelmed for several decades with terrorism from PKK.” Experts say Turkey is especially vulnerable because of the terror groups operating there.  ”You cannot protect these airports 100% . .. especially in a place like Turkey, where ISIS has cells everywhere,” said  Francona, the  former U. S. military attaché in Syria. The White House issued a statement condemning the terror act.  ”Ataturk International Airport, like Brussels Airport which was attacked earlier this year, is a symbol of international connections and the ties that bind us together,” it said.  ”Our deepest condolences go out to the families and loved ones of those killed, and we wish a speedy recovery to those injured. We remain steadfast in our support for Turkey, our NATO ally and partner, along with all of our friends and allies around the world, as we continue to confront the threat of terrorism.” The U. S. Embassy in Ankara sent consular officers to the airport to see whether any of the victims were from the United States.  There were no immediate indications of any American casualties, a senior State Department official said. "
Trump: Special interests pushing trade deal want to ’rape our country’,CNN,Jeremy Diamond,2016-06-29,"St. Clairsville, Ohio (CNN) Donald Trump on Tuesday once again used the word ”rape” to describe the economic turmoil he believes bad trade deals are inflicting on the U. S. ”The   Partnership is another disaster done and pushed by special interests who want to rape our country    just a continuing rape of our country,” Trump told a crowd of supporters in Ohio. Hours earlier, Trump announced in an economic policy speech that as president he would pull the U. S. out of the TPP, a massive free trade agreement between the U. S. and 11 other countries. He did not describe the deal as ”rape” in his prepared remarks, which he read off teleprompters in a more subdued tone. Teleprompters cast aside as he emerged before a crowd of several thousand supporters in Ohio, Trump used the word rape three times to describe the TPP, despite conceding that it is ”a harsh word.” ”That’s what it is, too. It’s a harsh word. It’s a rape of our country,” the billionaire real estate mogul said. ”This is done by wealthy people that want to take advantage of us and that want to sign another partnership.” Trump previously used the word early last month while stumping in Indiana just days before the state handed him a decisive victory that helped him clinch the Republican nomination. ”We can’t continue to allow China to rape our country, and that’s what they’re doing,” Trump said as he lamented the trade imbalance between the U. S. and China.  Trump’s repeated use of the word ”rape” to describe economic turmoil    and not sexual assault    comes as the billionaire has hinted at softening his rhetoric and positions on some of his most controversial proposals. Trump has begun to focus on banning individuals from still undefined terror states, instead of banning all foreign Muslims as he proposed in December. And the billionaire rejected characterizing his call to deport all estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the U. S. as a ”mass deportation.”  But asked Saturday during a gaggle with reporters whether he had been following the Stanford rape case    which has reignited a national conversation around sexual assault on college campuses and criminal justice    Trump said he had not been."
Police in UK arrest 3 after racist outburst on tram,CNN,,2016-06-29," (CNN) Police in Manchester, England, arrested two young men and a teenager in connection with an apparent hate incident on a tram Tuesday.  Video of the incident, which shows several men taunting a male commuter who appears to be of mixed race, quickly drew outrage after being posted online.  The incident occurred about 7. 40 a. m. local time. The video shows the victim in a heated exchange with the suspects, who call him an ”immigrant” and tell him to ”get back to Africa.” Several of the suspects appear to be holding bottles of beer, and at one point a suspect tries to flick some of it on the victim. The subject of the abuse asks one of the suspects if he is a teenager before saying he had lived in the United Kingdom longer than the assailant. Other commuters on the train appear to come to the victim’s defense. Greater Manchester Police said three males    ages 20, 18 and 16    were arrested on suspicion of affray and were being held for questioning. Their names were not made public. Although the suspects in the video do not allude to Brexit, the incident occurred amid a rise in hate crimes following Britain’s decision to leave the European Union.  There was a 57% increase in reporting of hate crimes in the UK during this weekend following the Brexit vote, according to True Vision, the   website designed to provide the public with information about hate crimes. ”All hate incidents are treated with the upmost severity and this behaviour will not be tolerated in Greater Manchester,” said GMP Chief Inspector Gareth Parkin. Andy Burnham, a member of Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour shadow cabinet, said that ”people in Greater Manchester who voted Leave did not vote for this.”  Burnham is bidding to become Labour’s Manchester mayoral candidate in 2017.  Manchester’s police commissioner, Tony Lloyd, said that people in the city have worked hard to build ”strong, cohesive, and welcoming communities,” and that there is no room there for hatred and division.  Amnesty International announced a new campaign on Tuesday to combat the reported rise in racial abuse following the   Brexit referendum.  ”Some people now feel licensed to express racist views in a way we haven’t seen for decades,” said Kate Allen, Amnesty’s UK director. ”The referendum campaign was marked by divisive, xenophobic rhetoric as well as a failure from political leaders to condemn it. We are now reaping the referendum rhetoric whirlwind,” she said. ”We’re simply not prepared to stand by and let hate become the norm in Britain.”"
Word of Life trial: victim admits ’inappropriately’ touching children ,CNN,,2016-06-29," (CNN) Christopher Leonard survived the beating in the sanctuary of the Word of Life Christian Church in upstate New York that killed his brother, Lucas Leonard. On Tuesday, while testifying against his   Sarah Ferguson, one of eight church members charged in connection with the death, Christopher Leonard admitted he had ”inappropriately” touched her children. His   learned about the touching during a church ”counseling session” in October 2015, he testified. ”And you were telling [Ferguson] about that, correct?” defense attorney Rebecca Wittman asked. ”Yes,” Christopher Leonard responded.  ”And you were sort of using graphic details about what you had done, correct?” Wittman asked.  ”Yes,” Leonard said. The fatal beating of Lucas Leonard, 19, came after he had  ”expressed a desire to leave” the church about 250 miles north of New York City, New Hartford Police Chief Michael Inserra said in October.  That apparently prompted a counseling session on the spiritual state of Lucas and his younger brother, Christopher, now 18, Inserra said. Christopher Leonard testified Ferguson ”hit [him] the most” with a cord and that he was hit in the back, chest, legs and genital area.  Lucas Leonard was taken to the hospital after church members found he wasn’t breathing, police said. He suffered injuries so severe that emergency room doctors thought he had been shot, Inserra said. An autopsy showed Lucas Leonard suffered multiple contusions from   trauma to the torso and extremities, authorities said. A combination of the injuries plus the duration of assault contributed to his death. The beatings included blows to the teenagers’ genital areas. At the hospital, Bruce Leonard, the brothers’ father, accused Lucas Leonard of molesting children as a possible justification for his injuries    an allegation Inserra says was unfounded. ”The investigation did not disclose any indications of Lucas or Christopher sexually abusing any child,” Inserra said in a Tuesday email to CNN.  ”To the contrary, the investigators were told it would have been impossible for either of these boys to commit any inappropriate acts.  Other than Chris stating he had ’bad thoughts’ there is nothing to indicate he committed any crime.  In [New York] we cannot convict anyone on an admission alone. . ..” Interviews and physical exams of the children showed no signs of sexual abuse, he said. ”The admission by Chris” came out only in the last week or so, Inserra said. Eight members of the Word of Life Church, including the teens’ father and the church pastor were indicted by a grand jury in November. Seven were charged with   murder. All eight were charged with manslaughter, kidnapping and assault in relation to Lucas Leonard’s death and faced kidnapping and assault charges in connection to the injuries to Christopher Leonard. All defendants have entered not guilty pleas, according to an official in the clerk’s office at the Oneida County Court.   Prosecutors and police did not immediately return requests for comment about the alleged ”inappropriate” touching by Leonard.  Ferguson’s children are now in the custody of local child welfare authorities.  The church, which began in 1984, has about five families, or about 35 members, including children, a former Word of Life church member said last year. The woman, who asked not to be identified, described the congregation as a ”makeshift family” that had been together for 25 years."
House hunting by helicopter takes off among Chinese,CNN,,2016-06-29,"Hong Kong (CNN) Out of the helicopter window, a deafening 1, 500 feet below, lies the wealthiest neighborhood on earth. Nineteen residents of Deep Water Bay    located on the prestigious southside of Hong Kong Island    have a total net worth of $123 billion. And more big spenders are set to arrive, with the construction of another luxury development at Deep Water Bay Drive underway. We’re in a helicopter because that’s how property developer Nan Fung anticipates the ultra, ultra high net worth individuals who buy this real estate    many of whom are expected to be mainland Chinese    will first see the property. From the vantage point of the gods. Chop chop, House hunting by helicopter is an exhilarating new aerial industry catering to clients with dizzying budgets, which has emerged on a noticeable scale over the past two years, according to global property firm Quintessentially Estates. Its advantages are manifold: clients can asses vasts swathes of land in a matter of hours, and glean information about a property that is not apparent when on foot. ”The Deep Water Bay site is totally different when you look at it on the ground,” says Donald Choi, managing director of Nan Fung. ”From up here, you can see the rolling hills, the topography, how the mountains are behind it and sea is in front, which is excellent feng shui.”  Liu Chan, 51, a real estate investor from Qingdao, recently used the services of a ”helirealtor” to buy a condo at the Auberge Beach Residences in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. ”After the safety briefing, I expected the ride to be bumpy, like in a small aircraft, but it was actually very smooth and the views were amazing,” he tells CNN. ”It was a complimentary service . .. and something I’d never thought of before.”  The Chinese are rising, This trend is largely a response to the growing offshore spending power of Chinese buyers, says Iain Brand, of Quintessentially Estates. The firm has facilitated aerial property searches for mainland Chinese clients in France and Thailand. ”The Chinese are on a buying splurge of wine estates in Bordeaux, because they love the local wine, and French chateaus are popular, too,” Brand tells CNN. ”We did a big search last summer for a mainland Chinese buyer in France. The client had a budget of 30 million euros ($33. 4 million) for a wine estate of 30, 000 hectares. ”He wanted a specific    helicopter. It’s a lot safer    if one engine fails, you also have another    and there’s bigger cabin space.” Quintessentially arranged the logistics, while the client paid for the helicopter, and spent four days covering thousands of acres of land, flitting between working vineyards    assessing their layout, proximity to local airports and amenities, and privacy. That wouldn’t have been possible by car in the same timeframe, says Brand.  Extra luxuries, such as champagne in the chopper and lunch stops at remote beauty sites, can be worked into the package. Spending power, At roughly $2, 000 an hour, by Quintessentially Estates’ estimates, hiring a ”helirealtor” may sound extravagant, but    as with so many things    it’s all relative. In 2015, total Chinese outbound capital on foreign property reached nearly $30 billion, according to the Knight Frank Chinese Outbound Real Estate Investment report. As the number of   net worth individuals (those with a net worth of over $30 million) has risen in China over the past 10 years, so has their appetite for offshore property, both to secure foreign education opportunities for their children and for investment opportunities. Last year, owner of teach giant Alibaba, Jack Ma, spent HK$1. 5 billion ($193 million)    or HK$151, 000 per square foot    buying a property on the Peak in Hong Kong. Such spending power puts the price of a helicopter hunt into perspective. ”When you’re that wealthy, it’s cheaper to save time than to be out of the office for days doing endless viewings by car,” Brand says. Rise of the helirealator, As the demand for an efficient yet luxury   hunt grows, some realtors are gaining helicopter licenses, and vice versa. Marc Hennes is a commercial helicopter    operating along the Miami coast, also catering to a growing group of Chinese buyers. He explains there are unique advantages to helicopter viewings. ”If you’re buying a penthouse in a new construction that hasn’t been built yet, it’s hard to imagine the view from that level,” says Hennes, who flies a Robinson R44 with a ”safety” pilot, who takes over when he talks clients through the opportunities below. ”I can fly clients to the penthouse level, to visualize that view. They get a kick out of that.”  But perhaps most important of all, admits Hennes, is the swagger factor. ”I show them the beaches, the   areas and how far amenities are from certain locations. ”But it’s all about the bragging rights. They take pictures and videos, and show them to their friends. And from that I get referrals.”"
Trump on waterboarding: ’Fight fire with fire’,CNN,Theodore Schleifer,2016-06-28,"Washington (CNN) Donald Trump responded to Tuesday’s terror attack at a Turkish airport by calling for the U. S. to ”fight fire with fire” when it comes to battling ISIS, including the use of waterboarding.  ”You know, you have to fight fire with fire,” Trump told an Ohio rally as he described ISIS’s brutal tactics, including decapitating and burning prisoners to death. Trump reiterated that U. S. leadership is ”weak” and ”stupid” and that he is in favor of using waterboarding and ”worse” torture methods on terror suspects. Trump described waterboarding as ”not the nicest thing, but it’s peanuts compared to many alternatives,” standing by previous comments he’s made on the practice, which have drawn sharp criticism throughout his presidential campaign not just from the left, but also from some fellow Republicans.  At least 36 people died and 147 others wounded in a terror attack at Istanbul Ataturk Airport, according to Turkey’s Justice Minister Bekir Bozdag. There has been no immediate claim of responsibility. In March, Trump called for broadening laws to allow for the use of torture, including but not limited to waterboarding. His stance has put him at odds with some members of his own party including Sen. John McCain.  Trump, whose foreign policy pitch to voters has included calls for a stronger response to ISIS, also spotlighted that toughness on Tuesday.  ”Folks, there’s something going on that’s really, really bad. All right? It’s bad. And we better get smart and we better get tough,” he said. ”Or we’re not going to have much of a country left, OK?” He deemed American enemies in a statement to be ”brutal and ruthless and will do anything to murder those who do not bend to their will.” Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton instead responded by calling for international cooperation. Clinton said the attack meant the U. S. ”cannot retreat.”  ”We must deepen our cooperation with our allies and partners in the Middle East and Europe to take on this threat,” she said in a statement. ”Such cooperation is essential to protecting the homeland and keeping our country safe.”"
No need for Brexit panic,CNN,,2016-06-28," (CNN) Sterling has plummeted. London’s stock market is in free fall, and investment is on hold. Prime Minister David Cameron has announced his intention to resign, and the main opposition Labour Party is in turmoil. To listen to some of the more hysterical commentary, Britain has been plunged into perpetual crisis with its decision last week to leave the European Union. It won’t be long before the British are appealing for food parcels, and the Red Cross is raising emergency funds across the world to rescue the beleaguered island.  Ignore it. In fact, Britain is a big enough country to do just fine outside the EU. Its economy will bounce back very quickly, and it will see little loss of international stature. Brexit may well be a mistake, but, rather like heading out of the house on a cloudy day without your umbrella, it will be one more of carelessness than anything else. Within five years we will have forgotten what all the fuss was about. In the markets, Brexit is being treated as a cross between the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the start of World War III. In truth, that says more about the hysteria of investors than anything else. Britain accounts for about 3. 5% of global output. Its exports to the rest of Europe account for about 14% of its GDP. So even in the   scenario, in which British goods are completely banned from Europe, we are still only talking about less than 0. 5% of global output. That is a rounding error. What possible difference it can make to Samsung or Apple it is hard to say. Actually, though, Britain’s economy is fundamentally strong, and will bounce back quickly. The devaluation of the pound will strengthen its exports, and make sure its companies can easily overcome any tariffs that might be imposed in Europe. If demand dips, the Bank of England can still cut interest rates or launch another blast of quantitative easing. The United Kingdom’s real strengths these days are incredibly flexible labor markets, one of the highest rates of entrepreneurship in the developed world, and the lowest corporate tax rate of any major economy, all of which have made it a magnet for inward investment. Trade with Europe has been declining relentlessly for a decade    down from 55% of exports in 1999 to 44% in 2014    and Brexit will only accelerate a trend that had been underway for years. As economic shocks go, leaving the EU will turn out to have been a minor one.  Britain’s standing in the world won’t suffer much damage either. In fact, it will probably rely on membership in the European Economic Area, alongside Norway, Iceland and Lichtenstein, and, under British leadership that will turn into a far more significant bloc. Don’t be surprised if the Danes, the Poles and the Czechs opt to join a more nimble EEA led by the UK rather than a   EU    which would mean that paradoxically Britain has more clout outside the EU than it ever did within it.  In reality, Britain’s standing in the world had relatively little to do with its role in the EU anyway. Maybe the U. S. secretary of state will be slightly less keen on talking to the British foreign secretary, and slightly more keen on holding discussions with the German one. But does any normal person lose sleep worrying about stuff like that? The crucial point is that the English language and British pop and serious culture do far more to enhance Britain’s global influence than anything that happens in Brussels.  At the same time, the Internet does far more to promote connectedness between people of different countries and culture than any EU initiative offered the choice between Google and the European Union, nobody would choose the latter. Political institutions are less important with every year that passes, and the more remote they are    and none are more remote than the EU    the more that is true.  In five years’ time, we will look back at the Brexit scare and wonder what all the fuss was about. The UK will remain together, and its economy will have much the same mix of strengths and weaknesses it has always had. The eurozone will be stumbling from crisis to crisis, and the EU will remain paralyzed by indecision, stuck with painfully slow growth and declining influence.  Ultimately, the real lesson of Brexit may well be to teach us that the EU doesn’t make much difference to anything anymore. A country can leave, and hardly even notice. And that may be what is really worrying for its   future.  Join us on Facebook. . Read CNNOpinion’s new Flipboard magazine."
"Obama, Trump throw down on trade",CNN,Eric Bradner,2016-06-28," (CNN) President Barack Obama laid into Donald Trump’s protectionist trade stance Wednesday, blasting the presumptive Republican nominee’s call for a withdrawal from trade deals as the ”wrong medicine.”  Obama’s comments, which came during a trip to Canada to meet with his fellow North American heads of state, came as Trump fights a public war with the business lobby over the issue.  ”Ordinary people who have concerns about trade have a legitimate gripe about globalization,” Obama continued, pointing to ”growing inequality and stagnant wages.”  ”The question is, what do you do about it. And the prescription of withdrawing from trade deals and focusing solely on your local market    that’s the wrong medicine,” he said. Road to 270: The 2016 Electoral Map, Obama called the idea ”not feasible” because local businesses would suffer and lose jobs if they didn’t have access to international markets and because the costs of local goods would rise. Trump, speaking at a rally in Bangor, Maine, focused his fire on the U. S. Chamber of Commerce, saying they are ”totally controlled by the special interest groups . .. they want to have the deals they want to have.” Trump also took on the Chamber earlier in the day, tweeting, ”The @USCHAMBER must fight harder for the American worker. China, and many others, are taking advantage of U. S. with our terrible trade pacts.” Trump plans to press ahead with his   trade message in a speech in New Hampshire set for Thursday afternoon. Powerful business lobbies    both traditionally supportive of Republican candidates    took the highly unusual step of lashing out at Trump during a speech he gave Tuesday that hammered U. S.   deals. ”Under Trump’s trade plans, we would see higher prices, fewer jobs, and a weaker economy,” the Chamber tweeted during Tuesday’s speech in Monessen, Pennsylvania, linking to an analysis that argues Trump’s trade positions would throw the United States into an economic recession.  And the Chamber kept up its attacks on Trump Wednesday. ”The U. S. Chamber represents American businesses of all sizes from across the country, who recognize that free trade agreements, like the (  Partnership) are an important way to accelerate economic growth and spur job creation in the U. S.,” Blair Latoff Holmes, a spokesman for the Chamber, said in a statement. ”This is not personal. It’s not election politics. It’s smart policy.” A break between traditional allies, The onslaught reflected a major break between   business interests and the party’s 2016 presidential nominee and demonstrate the possible downside to Trump of running as a protectionist Republican. It also comes as Trump attempts to ramp up fundraising    a challenge that could prove more difficult if the party’s business backers decide to back Hillary Clinton or focus their money on assisting   Republicans.  The truth about trade, American jobs and Donald Trump, Clinton’s campaign released a statement as well, saying Trump’s speech rejected ”the idea that Americans can compete and win in the global economy,” and went    disputing Trump’s arguments or made the case with past Clinton statements that she had better ideas.  ”Throughout this campaign, Trump’s statements on trade, like everything else he says, have been erratic and irresponsible, full of bluster and the promise of a reckless trade strategy that would put American jobs at risk,” Clinton’s statement said.  Trump has broken from Republican orthodoxy and embraced a protectionist trade stance that more closely mirrors liberals such as Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.  The real estate mogul has opposed the   Partnership, and on Tuesday said he’d seek to withdraw the United States from the North American Free Trade Agreement    a move that would result in the upheaval of economies across the continent.  Trump argued that by doing so, he’d create more manufacturing jobs in the United States    a key element of his appeal to white,   communities in swing states such as Ohio, Pennsylvania and Michigan.  ”Why would the USChamber be upset by the fact that I want to negotiate better and stronger trade deals or that I want penalties for cheaters?” Trump also tweeted Wednesday. The Chamber rebutted Trump    arguing that NAFTA has created 5 million jobs, that the United States is selling more to South Korea since signing a trade deal and that the   Partnership would add $77 billion to the U. S. economy by 2025.  ”Even under best case scenario, Trump’s tariffs would strip us of at least 3. 5 million jobs,” the Chamber tweeted.  Jay Timmons, the president of the National Association of Manufacturers, also took aim at Trump in a series of critical tweets.  Directing his comments at Trump, he said that ”you have it backward” and that ”to win, WE need to write rules on trade    not China.” He also tweeted: ”. @realDonaldTrump should understand 40% of manufacturing jobs are related to exports. We need more    not less.” The Business Roundtable, another leading U. S. business organization representing the CEOs of major companies, also weighed in with a Medium post on what candidates are getting wrong on trade    though it’s much less direct than the Chamber and National Association of Manufacturers attacks.  Asked if the criticism of Trump is an unprecedented step into a presidential race by the traditionally   Chamber, Holmes said in an email Tuesday that ”this is about policy, not politics.”  ”The Chamber has long supported advancing and expanding trade, including TPP,” she wrote. ”Despite much of the rhetoric we have heard out on the campaign trail, the next president should understand that selling more   goods and services around the world is one of the best ways to spur economic growth, support small businesses, create   American jobs, and keep the United States one step ahead of its international competitors. ”After all, 95% of the world’s consumers now live outside America’s borders, representing nearly limitless expansion opportunities for U. S. businesses and entrepreneurs.” Holmes did pour cold water on the possibility that the Chamber could endorse Clinton in the presidential race despite its opposition to Trump’s trade positions.  The Chamber has in the past hit Clinton and Sanders for failing to offer broad enough support for free trade. Clinton has said she, too, opposes the   Partnership    a deal negotiated under President Barack Obama, and which Clinton had once called the ”gold standard” of trade pacts during her tenure as secretary of state.  But free trade critics point out her husband, Bill Clinton, was responsible for implementing NAFTA    the first   trade deal.  ”For 104 years, the US Chamber has never gotten involved in a presidential race, and we do not plan to,” Holmes said.  Holmes quickly followed up to signal that the Chamber’s criticism of Trump’s trade positions won’t soon be ending.  ”I want to add that while we don’t engage in presidential politics, we’ve also never hesitated to engage in a policy discussion,” she said.

Trump will say anything to get elected,CNN,,2016-06-28," (CNN) Get out your Etch A Sketch    Donald Trump might be about to redraw another one of his positions.  According to CNN, Trump is expected to soften his position on Muslim immigration to the United States in a new policy memo to be rolled out soon. In it, the campaign is expected to shift away from a temporary ban on Muslim immigrants to a ban on people coming from countries with known terrorism links.  While this new position from Trump might seem less offensive than his earlier call for a ban on all Muslim immigration, this policy is still problematic. Not only is it impractical, but it could potentially make fighting terrorism more difficult.  Moreover, it gives further credence to the troubling notion that Trump will say or do anything to get elected.  It was only six months ago that Trump called for a ”a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country’s representatives can figure out what is going on.” But this weekend, he told CNN’s Jeremy Diamond that he only wants to focus on the people coming from ”the terror states.” The problem here is defining what constitutes a ”terror state.” The Wall Street Journal reports that there have been attacks attempted or carried out against the United States and Europe by people from the United Kingdom, Belgium, France, Egypt, Nigeria and Syria, among other countries. Does that make all those countries potential ”terror states?” China could be linked to terrorism over the alleged transfer of sensitive technology to Iran.  Would Trump ban immigration from China? Ascertaining which nations are ”terror states” becomes even more difficult when we focus on the Middle East. Saudi Arabia has been linked to terrorism, yet the country is one of our strongest and most reliable allies in the region. If a Trump administration were to antagonize the Saudi Kingdom, it would make our intelligence gathering in the region more difficult.  Or consider Syria, which the U. S. State Department has labeled a state sponsor of terrorism. If we were to ban immigration form Syria, we would be slamming the door on refugees and asylum seekers who are desperate to escape the conflict and violence that has racked their nation.  This is as   as it is inhumane.    What Trump doesn’t understand is that the fight against terrorism, as well as the immigration issue, is inherently complex, so any potential solution must be thoughtful and nuanced. If it were as easy to clamp down on terrorism as Trump thinks it is, our government would have done it long ago.   Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks told CNN that Trump no longer supports a blanket ban on Muslims and only wants to ban Muslims from terror states. Yet a limited ban on Muslim immigration is just as offensive as a   ban on Muslim immigration. Under such a policy, a Muslim from Syria might not be able to enter the United States. But a Christian from Syria would be allowed in. This sort of religious test for entry into the U. S. strikes at the core of who we are as a nation and would likely be judged unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.  While Trump’s new position on immigration may signal his pivoting to the center in advance of a general election, this too is an  . Remember, Trump made his opposition to Muslim immigration a key point of his campaign. Then he seemed to   on his   immigration stance as recently as June 12, after the Orlando shootings.  He tweeted then that he was ”right” about terrorism, although that shooter was a U. S. citizen.  That Trump would now back away from one of his signature immigration positions must seem something of a ”bait and switch” to the more than 12 million people who voted for him in the GOP primaries. Then again, Trump has been all over the place on many issues. He has reportedly changed his political affiliation on multiple occasions. He has been both   and  . He once praised the DREAMers (young undocumented immigrants) now he is an immigration hardliner. Taken together, this all suggests a lack of an ideological core and a consistent policy vision.  Trump has even lately adjusted his stance on illegal immigration.  While he plans to get rid of what he calls ”bad dudes,” he says there will be none of his previously threatened ”mass deportations.” It is enough to make a Trump supporter wonder if everything is negotiable with their businessman candidate.  True, it is not really a surprise these days when a politician   on an issue.  Although Hillary Clinton once called the   Partnership ”the gold standard” for trade agreements, for example, she now opposes it. But the trade agreement was never central to Clinton’s campaign the way immigration has been to Trump’s 2016 bid. It’s easy to surmise that Trump’s new immigration position was motivated by his latest,    poll numbers one national poll by the Washington Post gives Clinton a   lead over The Donald.  For all his bluster about taking on Washington and ”telling it like it is,” Trump sure is acting like a typical politician. And his willingness to shift extreme positions on key issues is as brazen as it is  .   Trump is a political grifter. His latest shift is just one more reminder that he is too uninformed, unprepared, and unqualified to serve as president. Join us on Facebook. . Read CNNOpinion’s new Flipboard magazine. "
John Kerry: Iran ’helpful’ in fighting ISIS in Iraq,CNN,Theodore Schleifer,2016-06-28," (CNN) Secretary of State John Kerry on Tuesday deemed Iran’s presence in Iraq to be ”helpful” to American attempts to beat back the threat of ISIS, given their common enemy. The measured praise for a country with which the U. S. has a fraught relationship came at the Aspen Ideas Festival, where the secretary of state was asked to assess whether Iran was ”more helpful or more harmful” there. ”Look, we have challenges with Iran as everybody knows and we are working on those challenges,” Kerry said. ”But I can tell you that Iran in Iraq has been in certain ways helpful, and they clearly are focused on   and so we have a common interest, actually.” Kerry was using a different name for ISIS. The top U. S. diplomat explained that he and his Iranian counterparts could now more easily solve global crises and directly communicate. Brent McGurk, the U. S. special envoy tasked with defeating ISIS, said earlier Tuesday that   Shi’ite militias are mostly helpful in Iraq, though some go rogue. ”We think most of these popular mobilization forces do operate under the control of the Iraqi state, but about  % of them actually do not,” McGurk said. ”And those groups are a fundamental problem.”"
"Kennedy votes signal resolution, not revolution",CNN,,2016-06-28," (CNN) At the close of the current Supreme Court term, Justice Anthony Kennedy cast decisive votes affirming the constitutionality of affirmative action in higher education and striking down a Texas state regulation on abortion facilities.   Kennedy’s actions mark a departure from his previous positions, but his recent votes in Fisher and Whole Women’s Health reflect tensions in his previous opinions between his broad language and specific votes.  They also reveal the reality that, even with late Justice Antonin Scalia’s chair vacant, the Court could not delay decisions in these cases any longer.  Prior to last week, Kennedy had never voted to uphold an affirmative action policy, but he had long indicated at least rhetorical support for race playing some role in admissions.   Although he dissented from the ruling in Grutter v. Bollinger in 2003 that affirmed the University of Michigan Law School’s use of race to admit a critical mass of minority students, Kennedy nonetheless found ”no constitutional objection to the goal of considering race as one modest factor among many others to achieve diversity.”   Four years later in Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1, Kennedy rejected Chief Justice John Roberts’s assertion that ”the way to stop discrimination on the basis on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race,” finding him ”too dismissive of the legitimate interest government has in ensuring all people have equal opportunity regardless of their race.” Even when striking previous affirmative action programs, Kennedy reiterated ”approval of giving appropriate consideration to race in this one context.”   With last week’s decision in Fisher, Kennedy finally found an ”appropriate consideration.”  ”The fact that   played a role in only a small portion of admissions decisions,” Kennedy wrote, ”should be a hallmark of narrow tailoring.” Surveying changes in enrollment, Kennedy concluded the university’s ”consideration of race has had a meaningful, if still limited, effect on the diversity of the freshman class.”  The hybrid admission policy adopted by the University of Texas at Austin may be ”sui generis,” and the Court’s approval ”may limit its value for prospective guidance.”  But it is the one use of race Kennedy has found consistent with equal protection. Just as the admissions program in Fisher was for Kennedy the unique constitutionally permissible use of race, the Texas abortion law struck Monday contains for Kennedy the rare unconstitutional abortion regulation.   In Planned Parenthood v. Casey, Kennedy provided the pivotal vote affirming the core holding of Roe v. Wade to guarantee women a constitutional right to abortion before fetal viability.  But before and after Casey, Kennedy consistently voted to uphold state regulations of abortion including requirements that women undergo a waiting period before obtaining an abortion, that minors notify or obtain the consent of parents before obtaining an abortion, that doctors provide women information about abortion before performing the procedure, and that state funds and state personnel could be prohibited from providing abortions or counseling about abortion.   In Gonzales v. Carhart, Kennedy wrote the majority opinion finding constitutional a federal ban on the procedure known as   abortion.  Before this term, the only regulation Kennedy considered an ”undue burden” was in Casey, when he struck Pennsylvania’s requirement that married women notify their spouse about an abortion. After 24 years, in Whole Women’s Health v. Hellerstedt Kennedy found additional undue burdens in Texas requirements that physicians performing abortions have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles and that facilities providing abortions meet the same standards as all facilities performing ambulatory surgeries.  At oral argument Kennedy explored delaying enforcement of the requirements and returning the case to a lower court for more information about the effect of these regulations on women’s access to abortion.  Ultimately, he joined Justice Stephen Breyer’s majority opinion to conclude each of the challenged regulations ”provides few, if any, health benefits for women” and ”poses a substantial obstacle to women seeking abortions.”  For other controversial cases this term, the   Court avoided divisive, definitive rulings.  In U. S. v. Texas the Court divided   leaving in place a federal appeals court’s injunction preventing the Obama administration from implementing its deferred action program (DAPA) to allow immigrants who are parents of American citizens to remain in the country lawfully.  In Zubik v. Burwell, where religious nonprofit groups challenged accommodations offered by the Obama administration to the Affordable Care Act’s contraceptive mandate, the Court without reaching the merits agreed unanimously to return the case to lower courts to find a compromise. In contrast, Fisher and Whole Women’s Health could not be so clearly left for someone else to decide.  With Justice Kagan recused from Fisher, a   decision was impossible, and a 2013 Supreme Court decision written by Kennedy had already returned the case to the district court once for a new trial.   ”Under the circumstances of this case,” Kennedy writes, ”a remand would do nothing more than prolong a suit that has already persisted for eight years and cost the parties on both sides significant resources.” In Whole Women’s Health, a   split would simply have affirmed the appeals court decision and upheld Texas’s law with no rehearing. Kennedy’s liberal outcomes in the recent abortion and affirmative action cases follow a path opened by his broad rhetoric in earlier opinions    rhetoric that until now has run counter to his votes. They also demonstrate that he and this shorthanded Supreme Court can only avoid resolving divisive constitutional questions for so long. Join us on Facebook. .

Jason Day to miss Rio Olympics over Zika virus scare,CNN,,2016-06-28," (CNN) He’s the best golfer on the planet    but Jason Day won’t be winning Olympic gold anytime soon. The world. No. 1 withdrew from Rio 2016 Tuesday after citing fears over contracting the Zika virus. His move comes after   major winner Rory McIlroy pulled out this month for similar reasons, while several other of the sport’s big names have also said they won’t travel to South America. While the symptoms of the virus    which include a rash, headaches and joint pain    aren’t severe, Zika has been linked to microcephaly in newborn babies and some cases of the   disease   syndrome in adults. Read: Tiger   The Olympics deserves the best players, ”The reason for my decision is my concerns about the possible transmission of the Zika virus and the potential risks that it might present to my wife’s future pregnancies and to future members of our family,” Day said in a statement published on his Twitter account. ”I have always placed my family in front of everything else in my life. Medical experts have confirmed that while perhaps slight, a decision to compete in Rio absolutely comes with health risks to me and my family. My wife Ellie and I have been blessed with two wonderful and healthy children and our plans is to have more. ”While it has always been a major goal to compete in the Olympics on behalf of my country, playing golf cannot take precedent over the safety of our family. I will not place them at risk.” Read: McIlroy pulls out of Rio Games, The Australian, who won his first major at the 2015 PGA Championship, is the latest   for golf’s   returned to the Olympics, having last featured in 1904.   major winner Vijay Singh and and Australia’s Marc Leishman both cited Zika, as did former U. S. Open champion Graeme McDowell    whose wife is pregnant, and who declined the chance to replace McIlroy in Ireland’s team. Ireland has also lost Shane Lowry, ranked 25 in the world, after he confirmed he would not be traveling to Brazil on Tuesday. Lowry, who tied for second at the U. S. Open, also cited fears over the Zika virus for his withdrawal. Leading South African players Louis Oosthuizen    the 2010 British Open winner    world No. 12 Branden Grace and 2011 Masters champion Charl Schwartzel have also decided not to compete.  With former Masters winner Adam Scott also out, Australia would not have an eligible player inside the top 75 if the team was selected on this week’s rankings. Former world No. 1 Tiger Woods has questioned the quality of the field that will take part on Rio de Janeiro’s new course in August. The qualifying format    four players per country from the world’s top 15, plus two players per country outside that    also devalues the competition, according to the American. ”I know they have to try to have four guys from each country participate, but I just wish they would have had more quality of a field similar to what we face in major championships or the World Golf Championships or the Players,” said the    who is still recovering from back surgery and will not take part in Brazil. ”I think the Olympics deserve that.” Have your say on golf at the Olympics on our Facebook page, Get more golf stories, Read more: CNN’s Olympics coverage"
Can corrupt politicians still be locked up?,CNN,Danny Cevallos,2016-06-28," (CNN) Can corrupt politicians still be locked up now that the Supreme Court on Monday unanimously redefined the rules in vacating the 2014 federal conviction of former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell? McDonnell had been indicted for honest services fraud and Hobbs Act extortion charges in connection with the acceptance of $175, 000 in loans, gifts, and other benefits while in office. The head of the   company Star Scientific, Jonnie R. Williams, wanted the state’s backing for his effort to get federal approval for a dietary supplement he sought to produce.  According to the U. S. Solicitor General, McDonnell and his wife Maureen ”solicited and secretly accepted more than $175, 000 in money and luxury goods . .. The funds included loans, deluxe shopping trips, golf outings and a Rolex watch” in return for agreeing to ”use the power of his office to help Williams’s company.”  In order to convict, the prosecution had to prove McDonnell committed an ”official act” in exchange for the loans and gifts.   But McDonnell said he actually never took any official action on behalf of the company. So what is an ”official act”?   An ”official act” is defined in the law as ”any decision or action on any question, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy, which may at any time be pending, or which may by law be brought before any public official, in such official’s official capacity, or in such official’s place of trust or profit.”  That’s pretty broad.  And any time criminal laws are broad, there’s room for expansive readings and selective prosecutions.   In this case, according to the prosecution, McDonnell’s ”official acts” included arranging meetings, hosting events and ”contacting other government officials.”   That’s the problem with broadly drafted laws: they cover bad behavior and a lot of other behavior too. Obviously, if the governor had commandeered the National Guard to spy on a wealthy donor’s   in exchange for a bag of cash, well, that’s the kind of official corruption we want to avoid.  But what about the case where a donor —  also a constituent —  merely voices his opinion on an issue and the official also advocates a similar view?    If you are a governor, faced with a criminal definition like that, would you feel confident that you know what conduct is allowed and what isn’t?   The very essence of politics is quid pro quo —  Latin for ”something for something”.   Why do people donate to presidential or gubernatorial campaigns in the first place?  It’s not because they’re charitable folks. If so, they’d donate to the United Way or the Red Cross.  People donate to politicians because they are looking to buy a little influence here and there.  It’s hard to craft criminal laws that filter out corruption from legal donations. Certainly, there’s corruption that should be prosecuted.  For example, if state employees are bribed to issue drivers licenses to   truck drivers, that’s bribery. It’s especially bad if those   drivers hurt someone. Corruption can directly hurt citizens by providing them inferior government services, which is why it’s understandably a top priority for the DOJ.      But introducing people?  Arranging a meeting?  Those are the kinds of things politicians do all the time, as part of their job.  Under the law as the DOJ has interpreted it, if those actions are beneficial to a donor, or to someone who has given anything of value to the official, it’s potentially criminal.  The ”quid pro quo” requirement for corruption convictions is notoriously minimal. Concededly, it is tough to determine whether an official action was taken because of a gift, or because the official simply believed it was the best course of action. Congress decided to address this problem and draft the   laws, not with a scalpel but with a battle axe.   The statutes on bribery, extortion and  similar laws contain inclusive, nebulous definitions, while offering little guidance on the difference between politics as usual, and a federal indictment.  When it comes to corruption, the Department of Justice is limited not by the U. S. Code, but by the U. S. attorneys’ own discretion and resources.   Monday, the Supreme Court finally reeled it in . .. a little.  While it was an   decision, it could hardly be said that the Court ratified McDonnell’s conduct in office.  Indeed, the decision leaves open the possibility of McDonnell’s conviction after a new trial if prosecutors could produce stronger evidence. The Court narrowly ruled that the jury instructions did not adequately guide the jurors on the term ”official act” in the federal bribery statute.     The Court held that an ”official act” is a formal exercise of governmental power on a ”question, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy,” that may be brought before that official.  And if that definition is still hazy, the Court offered some clarity on McDonnell’s case: setting up a meeting, talking to another official, or organizing an event  —   without more  —   does not fit that definition of ”official act.” Let’s face it.  More than ever, the public has a dim view of politicians.  And there has been plenty of corruption in government.  The solution, however, is to ferret out the truly criminal activity  —   not to simply pass laws that make everything illegal, thereby giving the DOJ unfettered power to convict anyone it chooses.  The very job of being an elected official means marshaling your influence on behalf of your constituents’ desires . .. how are we to know where the line is between illegal and legal conduct?   Usually that guidance comes too late, in the form of a knock on your door by the FBI, or a secret grand jury indictment.  Before the McDonnell case, every phone call answered or meeting arrangement was potentially criminal  —   just by virtue of the conversation itself.  Now, after McDonnell, phone calls and meetings are . ..well, actually. .. they are still potentially criminal, depending on the facts and additional evidence in each case. And even with this ruling, the DOJ still has plenty of other broadly drafted statutes at its disposal in the fight against corruption. Join us on Facebook. .

U.S. officials: Russian warship came dangerously close to Navy ship,CNN,Barbara Starr,2016-06-28," (CNN) A Russian warship approached within 315 yards of a U. S. Navy warship in the eastern Mediterranean Sea earlier this month in what U. S. officials say was a series of unsafe maneuvers.  The USS Gravely was in the Mediterranean on a routine patrol June 17 to provide protection for the aircraft carrier Harry S Truman as part of Operation Inherent Resolve to counter ISIS. It was approached by the Russian   frigate, according to U. S. officials.  The Russian vessel made repeated passes behind the Gravely within its wake. At one point, the Russian ship pointed toward the Truman, the officials said. The Gravely eventually accelerated speed and moved ahead, with the Russian ship still following it before breaking off. ”As Gravely changed course and speed, the Neustrashimyy also changed course and speed. The maneuvering demonstrates that the Neustrashimyy was not in fact restricted in her ability to maneuver, and was thus intentionally displaying a false international signal,” a U. S. defense official said. The official said the Neustrashimyy had raised an international signal a ship displays when restricted in its ability to maneuver when she took position two nautical miles off Gravely’s starboard quarter. Then the Neustrashimyy repeatedly asked Gravely over radio to maintain a safe distance while the Neustrashimyy continued to maneuver to get closer to Gravely. The official added that the encounter lasted for more than an hour. U. S. officials say they have served noticed to Moscow protesting the incident as unsafe. The U. S. is also objecting to published statements from the defense ministry that claim it was the U. S. that engaged in unsafe seamanship. The Russian news agency RT posted a video of a portion of the encounter that the Pentagon says fails to show the Russian actions and improperly and incorrectly shows the Americans appear to be at fault.  Pentagon officials say they had not been fully aware of the details of the June incident until the Russians this week began to discuss it in the media. The encounter comes after several aerial close calls between Russian jets and U. S. military assets earlier this year. In April, Russian jets in two separate incidents performed ”barrel rolls” over U. S. Air Force aircraft, and earlier that month, two Russian jets flew closely to the U. S. Navy missile destroyer USS Donald Cook."
"Lighthouse Cuban migrants climbed isn’t ’dry land,’ judge rules",CNN,Catherine E. Shoichet,2016-06-28," (CNN) The lighthouse that a group of Cuban migrants scaled in an attempt to reach the United States isn’t ”dry land,” a federal judge ruled Tuesday.   The decision means 24 migrants who’ve been detained for more than a month on a U. S. Coast Guard cutter will be processed for repatriation back to Cuba, the agency said in a statement. Last month the migrants climbed the    American Shoal Lighthouse, an iron structure about 6. 5 miles south of the Florida Keys. The Coast Guard convinced them to come down after a standoff that lasted for hours.  Since then, the group has been the focus of a fierce legal battle that shines a spotlight on the U. S. immigration policy known as ”wet foot, dry foot.” The   policy gives Cubans who’ve set foot on American soil the chance to stay in the United States, while those intercepted at sea are sent back.  The approach has become increasingly controversial amid what officials say is a surge of Cubans trying to reach the United States. The spike, analysts say, is fueled largely by fears that U. S. policies that help Cuban migrants once they make it to the United States could disappear as relations between the two countries thaw. Judge: Lighthouse landing like being intercepted at sea, In his ruling Tuesday, Judge Darrin P. Gayles sided with the U. S. federal government, concluding that the Coast Guard had made a reasonable decision when it intercepted the Cubans and treated them as ”wet foot” migrants. ”As an abandoned —  and dangerous —  structure over seven miles from the closest dry land, no one today would live on the Lighthouse. It has never been connected to dry land, and even at the lowest tide the water is still at least four feet deep,” Gayles wrote in his order. ”Because the Migrant Plaintiffs here would necessarily require transportation from the Lighthouse to the mainland in order to survive, landing on the Lighthouse is essentially no different than having been interdicted at sea.” Lawyers representing the migrants had argued they’d effectively landed on U. S. soil when they climbed the lighthouse, and therefore should be allowed to stay in the country. ”We are very disappointed,” attorney Kendall Coffey said in an email after the judge’s ruling Tuesday.  Gayles said in his order that human rights abuses exist in Cuba, and acknowledged that the migrants set out from the island with dreams of reaching freedom and opportunity in the United States. But they didn’t make it to dry land, he said, and it isn’t the court’s role to reshape immigration policy. ”The Court neither approves nor disapproves the Executive Branch’s decision that the Cuban migrants in this case do not qualify for refugee processing as dry foot arrivals to the United States,” Gayles wrote. ”Developments and revisions of immigration and foreign policy are left to the political branches of the government.” Read the judge’s decision, Next steps, The migrants next ”will be processed for repatriation under standard U. S. immigration policy,” U. S. Coast Guard Petty Officer Eric Woodall said in a statement.  ”Individuals must have a visa or other permission to travel to U. S. and anyone located at sea will be returned to their country of origin in accordance with immigration laws,” he said. But the leader of the   group that filed the lawsuit on behalf of the detained Cubans said he’s still holding out hope. Lawyers representing the migrants plan to file an emergency motion to block repatriation while they continue to fight the case in court, said Ramon Saul Sanchez, who leads Movimiento Democracia. ”We are disappointed with the ruling . .. but that is just one part of the case,” Sanchez said. ”We still have legal avenues at our disposal.” ’I can’t even get up’ Maria Elena Lopez started to read about the judge’s decision Tuesday, but quickly pushed herself away from the computer. ”I couldn’t finish reading the message. . .. I’ve been in bed since I heard about it,” she told CNN. ”I can’t even get up.”  Lopez lives in Jacksonville, Florida. Her son, Alexander Vergara Lopez, is one of the migrants who climbed the lighthouse last month. For weeks he’s been held on a Coast Guard cutter. She doesn’t know where he is and hasn’t been able to speak with him.   But she’s been shopping for clothes for her    son and hoping the judge would give him and the other 23 migrants the chance to stay in the United States.  ”I already had the suitcase ready. I already could see myself with him,” she said Tuesday. Lopez said now she’s praying for a miracle. ”As long as they are not sent back to Cuba,” she said, ”we will still have hope.” Setting a precedent? The legal battle is bigger than the Florida courtroom where lawyers made their case, Muzaffar Chishti, director of the Migration Policy Institute’s office at NYU School of Law, told CNN earlier this month. ”The U. S. government does not want this case to be a foothold for a surge in future migration,” Chishti said. The number of Cubans coming to the United States is already on the rise. Analysts say the spike is fueled largely by fears that U. S. immigration policies which favor Cubans could be on the verge of changing now that relations between the two countries are on the mend. While immigrants from other countries seeking asylum in the United States often struggle to make their case in court, Cubans don’t have to jump over the same hurdles. The Cuban Adjustment Act, passed in 1966, gives any Cuban who sets foot in the United States permission to enter. After a year and a day in the country, they’re eligible to apply for a green card. Other government policies grant them benefits like food stamps, Medicaid, housing assistance and work permits soon after their arrival. ”They never know when the door may close,” Chishti said. ”Many of them are not taking any chances.” More than 35, 600 Cubans have arrived at U. S. ports of entry since October 1, and the numbers show no sign of slowing. ”There is a massive exodus taking place,” Sanchez said. The migration, he said earlier this month, is fueled by oppression in Cuba, not U. S. policies. ”They decided to risk their lives. Those risks are decided by thousands of people every year. It’s not something to take lightly,” he said. ”People don’t come here just to eat well. . .. There’s a lot of other things that are happening there.” Last flight, first steps: ’Historic’ surge of Cubans crossing into U. S."
Mallows Bay: The ’ghost fleet’ graveyard where nature has risen from the dead ,CNN,,2016-01-08," (CNN) They were built to sail across the Atlantic Ocean to aid the allied effort in World War I, but wound up unused, abandoned, stripped and finally scuttled. Almost a century on, the ”ghost fleet” of Mallows Bay in the Potomac River, 30 miles south of Washington D. C. is positively brimming with life again. Nature has taken hold amid the rotting hulls and rusted bows of the scores of historic vessels, with flora and fauna inundating the areas where sailors and passengers once stood.  ”It has become this really amazing mecca for wildlife,” Joel Dunn, president and CEO of Chesapeake Conservancy, told CNN.   ”You’ve got these osprey nests on the front of the boats, and heron rookeries, bats breeding in the hull of the ships    it’s a really rich wildlife and historical location.”    Located near Nanjemoy in Charles County, Maryland, Mallows Bay is not only treasured by locals    it could be on the brink of wider recognition thanks to efforts to designate it a national marine sanctuary.  It is one of two sites    the other is on Lake Michigan in Wisconsin    being considered for sanctuary status by NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration). The announcement made by President Obama in October 2015 was the first time since 2000 that an official nomination for national marine sanctuary status had been made.    If successful, Mallows Bay will join 14 existing ecological havens including the Florida Keys and Thunder Bay in Lake Huron    one of the five Great Lakes    where nearly 100 vessels have been discovered to date, earning it the nickname ”Shipwreck Alley.”  Don Shomette, a marine archeologist helping efforts to get Mallows Bay listed as a protected site, is quietly confident the bid will succeed.     ”I took some folks from NOAA down there and they were stunned when they saw the place,” Shomette told CNN.    ”We have 185   shipwrecks in a    area, which makes it one of the most   places in the western world for historic vessels.”  Ghosts from the past  Shomette is the author of ”Ghost Fleet of Mallows Bay And Other Tales of the Lost Chesapeake”    a book borne of a   attachment to the site which began on a camping trip with his father in the 1950s. ”I was just into my teens. We went down the river in a small boat and camped at an old civil war wharf    which is still there,” Shomette recalls. ”We told ghost stories that night and the next morning the river was covered with fog  —   you couldn’t see more than two feet. ”We started downriver and ran into a waterman and he said: ’Are you boys going to see the ghost fleet?’ And it sent shivers down my spine.  ”About 10 minutes later we came underneath the bow of one of the ships looming out of the fog. It was just one of those memorable moments in a young boy’s life.” Several years later, Shomette conducted a painstaking survey of the site which revealed the presence of a confederate blockade runner from the American Civil War.  Another, the Accomac, a   ferry built in 1928, saw service in World War II before winding up in Mallows Bay in 1973 after it was decommissioned following a fire on board. The majority of ships clustered in Mallows Bay, however, date back to the early 20th century. The   ”ghost fleet” was part of an unprecedented shipbuilding program undertaken by the U. S. to assist its European allies during World War I.  ”When America entered the war in April 1917, two out of four ships leaving a British, French or Italian port was being sunk,” Shomette explains. ”So the process of continuing the war was going to go in Germany’s favor.” Germany’s tactic of ”unrestricted submarine warfare” targeted not just military vessels but merchant and passenger ships too  —   the R. M. S. Lusitania, torpedoed in May 1915, was the most   sinking, killing around 1, 200 on board    10% of them Americans. ’A million men building ships’ With the allies needing boats, and fast, President Woodrow Wilson answered the call for help, setting up the Emergency Fleet Corporation to build and operate merchant and military fleets. ”Within a year we had a million men building ships, cutting the timber, mining the iron for them, building the machinery for them. At one point we became the greatest shipbuilding nation in the history of the world,” Shomette says.  ”We had to create from nothing a shipping industry that was going to build a thousand wooden ships in 18 months    normally it would take a year and a half to build a wooden steam ship.”  At Hog Island in Pennsylvania, one of three major steel shipyards built by the government, 50 shipways extended for a mile and a quarter down the Delaware River. At its peak, its   workforce was launching vessels every five to six days. Contracts to build the wooden cargo ships were sent out to shipyards across the U. S. There were eight different designs ranging between   feet (  meters) in length.  Nearly 400 were completed before the end of the war in November 1918. A handful were sold, some finding work ferrying cargo up and down the Pacific coast and to South America, Shomette says. But for longer, transatlantic trips they were considered uneconomical because of their size     they could only carry around 1, 800 tons of freight. In 1922, the majority were sold for a song to the Western Marine  Salvage company, which set about stripping out reusable metals and parts before burning and sinking the remains.  The company went bust at the start of the Great Depression in 1929, and wildcat salvagers moved in to pick away at the scraps. In the early 1940s, Bethlehem Steel    America’s largest shipbuilder at the time    set about what proved to be another doomed salvage operation. Back to nature, The vessels have since slowly slipped into nature’s grasp, in some places completely consumed, almost unidentifiable.  ”At low tide all you see is these forest of things sticking up and at the north end of the bay,” Shomette says.  ”It looks like shore, but it’s ships    bow to stern, bow to stern    I call these the flowerpot ships. Each of those ships have become islands    some have trees   feet tall . .. It’s very exotic, it’s just beautiful.”   In the wider Chesapeake Bay area, ospreys have thrived in recent years after almost being wiped out by the pesticide DDT during the   century.  The unique habitat of Mallows Bay has helped them and other birds of prey rebound in population since the agricultural insecticide was banned in the U. S. in the early 1970s.   ”They’re sort of symbols for the Chesapeake Bay in a sense and a symbol for what the environmental movement can do when they put their minds to it,” conservancy chief Dunn says.  ”To be able to see them on every dock, post and shipwreck in the Chesapeake is heartening and a story of great educational value for the public at large.” Local streams also support rare fish species such as the longnose gar and the warmouth, says Dunn, and Chesapeake Bay is an important nursery habitat for striped bass. ”The Potomac River is a treasured resource. It’s one of the major contributors of freshwater to the Chesapeake and it has this wonderful combination of history, recreational opportunities and natural beauty,” Dunn adds.     For Shomette, the educational benefits are key to the overall strategy plan. Along with encouraging more tourists to visit the area, he wants to see more kids kayaking around the vessels, like he did all those years ago, watching the ships and wildlife evolve.  ”One of the things we want to do is adopt a ship for the high schools, so a school can go out to its ship to find out what plants are growing, what features are devolving, what features are disappearing, occupation of birds,” he says.  ”It would also contribute to the   assessment of that ship.”  Several hurdles remain before Shomette and Dunn can start celebrating, but they have reason to be optimistic of a positive decision next year. According to the Chesapeake Conservancy, more than 60 local organizations and constituents have already backed the proposal, and the response from two public meetings held locally in November has further buoyed their mood.  ”After the environmental impact statement and the public comment period, which is over on January 15, we can move forward. And hopefully we will have a dedication, if everything goes right, on the anniversary of the U. S. entry into WWI.  ”It’s why we built the greater part of the vessels that are there.”  Click here for more information on the historic vessels in Mallows Bay"
Dems-GOP squabble stalls Zika funding,CNN,Ted Barrett,2016-06-28,"Washington (CNN) Efforts to combat the Zika virus stalled in the Senate Tuesday when Democrats blocked a $1. 1 billion   funding bill, escalating the political battle between the parties over how to respond to the looming public health crisis.  The bill    which was put into final form in negotiations between House and Senate Republicans but not Democrats    fell eight votes short of the 60 it needed to advance. Congress now has just a narrow window to find a compromise before departing Washington in   for a lengthy recess. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell,   said it was ”absurd” Democrats filibustered the bill and said he hoped they would feel pressure as they explained to their constituents this weekend why they voted against the money. McConnell said he would schedule a vote on the bill again next week.  Democrats said they opposed provisions blocking funds for Planned Parenthood and freezing some environmental regulations to allow for spraying of the mosquitoes that carry the virus. They accused Republicans of inserting those ”poison pills” to secure the backing of   Republicans in the House at the expense of being able to pass it in the Senate. Top Democrats sent a letter to GOP leaders seeking fresh negotiations on the bill. While McConnell appeared wary of new talks, others GOP senators, like Roy Blunt of Missouri, who has been heavily involved in the issue, acknowledged they would be necessary. ”We have to deal with this. Everybody understands that this has to be dealt with,” Blunt said. Republicans argued that they had met the funding level acceptable to Senate Democrats and charged that Democrats backed off the bill because of pressure from special interests, like Planned Parenthood. ”This is purely and simply about politics on the part of the Democrats. And worse yet, special interest politics that has gotten in the way of what’s in the best interest of the safety and health of the American people,” said Sen. John Thune,   Dakota. The rhetorical attacks were surprisingly harsh    even for this divided Congress    as each side blasted the other’s handling of the issue as motivated more by base politics than the health care needs of women who if infected with Zika can have children with serious birth defects. ”Republicans decided they’d leverage a national health emergency and a public health crisis to sneak in special interest poison pills,” said Sen. Chuck Schumer,   York. ”It is completely unacceptable, actually shameful, hypocritical, cynical for the Democrats to block this funding at this time,” said Sen. John Cornyn,   who earlier gave a lengthy floor speech while standing next to a blown up photo of a baby with a shrunken head due to microcephaly, the birth defect linked to Zika.   ”We all realize what a threat this is to the public health and safety of women in the United States,” he said."
How to fight environmental crime,CNN,,2016-06-06," (CNN) The ramshackle corrugated roofs that shelter the Benfica Market in Angola stand in stark contrast to the ordered rows of gleaming ivory trinkets on the tables underneath. The trinkets are carved from tusks taken from the carcasses of elephants killed for their ivory.   Sadly, the demand for ivory products like these has triggered a spree of elephant killing across Africa. Some 100, 000 elephants were butchered between 2010 and 2012 by poachers desperate to profit from the rising demand for ivory in Asia. Markets like Benfica    the largest in southern Africa    alongside others in Nigeria and South Sudan are at the heart of this gruesome trade.  That is why Angola’s recent announcement that it will take steps to shutter the Benfica market is a large stride forward in the country’s efforts to end a trade that threatens one of the animal kingdom’s most magnificent creatures it’s a courageous move that serves as a powerful symbol of what can be achieved when governments act.  But in the meantime, the killing continues, aided by corruption and weak law enforcement. Simply closing markets will not be enough to end the illegal trade in wildlife, nor will it be enough to end the broader problem of environmental crime, which is rapidly becoming one of the most significant threats to global security. From the trafficking of hazardous waste to the illegal sale of gold and other minerals, environmental crime is on the rise across the world. International criminal gangs, rebel groups and   fraudsters are increasingly taking advantage of lax laws and   law enforcement agencies to reap huge profits from a crime that destroys vital ecosystems and threatens to wipe out species.  The value of environmental crime is now growing at a rate up to three times that of the global economy, according to a report recently released by UNEP and Interpol. Estimates of the value of environmental crime range from between $91 billion and $258 billion, 26% higher than previously estimated in 2014. Even at the low end, it has outpaced the illegal trade in small arms to become the fourth largest criminal enterprise in the world after drug smuggling, counterfeiting and human trafficking.  The silent victims of this crime are the forests, marine ecosystems, animals, plants, corals and rivers targeted by criminals for the profits they generate. Not only are these profits enormous, but the financial fallout is equivalently large: the total cost in terms of the damage done to ecosystems from environmental crime stands at billions of dollars annually.  But there are human victims, too. The profits from environmental crime breed insecurity around the world. Civil wars, criminal cartels, and even terror groups such as ISIS are funded by proceeds from illegally traded natural resources. Illegal gold mining in Colombia, for example, is now considered the easiest way to launder money from the country’s drug trade.   There are also indirect impacts. The loss in government revenue from environmental crime is thought to range from $9 billion to $26 billion every year. This is money that could be spent training teachers, building infrastructure, and protecting ecosystems from the very crime that is destroying them.  How can we respond? Combating environmental crime requires a multipronged approach.   First, the international community must move to strengthen the environmental rule of law    improving legislation and effectively penalizing      if it is to succeed in disrupting overseas tax havens used by environmental criminals to launder illicit profits.  Second, to combat environmental crime more directly, governments need a more cohesive approach. Brazil has already proved that this approach works. Robust command and control centers, improved intelligence gathering, the use of satellites and increased enforcement of protected areas resulted in a crackdown on criminal cartels that resulted in deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon being reduced by 76%.  And since much of this crime is transacted across national frontiers, law enforcement agencies need to improve the gathering, analysis and sharing of intelligence on environmental crime at an international level.   Finally    and perhaps most urgently    we need to eliminate demand for the products that come from this type of crime, like the ivory trinkets found in markets across Africa. We can do this by raising consumer awareness of the tragedy of environmental crime.   In an effort to do just this, the United Nations recently launched one of the most ambitious awareness campaigns in years targeting the illegal trade in wildlife, encouraging people to find their own kindred species and use the hashtag #WildforLife to spread the word about the enormous impact of the trade.  The reality is that the sheer extent of environmental crime means that we cannot solve this problem overnight. But every day without action is a day that our ecosystems suffer    and also the people who rely on them for their livelihoods. We all need to commit to bringing environmental crime to an end. It is only through collective action that we can stop this tragedy.  Join us on Facebook. . Read CNNOpinion’s Flipboard magazine."
Lawmakers urge FDA to lift blood ban for gay men,CNN,,2016-06-28," (CNN) Two Democratic lawmakers joined the Progressive Change Campaign Committee and others Tuesday in urging the Food and Drug Administration to change its blood donation policy.  The FDA restricts gay men who have had sexual contact with another man in the past 12 months from giving blood.  One of the lawmakers to speak Tuesday, Colorado Rep. Jared Polis, who is openly gay, has been fighting to overturn this policy. Florida Rep. Alan Grayson, who represents Orlando, suggested using this month’s Pulse nightclub shootings to show renewed respect for people’s rights. He said blood donation screening should be based on science and a donor’s safe and monogamous sexual behavior, no matter their orientation.    After the shooting, which killed 49 people and injured dozens more, Orlando’s OneBlood donation center put out an immediate call for donors to help the hospitals working with the influx of injured. Its Twitter feed specified an ”urgent need for O Neg, O Pos and AB Plasma donors.” Yet friends, loved ones and even spouses of those injured were unable to give blood, Polis said.  In the conference call, Polis said it’s time for the FDA to update their restrictions and immediately address this problem. In 1983, in response to the   epidemic, the FDA implemented a policy banning donations from men who have sex with men (called MSMs) women who have sex with MSMs and transgender people. The FDA’s recommendation attempted to safeguard the national blood supply by ”indefinitely” deferring donations from populations considered to be at high risk.  Officially, in September 1985, the FDA recommended that ”blood establishments indefinitely defer male donors who have had sex with another male, even one time, since 1977 . .. due to the strong clustering of AIDS illness and the subsequent discovery of high rates of HIV infection in the population.”  The FDA updated its   policy in December when it recommended that men who have sex with men be deferred 12 months since their last sexual contact with another man. At the time, the American Medical Association commended the agency for ending the lifetime ban.  ”The AMA has been a strong advocate for eliminating public policies that do not align with scientific evidence and best ethical practices in public policy,” the group stated.  The Human Rights Campaign said the change was a ”step in the right direction” but added that the new policy ”still falls short of a fully acceptable solution because it continues to stigmatize gay and bisexual men.” Each unit of blood donated in the United States must undergo a series of tests for infectious diseases, including Hepatitis B and C, HIV and syphilis, as defined by FDA policy. The FDA told CNN that it carefully considered alternative criteria, including individual risk assessment for HIV, instead of the current   deferral for MSMs. ”However, evidence shows that   presents significant issues,” the FDA said. Specifically, the truth and reliability of   of monogamy    in any type of sexual relationship    present a problem.  For now, the agency said it continues to review its donor deferral policies to ensure that they reflect the most    scientific knowledge.  ”This process must be   so the timeframe for future changes is not something we can predict,” spokeswoman Tara Goodin noted.  With assistance from the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, the agency has also implemented a safety monitoring system that will provide crucial information to inform policy actions.  On Tuesday, Polis and Grayson joined the National Gay Blood Drive and over 130 members of Congress in petitioning the FDA to change its policy and screen donors ”based on behavior, not sexual orientation.” ”A discriminatory FDA ban that requires gay men to be celibate for one year to donate meant that thousands of   healthy donors were turned away from Orlando blood banks that desperately needed their blood,” commented Courtney Hagen of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. ”Their community was under attack, but they were unable to do even the simplest of acts to help it heal.” "
Benghazi scandal: How did we get here?,CNN,Ryan Browne,2016-06-28,"Washington (CNN) The U. S. mission in Benghazi, Libya was attacked and burned on September 11, 2012, resulting in the deaths of U. S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and another State Department employee. Armed militants also attacked a nearby CIA annex with mortar fire, killing two additional Americans as security personnel engaged in a pitched battle with the attackers.   What have been the main controversies? The first major point of contention was whether the violence was a premeditated terror attack or a spontaneous response to an   video mocking Islam, as some in the Obama administration initially claimed and top officials, such as   to the UN Susan Rice, repeated in talking points approved by the White House. Republicans charged that Rice and other figures were misleading the public for political reasons. As details of the events emerged, critics raised additional questions about whether the State Department had provided adequate security at the outposts in   Benghazi and whether some   officials on the ground or in Washington told   security forces to ”stand down” rather than offer support while U. S. personnel were still under fire. RELATED: Benghazi panel caps   probe: No bombshell, faults administration, In the wake of the attacks, multiple investigations have been conducted to determine what went wrong. Republicans have consistently blamed   of State Hillary Clinton, while Democrats have pointed to the role of   State Department and security officials. A State Department Accountability Review Board investigation was launched soon after the incident, followed by several congressional inquiries. The most recent, by the Select Committee on Benghazi, discovered in the course of its review that Clinton had used a private email server to conduct official business while running the State Department. What happened today? House Republicans from the Select Committee released an   report covering a   investigation of the Benghazi attacks Tuesday. Republicans say that the latest investigation has yielded new witnesses and new revelations. House Democrats, however, put out their own report Monday accusing the GOP of wasting taxpayer money on a political exercise whose goal was to tarnish Clinton. Two members of the committee, Republicans Mike Pompeo and Jim Jordan, released their own account of the events taking a much harsher line against the administration, accusing Clinton and President Barack Obama of a ”tragic failure of leadership.” What does the report say? The report contains no bombshell revelations, nor any new evidence of wrongdoing by Clinton, but it does fault the Obama administration for security lapses. The dossier paints a picture of bureaucratic ineptitude, a rapidly worsening security in Libya and inadequate resources in the months that led up to the killing of Stevens and his three colleagues. The report details numerous requests the embassy made to bolster the security presence in Benghazi but finds that those requests were either ignored or rejected by officials in Washington. The report does not lay the blame for these failures on Clinton but on   officials. It also highlights the military’s inability to react quickly to the events on the ground, noting that it took over six hours for military assets to deploy after   of Defense Leon Panetta had ordered a military response. However, it appears that the infamous ”stand down” order was never given, though some of the CIA security contractors who were the first to respond to the attacks said that their station chief had told them to wait while additional resources could be marshaled. The report provides testimony that State Department officials knew that the protests had been overly emphasized in administration messaging but the responsibility for the talking points was placed with the CIA. What about Clinton’s role? The report says that Clinton and a top aide, Patrick Kennedy, should have realized the risks posed to the Benghazi mission by extremist groups given that available intelligence indicated Libya was a terrorist ”safe haven” and suggested an attack was possible. ”It is not clear what additional intelligence would have satisfied either Kennedy or the Secretary in understanding the Benghazi mission compound was at risk    short of an attack,” the report says. The report also says that one of the reasons Stevens was at the mission in Benghazi was to help prepare for a trip that Clinton was planning to Libya in October, suggesting that could have contributed to keeping an unsecure facility active. Why is this happening now? The committee wrapped up its work in time for the nominating conventions    giving Republicans an opportunity to hammer Clinton about Benghazi throughout the entire general election. Though Republicans have denied a political motivation for the select committee’s work, and Chairman Trey Gowdy won’t talk politics, GOP members launched into their attacks right away. The   report calls Clinton’s leadership ”morally reprehensible.” The committee claimed in a news release that the report ”fundamentally changes the public’s understanding of the 2012 terrorist attacks that killed four Americans.” In reality, it fleshes out the same overall narrative that other investigations have found    in time for Republicans to use those details against Clinton. What does this mean for Clinton? Almost nothing. The committee didn’t drop any damaging new findings into the 2016 presidential election    and that’s good news for Clinton. But the impact of Benghazi, much like her use of a private email server, is already baked into polling results that show her struggling to be viewed as trustworthy.  Clinton’s campaign dismissed the committee as ”partisan,” and that’s how the report will be seen by Democrats. Still, by issuing the report, Gowdy’s panel thrust the issue of Benghazi back into the spotlight, and its findings won’t stop Republicans from attacking Clinton over her actions. That much was made clear by Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, who tweeted upon the report’s release: ”Hillary Clinton was in charge, knew the risks,  did nothing. The report makes clear we can’t afford to let Clinton be   .” What are the potential next steps? The report isn’t official until the committee votes to accept it, which is expected in early July. But its release means the deepest,   investigation into the Benghazi incident is finished.  If Democrats get their wishes, voters will see House Republicans as having overstepped    launching a   investigation and spending more than $7 million, only to replicate the findings of earlier investigations. That Jordan and Pompeo decided to release their own report to complement Gowdy’s suggests there was division within the GOP’s ranks over just how far to go in criticizing Clinton and Obama    a key possibility to watch as the impact of the report becomes clear in the coming days."
"Clinton, allies to hit Trump with $13M in ad spending next week",CNN,Theodore Schleifer,2016-06-28,"Washington (CNN) Next week is shaping up to inflict the most dramatic damage on television yet to Donald Trump’s campaign, with forces behind Hillary Clinton planning to outspend him by $13 million, a wider gap than any week so far. Clinton’s campaign has reserved about $7. 5 million in advertising time the week of July 4, according to advertising records reviewed Tuesday by   Media, a company that tracks political advertising. Clinton’s super PAC, Priorities USA, plans to spend $5. 5 million, with both groups devoting most of their cash to Florida and Ohio. The billionaire’s campaign has yet to air a single   advertisement, and has none booked for next week, according to   Media, nor do any of his super PACs. Trump has not bought TV advertising since early May spots in Indiana and Nebraska. Trump’s campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Trump, who reversed his pledge to   his campaign after securing the Republican presidential nomination, is trying to assemble a fundraising operation at an unprecedented speed. The candidate and his joint fundraising committee with the Republican National Committee raised at least $11 million as of last week. As of the end of last month, his campaign had only $1. 3 million in its coffers, compared to $42 million for Clinton, according to Federal Election Commission filings.  Traditional Republican interest groups are not giving Trump any cover, either. The Freedom Partners Action Fund, a super PAC financed by the political network of Charles and David Koch, began a $3. 9 million advertising round this week    but for Senate candidates in Ohio and Nevada, not for the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. The Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC tied to Republican strategist Karl Rove, announced Tuesday that it would reserve about $40 million in advertising for Senate candidates this fall. Rove’s allied groups that typically back the Republican presidential nominee have not yet engaged on Trump’s behalf."

"Conservatives blast Clinton, Obama for ’tragic failure of leadership’",CNN,Stephen Collinson,2016-06-28,"Washington (CNN) Two top Republicans on the House Benghazi Committee blasted Hillary Clinton and the Obama administration Tuesday for ”a tragic failure of leadership” in the   to the deaths of four Americans in the U. S. outpost in Libya in 2012. Reps. Mike Pompeo,   and Jim Jordan,   accuse the administration of covering up the true nature of the attack on Benghazi to avoid damaging President Barack Obama’s   race. The hardline conservatives, who were among Clinton’s toughest questioners during her testimony before the committee last year, released their own account of the attacks to complement the panel’s overall report. ”What we did find was a tragic failure of leadership    in the run up to the attack and the night of    and an administration that, so blinded by politics and its desire to win an election, disregarded a basic duty of government: Tell the people the truth,” the congressmen wrote. ”And for those reasons Benghazi is and always will be, an American tragedy.” Their decision to release an addendum to the main report appears to suggest that Pompeo and Jordan believe the committee report does not go far enough in criticizing Clinton and the administration. ”The overall report, it’s about the facts, what happened,” Jordan told Chris Cuomo Tuesday on CNN’s ”New Day.” ”But Mr. Pompeo and I thought it was important to ask the questions. Why were we still in Benghazi when almost every other country had left? Why did we stay in Benghazi when the security situation was so terrible, so dangerous? And why did the administration mislead us?” The congressmen write that the administration did not do all it could to save Americans under attack in Benghazi on September 11, 2012. They also say the administration failed to bring all the perpetrators to justice and accuse Democrats of blocking the   probe. Clinton on voters’ trust issues: ’I know I have work to do’ The conservatives specifically accuse Clinton of doing nothing to improve security in Benghazi, a lapse that they blame for the deaths of Ambassador Chris Stevens and three compatriots during the attacks on a U. S. outpost and a CIA annex. The analysis includes some explicit criticism of Clinton that is likely to be fuel presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump’s charges that she is responsible for the deaths in the attack, which was first thought to be a protest but then proven to be a terrorist assault.  Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon blasted the committee in an overnight tweet. ”Far from honoring the four brave Americans who died, the Benghazi Committee has been a partisan sham since its start,” he wrote. Democrats release Benghazi report  The analysis from Pompeo and Jordan details a memo from   Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs Beth Jones, which painted a picture of worsening security conditions across eastern Libya.  Clinton argued during her   grilling before the committee last October that no recommendations were made to her from State Department experts or the intelligence community that U. S. facilities in Benghazi or Tripoli should be abandoned on the basis of the assessments. But the   report argues that by August 17, 2012, ”it had become a situation that now demanded leadership by the Secretary of State herself    leadership that did not sit back and wait for a recommendation.” Is Donald Trump right about Hillary Clinton?  It was now time for Clinton to show ”leadership to upgrade the facility or get our people out . .. ” ”She had the last, clear chance to order an immediate closure of the Benghazi facility yet did nothing and four Americans died.” The document examines the issue of whether U. S. forces in Europe or the United States were ever deployed in a bid to aid Americans in Benghazi. The report related how former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta testified that he had ordered three assets to deploy, a Marine   support team, a unit known as a Commanders in Extremis force and a U. S.  hostage rescue team. The congressmen say that Americans had been told by the administration that the military could never have reached Benghazi in time to help the beleaguered Americans with jets, drones or personnel. But the analysis says fighter planes and armed drones never left the ground and planes carrying the rescue teams did not take off until hours after the attack was over. Trump attacks Clinton: CNN’s Reality Check Team Inspects  ”We are now convinced, contrary to the administration’s public claim that the military did not have time to get to Benghazi, that the administration never launched men or machines to help directly in the fight.” ”That is very different from what we have been told to date,” the analysis continues. The congressmen also rebuke the military, saying the Pentagon failed to provide the committee with lists of planes that could have reached Benghazi or an inventory of armed drone assets. GOP seizes on recently surfaced video to hit Hillary Clinton on trade  Democrats point to previous investigations conducted by the House Armed Services Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Senate Intelligence panel that concluded that when the U. S. consulate in Benghazi came under attack the military commanders did what they could under the time and distance constraints to respond. Those investigations did not find any evidence that there was a   ”stand down” order given by someone in the government or military that prevented any U. S. forces from getting to the site to help save anyone under attack as some conservatives have claimed. Republicans have long sought to prove that Obama, Clinton and other senior members of the administration were asleep at the switch during the Benghazi attack and did not do enough to save Stevens. The congressmen conclude that Panetta met Obama in the early evening of September 11, 2012, about the attack but did not have any further contact with him for the rest of the day. Plot Trump’s path to 270  The report says Clinton and Panetta did not speak at all about the unfolding crisis and Clinton did not speak with Obama until 10:30 p. m. that night    six hours after the attack began and five hours after Stevens went missing. The committee contrasts the level of administration engagement with the famous picture of the Obama war cabinet pictured in a Situation Room annex during the raid to kill Osama bin Laden. ”Benghazi should have merited the same level of attention and urgency,” the excerpts from the analysis said. Democrats accuse Committee chairman, South Carolina Rep. Gowdy and other Republicans on the panel of using the investigation to directly target Clinton and of seeking to wound her presidential ambitions. Democrats released their own prebuttal of the Gowdy committee report on Monday, accusing the GOP of wasting public money on a political witch hunt and of seeking to wound their party’s presidential nominee with their probe."
Pro-choice? You might also be pro-gun.,CNN,,2016-06-28," (CNN) As many applaud the Supreme Court’s decision yesterday in Whole Women’s Health v. Hellerstedt to roll back state abortion restrictions, perhaps they should consider how the high court could likewise roll back state gun restrictions using a similar rationale. It’s a broad analogy, but an important one. In 1973 in Roe v. Wade, the court decided that the right to privacy under the 14th Amendment included a woman’s right to have an abortion. Similarly, decades later in D. C. v. Heller and McDonald v. Chicago, the high court decided that the Second Amendment right to bear arms included an individual’s right to own a gun. Taken together, whatever you may think about the accuracy of these rulings, Roe and   cement the individual’s right both to have an abortion and own a gun. For both of these fundamental rights the court will scrutinize and oftentimes strike down any state regulation that burdens them. It is worth considering whether those applauding the court for upholding the right to choose would do so tomorrow if the constitutional right at stake was the right to own a gun. The Supreme Court decided yesterday in the Whole Woman’s Health case that two provisions in a Texas state law unduly burdened a woman’s choice to have an abortion. The first required that abortion providers have admitting privileges to a hospital within a   radius, while the second made abortion centers subject to the same health codes as surgical centers, where doctors perform procedures not requiring an inpatient hospital stay.  In analyzing these requirements, the court asked whether they placed an ”undue burden” on the woman’s right to have an abortion    a standard derived from the 1992 decision Planned Parenthood v. Casey. Casey reads in part: ”Unnecessary health regulations that have the purpose or effect of presenting a substantial obstacle to a woman seeking an abortion impose an undue burden on the right.” This is not to say all limitations on abortion are unconstitutional. Indeed, Casey itself upheld the states’ right to require informed consent, parental consent, and a   waiting period, among others. Using this test, the court held this week in Whole Woman’s Health that ”neither of these provisions offers medical benefits sufficient to justify the burdens upon access that each imposes.” But if the Texas laws aimed at health reform unduly burden the right to choose, it is important to consider how state gun control laws could likewise infringe upon the right to bear arms. Decided in 2008 and 2010 respectively, Heller and McDonald enshrined individual ownership of firearms as a constitutionally protected right. Like the ”right to choose,” the right to a firearm is not limitless. Indeed, Heller itself states: ”Like most rights, the right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited.”   But both sets of cases, pertaining to abortion and guns, beg this question: what are the outer bounds of limitation? For instance, is Maryland’s ban on assault weapons permissible? Can the county of San Diego only permit residents to carry firearms upon a showing of ”good cause”? At the appellate level, assault weapons bans and good cause requirements have been struck down by some circuit courts and upheld by others, but the Supreme Court has yet to speak on them, leaving the outer bounds of limitations on the Second Amendment hazy at best.  These boundaries remain blurry because with regard to the Second Amendment, the test of proper limitation is not so   as the ”undue burden” standard involved with the ”right to choose.” Where Casey provided the ”undue burden” test in the realm of abortion, neither Heller nor McDonald provided a test or what lawyers would refer to as a ”standard of scrutiny” when addressing guns. What McDonald did seem to suggest, however, was that the right to bear arms was a ”fundamental right,” therefore triggering the very strict test of ”strict scrutiny” for all gun regulations. Indeed, famed constitutional law scholar Eugene Volokh argues just this point: ”McDonald’s conclusion that the right is fundamental. .. might lead courts to apply strict scrutiny.” Now, it is entirely fair to question whether abortion or gun ownership are in fact constitutional rights at all. For instance, I would argue that the right to have an abortion is not a constitutional right, and thus Roe should be overturned. In the converse, many Democrats do recognize gun ownership as a fundamental right, and it is at that point that gun ownership attains vigorous protections, protections that might mean sacrificing partisan interest and the rolling back of some   gun control.  In a world of strict scrutiny, a state ban on assault weapons or a state ”good cause” requirement for attaining a concealed carry license, would face steep uphill battles with the court and could very likely be struck down, much like this week’s abortion restrictions. In the event that that does happen, I suspect we will see a reverse reaction from the Democrats who are praising the court for pushing back on state abortion laws. Whatever your partisan affiliation, it is worth considering the overarching constitutional principles involved in any given Supreme Court precedent. Should the high court be able to roll back state health regulations whose efficacy was at least debatable? If your answer is yes, logical consistency should encourage you to apply this same logic to the court’s consideration of   gun control. Join us on Facebook. .

Poll: Clinton extends lead over Trump,CNN,Gregory Krieg,2016-06-29," (CNN) Hillary Clinton leads Donald Trump by six points, 44% to 38% in a Fox News poll of registered voters released Wednesday, marking an uptick from similar polls released in May and June. The Fox News results follow a rough patch for the Trump campaign: In May, the presumptive Republican nominee enjoyed a   lead in the same survey. But by early June, those numbers had flipped, with Clinton jumping out to a 42% to 39% advantage. CNN’s Poll of Polls    an average of results for the five most recent publicly released national polls that meet CNN’s standards for publication    has Clinton leading Trump 46% to 40%. Her lead among women in this latest round    51% to 32%    outpaces Trump’s with men, where his edge has dwindled to 10 points, 46% to 36%. The state of the race remains essentially unchanged when Libertarian Gary Johnson is thrown into the mix. Johnson wins 10% of the vote in a   competition, taking about equally from Trump and Clinton, whose lead scales down to 41% to 36%. Despite having seen off his last primary rival nearly eight weeks ago, Trump also lags behind Clinton on the party unity front. His lead among Republicans is down to 74% from 82% in May. And only 52% of registered GOP voters who had previously supported one of his opponents picked the billionaire businessman over Clinton. On the Democratic side, Bernie Sanders voters appear more willing to shed their primary loyalties and back the party’s likely nominee.   of the Sanders backers surveyed said they would vote for Clinton over Trump. Overall, 83% of Democrats plan to support Clinton in November. The Fox News’ poll was conducted between June 26 and 28 among 1, 017 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide, and has a margin of error of    3 percentage points. "
ISIS’ Ramadan terror campaign,CNN,Peter Bergen,2016-06-29," (CNN) In the past two weeks, ISIS has conducted lethal terrorist attacks in Bangladesh, Iraq, Jordan, Yemen, and also, very likely, in Saudi Arabia and Turkey.  On Thursday, a senior government official said there is strong evidence of ISIS involvement in planning the attack on the Istanbul airport. Still, ISIS has not claimed responsibility for the most lethal terrorist attack ever at an airport.  On Friday, ISIS did claim responsibility for the attack by multiple gunmen at a café in the diplomatic area of Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, that killed twenty. On Saturday ISIS also claimed responsibility for a suicide car bomb attack in Iraq’s capital Baghdad that killed at least 125 people, including 25 children.  On Monday suicide attackers targeted the US consulate in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, a Shia mosque in Qatif in eastern Saudi Arabia, and Saudi security officers in Medina, the   site in Islam, killing four. While ISIS has not claimed responsibility for these attacks, it is unlikely that any other jihadist group would carry out a suicide attack in Medina, given its sacred status. For ISIS the targets selected for attack are key targets for the group: the Shia, Americans, and the Saudi government. None of this should be too surprising. After all, ISIS explicitly called for terrorist attacks during the holy month of Ramadan, which commenced four weeks ago. Abu Muhammad   the spokesman for ISIS, released an audiotape in late May in which he called for attacks, saying, ”Ramadan, the month of conquest and jihad. .. make it a month of calamity everywhere for the  .”  Seemingly a result of that call, ISIS or its affiliated groups started carrying out multiple attacks across the Middle East. Suicide attackers blew themselves up in a Christian village in Lebanon close to the Syrian border, killing five people. Last week, a wave of ISIS suicide attacks in Yemen in the southeastern city of Mukalla killed more than 40. ISIS claimed credit for a suicide attack that had recently killed seven Jordanian security personnel at a border crossing between Jordan and Syria. The Istanbul airport was attacked by three suicide bombers who were almost certainly dispatched by ISIS. In the past three weeks,   attackers also struck in the West, first in Orlando, Florida, where 49 people were killed in a gay nightclub    the most lethal terrorist attack in the United States since      and, the day after the Orlando attack, an ISIS terrorist killed a police official and his partner in a town outside Paris. For Islamist terrorist groups such as ISIS, the holy month of Ramadan    a time of fasting and prayer for the vast majority of Muslims    is seen as a particularly auspicious time to launch terrorist attacks. This is especially the case around the 27th day of Ramadan, the ”Night of Power,” which is a particularly sacred day for the world’s Muslims as it was the time that the Prophet Mohammed started receiving the first verses of the Koran.  On the Night of Power in 2000, which that year fell on January 3, al Qaeda militants attempted to launch a suicide attack against the American warship USS The Sullivans off the coast of Yemen with a   boat. The attack failed.  This year, the 27th day of Ramadan fell on July 2. This is the same day that the ISIS attackers in Bangladesh completed their massacre at the restaurant in Dhaka. The militants were all killed by Bengali forces. The 27th day of Ramadan is also the same day that ISIS launched the attack that killed more than 200 in Baghdad. If indeed the attacks at Istanbul’s airport are the work of ISIS, it would fit into the terrorist organization’s current strategy to attack commercial aviation targets. In March, two ISIS suicide bombers launched the attacks at the Brussels airport that killed 15.  In October, ISIS’ Egyptian affiliate brought down a Russian commercial jet leaving Sinai airport, killing all 224 people on board, the deadliest attack on commercial aviation since  . ISIS also has ample motivation to want to attack Turkey. Where the Turks once had a   attitude to the tens of thousands of ”foreign fighters” who have transited Turkey to join ISIS in neighboring Syria, now the Turks have substantially cut down on ISIS recruits traveling though their country. In 2015, ISIS, in one of its English language online publications, advised   foreign fighters hoping to join the group that, ”Turkish intelligence agencies are in no way friends of the Islamic State [ISIS].” Turkey has also allowed the United States to fly bombing missions aimed at ISIS from airports on Turkish soil.  Join us on Facebook. . Not coincidentally, the latest wave of attacks comes as ISIS continues to suffer reversals on the battlefield in both Iraq and Syria. Indeed, last month Gen. David Petraeus, the former U. S. commanding general in Iraq, predicted in an interview with me that ISIS could lose its de facto capital, the important Iraqi city of Mosul, before the end of the Obama administration’s term in January 2017.  Such battlefield losses may serve to accelerate   and   attacks outside of Iraq and Syria."
Make UK the 51st state,CNN,,2016-06-29," (CNN) Can we all just calm down for a second? Can we stop making a tempest in a Twinings teapot? Yes, with the ”Brexit” vote, the United Kingdom has voted to leave the European Union. Yes, the British pound lost value as a result of this news. Yes, world markets fell in response to this uncertainty.  But you know what? Currencies rise and fall. Stocks go up and down. This is not a   London Blitz.  It’s not a repeat of the worldwide depression of the 1930s, when Britain’s industrial production fell by 16. 2 percent.  Nor is it a crisis on par with April 10, 1970, when Paul McCartney announced his solo album, signaling the breakup of The Beatles. Let’s understand this moment for what it really is: an opportunity for the United Kingdom to become the 51st state of America.  The EU’s loss is our gain. Call it the ”Brentrance.” As King George once said (at least in Broadway’s Hamilton) ”Oceans rise, empires fall   We have seen each other through it all.” Isn’t it time we joined forces again? There are four irresistible reasons why the UK should join in a permanent political and monetary union with the United States.  First, there’s trade. Why was the UK an EU member in the first place? It wanted easy access to a huge trading bloc  —   the biggest in the world. However, U. S. GDP is only slightly below the EU’s economic output. We’re No. 2! In fact, by some estimates, California by itself is the world’s   economy.  Second, there’s regulation. The Brits were sick and tired of being told how curvy bananas could be and whether eggs could be sold by the dozen. But by becoming the 51st state, the Brits would get   trading with all other U. S. states, without the pesky regulations. We’re so lax about regulation, we let kids eat mac and cheese with Yellow Dye No. 5 and No. 6  —   both banned in Europe!  Third, there’s travel. Sure, as EU members, Brits have been able to get into the fast lane at European airports, making it practically effortless to see the Parthenon in Greece or the Colosseum in Rome. But do they know there’s a   replica of the Parthenon in Nashville, Tennessee? And did they forget about the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, which has been called ”the greatest stadium in the world” by the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum website?  And speaking of travel, let me say this to the Brits: Do you have any idea how easy it will be at American airports when you have a U. S. passport? Do you have any idea how much faster the verbal abuse will go by when you’re American? The last time I traveled and was mocked by airport security for not knowing how many ounces my   mouthwash could be, I thought to myself, ”This would surely take much longer if I weren’t a U. S. citizen.” Fourth, there’s the overwhelming embrace Americans would give the Brits. We love everything the Brits do, everything the Brits make, and everything the Brits say (or at least the way they say it). I have friends on all sides of the political spectrum, and there’s one thing they all agree on: The UK is awesome. From Shakespeare to Sherlock, from the Royal Albert Hall to the royal family. And speaking of the ”royals,” Queen Elizabeth II and company could simply merge with America’s royal family  —   the Kardashians. They have about the same power over the government, and they’re just as much fun to photograph. Join us on Facebook. . Read CNNOpinion’s Flipboard magazine."
Sonia Sotomayor channels liberal voice on Supreme Court,CNN,Ariane de Vogue,2016-06-29," (CNN) On the losing end of a   decision regarding police searches without a warrant, Sonia Sotomayor last week unleashed a withering dissent. With direct references to Ferguson, Missouri, and a reading list of black authors including   Coates and W. E. B Du Bois, Sotomayor took the majority to task for ignoring the realities on the ground.  ”This case allows the police to stop you on the street, demand your identification, and check it for outstanding traffic warrants    even if you are doing nothing wrong,” she told her audience. And then she took things a step further, rejecting the majority’s contention that the stop at hand could be considered an isolated instance. ”We must not pretend that the countless people who are routinely targeted by police are ’isolated,” she said. ”They are the canaries in the coal mine whose deaths, civil and literal, warn us that no one can breathe in this atmosphere.”   Sotomayor in fiery dissent: Illegal stops ”corrode all our civil liberties” To some, she has become the liberals’ answer to the late Justice Antonin Scalia, asking tough questions of lawyers and delivering fierce opinions with    at times    searing language.     ”Like Justice Scalia, Justice Sotomayor has the ability to take on her colleagues on the court when she thinks they are wrong, while at the same time speaking to the public at large in colorful, evocative, often fiery language,” said Elizabeth Wydra, president of the progressive Constitutional Accountability Center.  Sotomayor, who completed her seventh term on the bench Monday, is known for her personal journey from the housing projects to the highest court in the land, but her dissent reflects something else she brings to the table: Her years working in the trenches as an assistant district attorney and trial judge, experiences that shaped her view on the law.  Last term, according to the Supreme Court observer Scotusblog, she agreed with Scalia only 45% of the time    they were ideological opposites. But they shared a trademark of sorts    a broad appeal off the bench. Scalia became a hero to conservatives after 30 years on the high court for reviving and defending the judicial philosophy of ”originalism” which stresses that the Constitution should be interpreted as it was written.  Sotomayor has emerged as a hero to an audience emboldened by her life story and the direct language of her opinions that sometimes focus on those she feels might be underrepresented.  She agreed with her liberal colleagues more than 80% of the time last term. She is on a similar course this term, but has written alone at times, with a more personal style than Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Elena Kagan and Stephen Breyer. She also is not shy to speak candidly in public.  In a stunning moment of candor in 2015, she admitted that she feels at times like an outsider on the bench.  ”Do you feel like you belong?” she was asked at a 2015 talk at the University of Notre Dame.  Her simple answer: ”No.”  ”I’m very different than my colleagues,” she said. She noted that she is a part of the conversation as they all try to sort out cases, but many of them worked before at the federal level with jobs in government that she never had. To laughter, she added, ”I’m louder than most of them, there’s a little bit of that fiery Latina in me.” ”Will I ever quite feel that I have their same background, their same understanding of the world that I operate in? Not really.” She refers to herself as ”Sonia from the Bronx.” In her 2013 memoir    ”My Beloved World”    she chronicled the unusual path that led her to become the first Latina on the high court. She wrote about how affirmative action changed her life.  ”Much has changed,” she wrote in the thinking about affirmative action, ”since those early days when it opened doors in my life.” ”But one thing has not changed: to doubt the worth of minority students’ achievement when they succeed is really only to present another face of the prejudice that would deny them a chance even to try,” she wrote.  Two years ago, she wrote a stirring dissent when the court upheld an amendment to Michigan’s Constitution that prohibited state universities from considering race as a part of the admissions process. ”Race matters to a young woman’s sense of self when she states her hometown, and then is pressed, ’No where are you really from? ’” Sotomayor wrote in her dissent on Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action.  Opinion: Diversity made a difference for me in college, ”Race matters to a young man’s view of society when he spends his teenage years watching others tense up as he passes, no matter what neighborhood he grew up in,” she added. She also took Chief Justice John Roberts to task for something he’d written in an earlier case. ”The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discrimination on the basis of race,” he wrote. John Robert’s challenging 2016, Sotomayor’s response: ”The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to speak openly and candidly on the subject of race, and to apply the Constitution with eyes open to the unfortunate effects of centuries of racial discrimination.” When the court took up Fisher v. University of Texas, a challenge brought by a white woman who said she was denied admission based on her race in violation of the equal protection clause, Sotomayor was prepared. She dominated the questions at oral argument concerning the school’s admissions policy, which takes race into consideration as one factor. Abigail Fisher’s lawyer was not arguing that race could never be taken into consideration, only that the university’s program was flawed. But Sotomayor pressed him on his motive, digging deep, asking him if, in his view, he thought any program that took race into consideration ”could ever survive.” In a surprise, a   court last week upheld the school’s affirmative action plan. A different kind of diversity, Although most of her colleagues served only on appellate courts, Sotomayor’s experience was in some ways closer to the law’s impact. Her professional background brings a different kind of diversity to the bench. ”You can have more lofty views about the basic good in the system, if you come to it at the top,” she told Linda Greenhouse, a senior fellow at Yale Law School in 2014. ”If you’re someone like me who worked in the trenches, what you have experienced gives you a wider breadth of expectations.” She referred to that experience in the Fourth Amendment case. WATCH: What happens when the Supreme Court ties, In 2006, Edward Strieff was stopped by an officer and asked for his identification. When the officer ran the name through a police database the officer found an outstanding warrant for a traffic violation. Pursuant to the warrant, he arrested Strieff, conducted a search and discovered drugs. Strieff argued the evidence was inadmissible.  Clarence Thomas, writing for the   majority ruled against Strieff and said that police could use the evidence that was obtained after an illegal stop. The officer, Thomas wrote, had made ’ ’ mistakes.  Sotomayor wasn’t having it. She said she was ”drawing on her professional experiences” to conclude that ”unlawful ’stops’ have severe consequences much greater than the inconvenience suggested by the name.” There’s a high number of outstanding warrants that could trigger similar searches, she said, choosing Ferguson, Missouri, to make her point. The town has population of 21, 000 with 16, 000 outstanding warrants, she said, citing a Justice Department report. The defendant in the Utah case was white, Sotomayor noted. But she continued, ”it is no secret that people of color are disproportionate victims of this type of scrutiny.”  It’s a theme of hers that has come up before. In the case    concerning the 4th Amendment    she spoke directly to her reader. ”For generations,” Sotomayor wrote, ”black and brown parents have given their children ’the talk’    instructing them never to run down the street always keep your hands where they can be seen do not even think of talking back to a stranger    all out of fear of how an officer with a gun will react to them. ” Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor dish out Supreme Court lunchroom secrets, And in case the majority needed a reading list, she provided one. Du Bois for ”The Souls of Black Folk,” Michelle Alexander’s ”The New Jim Crow,” James Baldwin’s  The Fire Next Time,” and Coates’ ”Between the World and Me.” The case also illustrated how Sotomayor’s approach sometimes differs from her liberal colleagues. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg did not join the most searing section of the opinion. But Ginsburg did choose to join a separate dissent written by Justice Elena Kagan in full. Kagan    one of the best writers on the Court    who manages to brilliantly distill complicated legal issues    made clear where the majority had gone wrong in the case. She said in part that the court  was wrong to chalk up the officer’s mistakes as innocent.  ”Far from a Barney   mishap,” Kagan wrote. The officer made a ”calculated decision” with ”little justification.”  (Kagan pointed out that the court had established a framework to determine whether to exclude evidence obtained through a Fourth Amendment violation. She said ”suppression is necessary when, but only when, its societal benefits outweighs its costs. ”)  But the language of Kagan’s opinion lacked the fire coming from Sotomayor. Sotomayor wrote alone again this term, when the Court granted a police officer qualified immunity against a civil rights suit. The case concerned a police chase of Israel Leija Jr. who had an outstanding warrant for his arrest and led police offices in Texas on an 18 mile high speed interstate chase in 2010. Eight is Enough? Supreme Court adjusts to the new normal, Leija called a dispatcher and threatened to shoot police officers chasing him. As he approached an overpass, officers set up tire spikes hoping to disable his vehicle. Trooper Chadrin Mullenix had a different tactic. Armed with a service rifle, he fired from the overpass six shots and killed Leija before his car reached the spikes. Leija’s estate sought to sue Mullenix, and a lower court ruled the officer was not entitled to qualified immunity. The Supreme Court reversed the opinion without holding hearings.  Sotomayor dissented, arguing the officer’s conduct was rogue and he had acted ”without any training” in that particular tactic and against the wait order from his superior officer.  ”By sanctioning a ’shoot first, think later’ approach to policing, the court renders the protections of the Fourth Amendment hollow,” she said. ’Wise Latina’ At her confirmation hearing in July 2009, Sotomayor was criticized by Republican senators for comments she had made before her nomination. ”I would hope that a wise Latina woman, with the richness of her experiences, would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasn’t lived that life,” Sotomayor said in a 2001 speech delivered at the University of California, Berkeley, School of Law.  Sotomayor explained to the senators that  she was trying to inspire students and young Latino lawyers to ”believe that their life experiences would enrich the legal system” but she said that her words had created misunderstanding.  ”I want to state up front, unequivocally and without doubt, I do not believe that any ethnic, racial or gender group has an advantage in sound judging,” she said.  ”Do you believe that it is ever appropriate for judges to allow their own identity politics to influence their judgment?” Sen. Chuck Grassley, now the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, asked. ”No sir, absolutely not,” she responded."
EgyptAir 804: Recorder shows signs of smoke,CNN,,2016-06-29," (CNN) The flight data recorder on doomed EgyptAir Flight 804 indicates possible lavatory and avionics smoke before the plane plummeted into the Mediterranean Sea, the nation’s civil aviation ministry said Wednesday.   Additionally, wreckage from the Airbus A320’s front section showed ”signs of high temperature damage and soot,” the ministry said in a statement.  What caused the plane carrying 56 passengers and 10 crew members to plunge to the sea on May 19 remains a mystery, but the latest information could bring investigators closer to determining a cause.    ”We now know that there was some form of either smoldering or some form of fire or some form of combustion, if you like, on that plane, and that has been verified,” CNN aviation analyst Richard Quest said. The recorded data was consistent with information from the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System, or ACARS    which sends messages between planes and ground facilities    indicating ”lavatory smoke and avionics smoke,” according to the ministry.   ”Analysis will be carried out to try to identify the source and reason for those signs,” the statement said. Evidence from the wreckage will enable investigators to build a forensic picture of what occurred. ”We will know whether this was a bomb or whether it was a fire,” Quest said.  The flight data recorder holds 25 hours of technical information from plane sensors, including air speed, altitude, engine performance and wing positions. The cockpit voice recorder captures flight deck sounds, including crew conversation, alarms and background noises. Authorities are still trying to repair the voice recorder’s damaged memory chip at the French version of the U. S. National Transportation Safety Board.  The   black boxes offer the best clues to determining why the plane went down while en route from Paris to Cairo.  ”This is an amazing development taking us ever closer to learning what happened,” Quest said of the new evidence. ”We can’t say whether it was nefarious or mechanical.”  The flight was at 37, 000 feet when it lost contact above the Mediterranean, shortly before the aircraft entered Egyptian airspace. Then, the FDR stopped recording.  ”That’s significant,” Quest said. ”What that tells me is that whatever happened to the plane, happened at that altitude. It was dramatic. It was sudden and the plane then plunged.”   In the hours that followed the disappearance, Egyptian officials said it was far more likely that a terrorist attack brought down the plane, than a technical fault. But they didn’t elaborate, or present evidence for that claim.  To this day, there has been no claim of responsibility by any terrorist organization. The black boxes were recovered by the crew of the John Lethbridge, a privately owned   survey and recovery vehicle contracted by Egypt’s government to aid in the search. Crews are continuing to search for wreckage and the victims’ remains. Egypt’s military also spotting wreckage, personal belongings including an uninflated life vest, a seat, a purse, shoes, carpet, a scarf, parts of chairs and cushions and a sling bag. The EgyptAir label appeared on one piece of wreckage."
Istanbul attack aftermath: Where are airports’ weakest links?,CNN,,2016-06-29," (CNN) Istanbul Ataturk Airport has much tighter security than many other airports around the world    but it still wasn’t enough to stop terrorists from killing dozens of people on Tuesday. Usually, passengers departing from Ataturk Airport must undergo two instances of   screenings. A vehicle checkpoint is also stationed about 500 meters from the international terminal. The international arrival hall however, does not have this same level of security    and is where two of the three suicide bombers are believed to have entered the building. READ MORE: How did attackers get past security? How does this setup compare to airports around the world    and where are some of the soft spots when it comes to aviation security? Security barriers  When it comes to security barriers, does location really make a difference? ”If you go to some other airports in more dangerous parts of the world    such as in Israel, Afghanistan, and Pakistan    you’ll often find that security barriers are quite far outside the actual airport buildings,” said Rafaello Pantucci, director of International Security Studies at the UK’s Royal United Services Institute. ”Even before you get to the building you get your car searched,” he added. While airports such as Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion have wide security barriers    and a reputation for safety    this also presents its own logistical difficulties.  READ MORE: Ben Gurion: The world’s most secure airport?  ”The bigger the perimeter, the more people and resources it requires,” explained Pantucci. ”And if you’re in a hurry, all this security and questioning can get you stuck in a big queue.”  Rafi Ron, former head of security at Ben Gurion Airport, said Tel Aviv’s rigorous approach could be helpful for Istanbul given the high number of terror attacks on Turkey in recent years. ”I think we need to understand that this most recent attack is an escalation,” he said.  ”Both because Istanbul airport is considered much more secure than the Brussels airport or other Western European airports. And secondly, as we can see, the attack was very well planned.” Jeff Price, author of ”Practical Aviation Security: Predicting and Preventing Future Threats,” was cautious about the effectiveness of   barriers in preventing attacks. ”If they move the check point from inside the building to closer to the curb, all that does is relocate the area where people can be attacked,” he said. Road blocks, Cement bollards, the thick,   pillars you see outside the doors of many public buildings now, can also be an effective way of preventing car bombs from entering buildings    though less successful in stopping suicide bombers on foot. ”In the case of the Glasgow 2007 attack (in which a car loaded with explosives was driven into the doors of Glasgow Airport) barriers stopped the car getting into the terminal building,” explained Price. ”So they’re effective for stopping one particular type of attack    and not another.” Inside jobs, Many experts say the biggest threat to airport security is ”insiders”    the staff working within the grounds. ”These are people helping others get into the airport, or getting devices and explosives in,” Pantucci said. ”If you think back to the attacks of the bombing of the MetroJet airplane in Egypt, that was clearly the product of an insider,” he said, referring to the plane that crashed over the Sinai in October 2015, killing all 224 people on board. Price added that there are ”many of us in the industry who believe there needs to be an increase in levels of background checks and vigilance over who works in the system.” Double screening, While both the Istanbul and Tel Aviv airports use a double layer of screening for passengers, this is not standard practice in the United States. ”It involves screening before you get inside the terminal, and then screening before you go out to the plane,” explained Price.  ”So that’s considered a higher level of security screening    I don’t know any airport in the U. S that has that.” READ MORE: How safe are U. S. airports? What about the emotional impact on passengers? Rather than feeling extra safe, travelers could also feel scared or alarmed by a heavy security presence at airports, said Pantucci. ”If you want to be in a country that’s open and attractive to tourism, do you really want to have such heavy security at the airport    which is the first thing people are going to see when they arrive?” ”Their first reaction to your county is, ’Oh look this is a dangerous place’    it’s not really the image you want to get.” Looking ahead, Following the Istanbul attack, Price emphasized the importance of reducing bottlenecks of people in public areas of airports. ”A balance must be obtained between screening passengers for prohibited items, and keeping the screening lines moving, in order to reduce the likelihood of an attack in the public areas,” he said.

The unlikely godfather of the Islamic State,CNN,Thom Patterson,2016-06-29," (CNN) ISIS, perhaps the most feared terrorist group in the world, traces its short history to a man who was a prison gang leader, a high school dropout and an alleged teenage pimp. His name: Abu Musab  . Zarqawi was ” ” and ”incredibly brutal,” said Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn, a retired former director of the U. S. Defense Intelligence Agency. ”He was a dictator with a plan,” Flynn said on CNN’s TV series ”Declassified.” ”His plan was to kill as many people that did not see life the way he saw it, and to change the face and the nature of the Middle East  —   and frankly the Islamic world.”  In the 10 years since Zarqawi’s violent death, ISIS    or the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria    has gathered enough support and weapons to seize territory stretching from northern Syria to central Iraq.  It also controls areas of other nations, and has claimed responsibility for recent terror attacks that have killed hundreds of people in the Middle East and Europe.  ISIS destroys priceless antiquities, holds slaves and uses the internet to lure young women and jihadists from around the world. And it all traces back to Zarqawi, the man who took his name from the town where he was born in 1966: Zarqa, Jordan.  Pimp, bootlegger, thug, Zarqawi reportedly dropped out of high school and gained a reputation as a local pimp, bootlegger and thug, according to more than one biographer.  At age 23, he spent time in Afghanistan and then returned to Jordan, where he was thrown in prison in 1993 for subverting the government and possessing illegal weapons.  Prison life took Zarqawi to another level.  There, he learned the Quran and used his charisma to recruit prisoners for Islamic jihad. A royal amnesty in 1999 freed Zarqawi and allowed him to return to Afghanistan to meet Osama bin Laden. The two terrorists reportedly disliked each other from the start.  By 2003, he was in Iraq. Zarqawi led a ruthless   campaign of coordinated attacks against Iraqi and U. S. targets. He called his group Al Qaeda in Iraq. A targeted U. S. airstrike killed Zarqawi in 2006.  After that, terrorists who went on to lead ISIS took up where Zarqawi left off.  Here are five Zarqawi claims to infamy tied to today’s ISIS: 1. He’s widely acknowledged as the father of ISIS  Zarqawi’s dream about creating an Islamic state has come true, said Flynn. ”When I look at what we’re facing now, I see Zarqawi all over this battlefield. Zarqawi is the father of the Islamic state.”  ”He created something bigger than a small terrorist organization,” said retired U. S. Army Gen. Stanley McChrystal, a top Iraq War commander. ”He created a movement.”  Also important, McChrystal said, is that Zarqawi convinced people an Islamic state was achievable. 2. Zarqawi’s tactics were extreme  —   even for bin Laden  The mastermind of   disagreed with Zarqawi’s strategy of attacking fellow Muslims. ”What he was trying to do was create a civil war between Sunni and Shia,” said McChrystal. Fighting between the two factions created problems for the U. S.  military coalition.  Today, ISIS continues to use these tactics by targeting Muslims who don’t follow its interpretation of Islam.  In March, a man wearing a belt rigged with explosives walked into a soccer stadium full of families about 30 miles (50 kilometers) south of Baghdad and blew himself up, killing at least 25 people and wounding 90 others. ISIS claimed responsibility.  ”What we see ISIS doing now is an escalation of what we saw   do, targeting Muslims first and foremost,” said Amanda Rogers, a research fellow at Georgia State University.  ”This is   101.” 3. Zarqawi almost   changed the course of the Iraq War  ”He was the person that suddenly made it clear we could lose in Iraq,” said McChrystal.  In 2004 in Falluja, U. S. generals saw the war make a huge shift from Saddam Hussein’s former soldiers to forces  —   many of them foreign fighters  —   who were loyal to Zarqawi.  The First Battle of Falluja started as a military response to the brutal killing of four U. S. contractors whose mutilated bodies were hanged from a bridge. Soon, it became a ”siege,” McChrystal said. By the time war planners decided to pause and regroup, 27 American servicemen were dead. When coalition forces returned seven months later, they fought the bloodiest military battle since Vietnam. Flash forward to January 2014.  Falluja was the first Iraqi city captured by ISIS, which used it as a staging area to send suicide bombers to nearby Baghdad. Fighting between Iraqi and ISIS forces for control of the city spiked again this summer. Related story: Iraqi general says Falluja has been liberated, 4. Like ISIS, he beheaded captives and posted video, Zarqawi shocked the world with a string of kidnappings and beheadings    which were then posted online and credited to Zarqawi or his group.  It began with the kidnapping and killing of American contractor Nicholas Berg in May 2004. The barbaric practice was then embraced by ISIS, most notoriously by the terrorist dubbed Jihadi John. He was killed last January in a targeted drone strike in Raqqa, Syria, ISIS’ de facto capital. 5. The U. S. made Zarqawi a worldwide celebrity, Before 2003, Zarqawi wasn’t widely known. But during the   to the U. S.  invasion, Secretary of State Colin Powell tried to gain support during a February U. N. speech, saying multiple times that Zarqawi was a key link between Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein’s regime.  The invasion took place about a month after the speech.  The veracity of that   link has been challenged. Retired CIA operations officer Sam Faddis told PBS’ ”Frontline,” ”We never found any indication that Zarqawi was in Baghdad working for Saddam or linked up with Saddam.” Would the world know Zarqawi’s name if Powell had never mentioned Zarqawi at the U. N. presentation?  If Zarqawi had never risen to infamy, would the Iraq War have played out differently? Would ISIS have ever been born?  We’ll never know.  ISIS spreads its terror worldwide, Now, more than four years after the end of the Iraq War, ISIS has spread around the globe. The terror group has claimed responsibility for the October 2015 Metrojet plane bombing over the Sinai Peninsula, which killed 224 the November 2015 Paris attacks that killed 130 and the bombings in Brussels that killed 32 in March.  A U. S.    coalition has been fighting ISIS from the air and on the ground, killing more than 10, 000 fighters and 20 ISIS leaders, according to a Pentagon estimate released last March. Before the U. S. and other coalition nations began ramping up military involvement against ISIS in the Syria and Iraq region in 2014, ISIS controlled 34, 000 square miles of territory, the Pentagon said.  The recent Pentagon estimate calculated that ISIS has lost 40% of that territory.  Testifying before the U. S. Senate Intelligence Committee on June 16, CIA Director John Brennan revealed that ISIS has about 18, 000 and 22, 000 fighters in Iraq and Syria and has the ability to draw on a ”large cadre of Western fighters” that could attack inside the United States.   The number of ISIS fighters, according to Brennan, far exceeds what al Qaeda had at its height: ISIS has between 5, 000 and 8, 000 fighters in Libya, in addition to 7, 000 in Nigeria, and hundreds more in Egypt, Afghanistan and Pakistan. ”Our efforts have not reduced the group’s terrorism capability and global reach,” Brennan said.

Air Force official: Targeting of ISIS could be better,CNN,Barbara Starr,2016-06-29," (CNN) The Air Force’s intelligence chief gave the   airstrikes targeting ISIS a failing grade in an exclusive interview with CNN. ”I would give us a 5, which means we have a lot of work to do,” Lt. Gen. Robert ”Bob” Otto told CNN on Friday, when asked to evaluate the air targeting on a   scale. ”We are the best in the world at what we do. But there is always room to improve,” he said. Other Air Force officials tell CNN they believe a number of targeting improvements have been made. RELATED: TOP ISIS leader ’critically injured’ in U. S. airstrike, activists say, CIA Director John Brennan acknowledged Wednesday that the United States had room for improvement when it came to taking on ISIS, also known as ISIL or Daesh. The U. S. still has ”a ways to go before we are able to say we have made some significant progress against” ISIS, Brennan said at an event at the Council of Foreign Relations. Brennan said that Tuesday’s terror attack on Istanbul’s Ataturk Airport ”certainly bears the hallmarks of ISIL’s depravity.” Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said Tuesday that ”The signs point to Daesh, but investigation is ongoing.” Brennan said that it was ”not surprising” that ISIS had not yet claimed responsibility, noting that ISIS typically did not claim responsibility for attacks in Turkey because the terror group hoped to still attract sympathizers there. RELATED: Rubio: Istanbul attack ’ ’ Brennan and other officials have said that ISIS’s recent spate of battlefield losses might drive ISIS to strike targets outside its territory. ”To compensate for territorial losses, ISIL will probably rely more on guerrilla tactics, including high profile attacks outside the territory in Syria and Iraq that it currently holds,” Brennan told the Senate Intelligence Committee earlier this month. State Department spokesman Mark Toner made a similar linkage while briefing reporters. ”They’re under pressure. But that does not affect their ability to carry out terrorist attacks either in Europe or elsewhere in the world,” Toner said. ”They are still capable, and in their desperation, even perhaps more willing and liable to carry out these kind of attacks,” he said. But the spokesman for the   coalition, Col. Christopher Garver, briefing reporters on Tuesday, presented a rosier perspective. He said that the air campaign was having a major impact on the terrorist group’s ability to recruit new fighters. ”What are we doing to stop recruitment? I think the No. 1 thing is through   and through   and through   and Mirages and the other aircraft that are conducting strikes,” he said. ”The more we can kill, the more we can destroy Daesh on the ground,” he continued. ”I think we’re doing a good job of convincing people that, you know, being a recruit, being a leader, there’s not a lot of   career options in Daesh.” But Brennan expressed caution. ”Right now I am still very concerned that the   engine of foreign terrorism outside of Syria and Iraq still has a lot of momentum.” He concluded, ”We cannot rest at all. We have to increase our efforts.”"
Istanbul terror attack: 42 killed nation mourns,CNN,Holly Yan,2016-06-29,"Istanbul (CNN) With flags across Turkey at   and the nation observing a day of mourning, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan proclaimed the terror attack on Istanbul’s airport ”will not divide or split our country.” Erdogan promised the government will ”not let down our people.” He said by killing dozens of civilians, including women and children, the terrorists were not true Muslims.  ”This is not Islamic. Taking one person’s life means going straight to hell,” he said Wednesday from the capital of Ankara, adding, ”No terrorist organization will come between what we are.” Erdogan’s televised comments came a day after he said in a written statement that an attack during the final days of the holy month of Ramadan show the attackers had no regard for faith or values. No terror group has taken responsibility for the attack, in which three men arrived by taxi at the international terminal and launched their horror armed with rifles and suicide bomb vests. Speculation, based on the nature of the attack, has focused on the Islamic State, which has struck in Turkey before but rarely taken credit for those bombings. Interior Minister Efkan Ala said ”all information and evidence” points to ISIS. ”But nothing is for certain.” Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said initial findings ”suggest all three attackers first opened fire then detonated themselves.” That method is similar to the mass shooting and suicide bombings at Paris’ Bataclan concert hall last November. ISIS claimed responsibility for that massacre, which left 89 people dead.  ISIS has a history of airport attacks. In March, it claimed responsibility for dual suicide bombings at the main airport in Brussels, Belgium. At least 10 people died in those blasts.  And just like the Brussels attack, the terrorists in Istanbul took a taxi to the airport.  The Istanbul taxi driver was interviewed by police and released, the Turkish state news agency Anadolu reported.  The director of the U. S. Central Intelligence Agency, using another acronym for the Islamic State, said he thinks the terror attack ”certainly bears the hallmarks of ISIL’s depravity.” John Brennan said he wasn’t surprised that ISIS hasn’t said it was responsible. The group rarely takes credit for attacks in Turkey. ”I think what they do is they carry out these attacks to gain the benefits from it in terms of sending a signal to our Turkish partners,” he told an audience at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington, ”(and at) the same time not wanting to potentially maybe alienate some of those individuals inside of Turkey that they may still be trying to gain the support of.” Victims from around the world  The death toll is now 42, according to  Anadolu, which cited hospital sources. The toll rose after a woman died at a hospital in Istanbul. Many of the dead were Turkish, including 10 airport staff members, TAV Airports CEO Sani Sener said.  The attack killed six Saudis and wounded 27 more, the Saudi Arabian Foreign Ministry said.  The other victims included two Iraqis, one Tunisian, one Chinese, one Iranian, one Ukrainian, one Jordanian and one person from Uzbekistan, a Turkish official said. Three of the foreigners had dual Turkish citizenship.  Of the 239 people wounded Tuesday night, 128 remained hospitalized, officials said.  The three terrorists  The assailants have not been identified, but there is a ”strong suggestion that they are foreign,” a senior Turkish government source told CNN.  Experts say Turkey is especially vulnerable due to the variety of terrorists operating there.  ”You cannot protect these airports 100% . .. especially in a place like Turkey, where ISIS has cells everywhere,” said retired Lt. Col. Rick Francona, a former U. S. military attaché in Syria.  ISIS promised an uptick in attacks during the holy month of Ramadan, which is nearing its end.  And the terror group has reason to detest Turkey: The country is helping the U. S.  coalition attack ISIS targets in neighboring Iraq and Syria.  Turkey allows coalition planes to fly raids from its territory.  Adding to the instability: Last year, Turkey resumed hostilities with the PKK, Kurdish militant separatists, after a   cease fire broke down. But over the last few months, ”the Turks have really changed their focus from only the PKK to going after ISIS as well,” Francona said.  Understanding Turkey’s deadly catalog of enemies, Airport reopens quickly, Just five hours after terrorists struck, travelers returned to the site of the carnage    much to the surprise of some critics. ”I find this totally astonishing,” said Professor Larry Kobilinsky of the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. ”I’ve never seen such a massive crime scene looked at for five hours. It’s just impossible. You’re going to compromise, you’re going to contaminate evidence. . .. They should not have turned this open to the public.”  Passengers walked over shards of glass as workers tried to wash away blood at Ataturk Airport.  But the airport’s operator defended its actions and its security, saying it exceeds international standards.  And unlike many American and European airports, ”We have security checkpoints at the entrance of the terminal building,” Sener said.  Those extra measures didn’t stop the bombers, who started firing   rifles immediately after getting out of a taxi, Sener said.  Despite the horror and carnage, ”Everything’s quite calm right now, which is a little surreal as opposed to the scenes we saw here last night,” witness Laurence Cameron said.  ”I was in the airport this morning looking for my lost luggage,” he said. ”They were sweeping up debris, and someone had hung up a big Turkish flag, pretty much right at the spot where (a) bomb had gone off    sort of an act of defiance, which was quite moving.” Soner Cagaptay, director of the Turkish Research Program at the Washington Institute, said he believes the attack was designed to hurt Turkey’s tourism industry, which brings in more than $30 billion in revenue per year, according to its government. ”I think this was a deliberate effort on behalf of the Turkish government to give a message outside,” he said of the airport’s reopening. ”Because if ISIS, by carrying out the attack, tried to undermine Turkey’s image as a place that’s safe for business and safe for visitors, by getting the airport up and running and functioning in less than a day after the attack, Turkey’s basically saying, ’Never mind, this was just a lapse, we’re back in business. ’” A few shops inside the airport remained closed Wednesday, but for the most part the terminal where the attack took place was open. The only area that was closed was where one of the bombs went off. It was cordoned off by boards with advertisements on them. There was a memorial in front of one food stand, a black table covered with roses and a photo of two of Tuesday’s victims. Lots of blood, broken glass, The cacophony of gunfire Tuesday night was quickly followed by the deafening blows of three explosions.  Witness Sue Savage said about 30 people were herded into a women’s prayer room until authorities led them out and down an escalator into the main terminal hall. Coverage from CNN Turk, ”There was a lot of blood,” she said. ”There was so much glass on the floor, they were scuffing it aside so we didn’t slip.” Video from inside the terminal shows the bright orange flash of fire from one of the explosions. Victims stagger. Some fall on the slippery,   floor. Another video shows a gunman dropping his weapon when he’s apparently shot by a security officer. The man slumps to the ground, and the officer briefly stands over him before running.  About 10 seconds later, a bomb detonates.  8 attacks so far this year  Turkey has spent much of this year reeling from terror attacks as it weathers bombing campaigns by both ISIS and Kurdish militants. The attack marked the eighth suicide bombing event in Turkey this year. At least 140 people have been killed.  The violence has also rattled Turkey’s tourism industry, a key sector of the national economy. About 39. 4 million people visit each year."
Trump says GOP rivals who broke pledge ,CNN,Jeremy Diamond,2016-06-29," (CNN) Donald Trump on Wednesday said his former Republican primary rivals who have refused to support him in November should be barred from running for public office again. ”They signed a pledge saying they will abide, saying they will back the candidate of the party,” Trump said during a campaign appearance in Bangor, Maine, adding, ”They broke their word. In my opinion, they should never be allowed to run for public office again because what they did is disgraceful.” Trump didn’t mention any Republican candidates by name. But some of his significant primary challengers, including Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Ohio Gov. John Kasich    who on Wednesday released a letter on his campaign fundraising list highlighting a positive poll for him    have yet to endorse Trump despite saying during the primary they would back the GOP nominee. Trump called Republicans who wouldn’t back the pledge ”sore losers.” Trump has struggled to unite Republican officials behind his campaign since clinching the party’s nomination in early May and his frustrations with the slow pace of that unity have boiled over in recent weeks. Despite talking up the need for party unity, Trump earlier this month criticized fellow Republicans and threatened to go it alone and campaign into the general election ”by myself.” Trump laid out his situation in stark terms on Thursday. ”It’s almost    in some ways, like, I’m running against two parties,” Trump told conservative talk radio host Mike Gallagher. ’The very best candidate’ Kasich has been using his campaign email list to fundraise for   Republicans such as Sen. John McCain along with candidates for House seats after the Ohio governor dropped out of the presidential race in May. But his letter on Wednesday, entitled ”The Latest” and authored by senior adviser John Weaver, highlighted the recent findings of a Ballotpedia poll that look bad for Trump. Weaver argued that the poll results ”confirm what we said throughout the campaign: John Kasich was the very best candidate to defeat Hillary Clinton.” ”Under a modeled electorate, Trump loses every swing state by   points. Governor Kasich wins 6 out of 7 swing states. Speaker Ryan wins 2 out of 7 swing states,” the email reads.  The email makes no mention of efforts to stop Trump from claiming the nomination but points to Kasich’s importance as a popular Republican leader.  ”This data is further proof that Governor Kasich is the most popular Republican politician in the nation today and it underlines why his efforts to help our U. S. Senate and House candidates are so very important,” the email concludes, with a link to the full poll results.  Kasich on Trump endorsement: ’Why would I?’ When asked by CNN why the campaign sent out the email, Chris Schrimpf, a Kasich spokesman, echoed the letter, saying the poll shows how important Kasich’s role is in the GOP. ”It shows how important Kasich is to keeping control of the House and Senate and to winning down ballot races across the country,” Schrimpf said. ”It further shows the party that a conservative message focused on bringing people together is the right direction for the future of the party.” Delegates will vote at the Republican convention in Cleveland next month to make Trump the official Republican presidential nominee. Although the convention is taking place in his home state, Kasich hasn’t announced yet whether he will attend. ”It would not be accurate at this point to say the governor won’t be at the official convention. That simply hasn’t been decided yet,” Schrimpf said Wednesday."
Turkey airport attack witness: ’It was like hell’ ,CNN,Madison Park,2016-06-29," (CNN) Terrified travelers tucked into alcoves and hid behind pillars. As the attackers fired shots and detonated explosives at the Istanbul Ataturk Airport on Tuesday, people scattered to get away from the chaotic scene.  ”There’s been a bomb!” travelers warned each other.  ”Someone’s coming with a gun.” Three terrorists armed with bombs and guns killed dozens of people at the busy airport in Turkey. Of the three bombers in the attack, two were at the international terminal, and the third terrorist was in the nearby parking lot, a Turkish official told CNN. All three detonated suicide vests. There was little time to make sense of what was unfolding for the many passengers and staff at the airport.   Coverage from CNN Turk,  ’Panic everywhere’ ”It was like hell,” said Mine Iyidinc, a witness. ”There was panic everywhere. We did not understand that it was a terrorist attack.” At the airport, Will Carter had been in the baggage area when he felt a shake, which he described as a ”dull thud” from two loud explosions. Carter sensed something was off because a shock wave seemed to reverberate throughout the airport.  ”It was loud enough to know something was not right,” he told CNN’s Anderson Cooper.   About a minute later, he felt the third explosion. This time, he saw ”a flash of a fire ball” inside the terminal. Panic and screams engulfed the room as Carter and other passengers fled. The aftermath, Just minutes before one of the bombs would explode, airport employee Levent Karaoglan said he passed the area where it would detonate. He was inside a plane when he heard the explosion.  ”I was heavily shaken by the explosion even though I was inside the plane,” Karaoglan said. ”When I got back inside the airport, everywhere was covered with smoke, all of the windows were shattered and people were fluttering around.” He started frantically looking for his colleagues. The explosion, he said, was near the counter where he usually works.  ”My colleagues who work at the ticket sale desk, they were on the ground and crying,” he said. ”A couple of my friends are wounded, hit on the head by different objects.” The scene haunted him: ”There are many casualties, legs, arms and everything, everywhere.” Survivors walked through the damaged airport, their steps crunching the shattered glass and crumbled pieces of the collapsed ceiling. Blood pooled on the floor and the air reeked of stuffy, hot smoke.  ”It looked like a disaster movie,” said one witness, Laurence Cameron.  Richard Kalnins had just landed at the airport and was on his way to passport control when people started rushing towards him screaming ”’bomb’ and screaming ’gunfire,’ and everyone just turned around and started running,” he said.  They ended up trapped in a   corridor.  ”Panic just set in,” he said. ”Kind of a frightening scenario, not knowing what’s going on,  being stuck in a corridor thinking that perhaps around the corner is someone running around with an assault rifle.”  Three hours later, they were able to leave.  Outside the airport, desperate family members and friends waited for news of their loved ones and strained to see if they could spot familiar faces in the crowd of dazed and shocked survivors. They held pieces of papers with names of their loved ones, waiting for news.  The police officers’ uniforms were soaked in blood, said traveler Fatos Karahasan, who had been inside a plane that had just arrived in Istanbul as the terrorist attacks unfolded.  Once Karahasan and his fellow passengers were led out of the plane, they walked through the scene in complete silence as ambulance sirens blared in the background. ”There was a silence of death covering the airport all around,” Karahasan said. ”It was heartbreaking. It is a terrifying thing to see the cultural capital of a country in such state, under such conditions.”  Hiding out amidst chaos, Thomas Kemper was in the Turkish Airlines lounge when the bomb blasts went off. ”Everybody started running and went in all directions,” he said. He ended up in a back room off the kitchen, where he hid behind some boxes with another man.  ”You have all these images of the terrorist coming and trying to kill you,” he said. ”You have these stories with Orlando and Paris and you think now they’re coming for you.”  After about 30 to 40 minutes, security personnel ushered everyone out.   Kemper, the general secretary for the Board of Global Ministries of the United Methodist Church, said most of the people with him in the lounge were Muslim.  ”This is a moment that should deepen our solidarity with all people who suffer from violence and terror,” he said. ”I felt this common humanity among us, whatever our faiths, that we need to reach out and take our hands and change this.”"
What you need to know about the Turkey attack,CNN,,2016-06-29," (CNN) It’s happened again: another terror attack. The scene this time: Turkey’s Istanbul Ataturk Airport, one of the busiest airports in Europe. At least 42 people died and 239 were injured when three attackers armed with firearms and explosives arrived at the airport in a taxi Tuesday night, then opened fire before blowing themselves up, according to Turkish authorities. Here’s what you need to know about this developing story: How the attack unfolded: The attackers opened fire with guns before detonating their bombs as security personnel tried to stop the assault. Two detonated their bombs at the airport’s international terminal building, a third was killed in the nearby parking lot, a Turkish official told CNN. One video from the attack shows a man, apparently an attacker, running with a gun. He falls after apparently being shot by a security officer, who briefly stands over the man before running away. About 10 seconds later, an explosion goes off. What witnesses saw: ”It was like hell,” said Mine Iyidinc. ”There was panic everywhere. We did not understand that it was a terrorist attack.” Witnesses reported feeling shock waves from the blasts and seeing broken glass everywhere. Another video from inside the airport shows some people slipping on the floor, which was covered in blood in some places. How did the attackers pull it off? While the airport has plentiful security    with checkpoints before entering the terminal building and again after passport control    the attackers may have exploited relatively light security at the entrance to the arrivals hall, analysts say. Police have interviewed and released the taxi driver who drove the trio of attackers to the airport, according to the Anadolu news agency. Who were the victims? Turkish authorities say 37 of the victims have been identified. At least 13 are foreigners, the government said. Among them: Two Iraqis, a Tunisian, a Chinese citizen, a Ukrainian, a Jordanian and a citizen of Uzbekistan, a Turkish official told CNN. Saudi Arabia said six of its citizens had died and five were still unaccounted for. The Palestian Authority’s Foreign Ministry said a Palestinian was among the dead. Three of the foreigners have dual Turkish citizenship, the official said. Of the 239 injured, 128 people were still being treated in hospitals. Families of 19 people killed in the attack have already received the remains of their loved ones. One of the victims who was killed was airport worker, Ozgul Ide, whose death was announced by her alma mater, Istanbul Arel University. There’s no claim of responsibility yet. But there’s also no shortage of suspects. Topping the list: ISIS, which has threatened Turkey over its involvement in the effort to eviscerate the terror group. Also possible: the PKK, a Kurdish separatist group labeled a terrorist organization by Turkey, the United States and others. Turkish officials seem to be leaning toward ISIS, with a senior Turkish government source telling CNN that while the bombers have not yet been identified, there’s a ”strong suggestion they are foreign.” Analysts also say the style of the attack and the target point more toward ISIS. Ataturk is already up and running again: The airport, the 11th busiest in the world, was closed for several hours overnight. Flights were diverted to Ankara, Turkey, and other cities. But it reopened at 2:20 a. m. Wednesday. Flights have resumed, although Iran canceled all scheduled flights between Tehran and Istanbul, Iran’s   Tasnim News Agency reported. Some forensic experts believe the airport may have contaminated evidence by reopening too soon. It will be an official day of mourning in Turkey. The government declared the observation and said flags will be flown at   in honor of the dead. World reaction is pouring in. President Barack Obama spoke with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Wednesday, offering his condolences and U. S. support. U. K. Prime Minister David Cameron called Erdogan to say the UK stands with Turkey ”as one in our defiance against these barbaric acts.” Russian President Vladimir Putin    who’s ordered a rapprochement with Turkey    also offered his condolences and said the attack ”confirms the need for a joint fight against terrorism.” Pope Francis prayed for the victims and U. N.   Ban   said more efforts are needed to combat terror. And all around the world, buildings were lit up in the colors of the Turkish flag    red and white. Erdogan’s strong words: The President said the terror attack on travelers and workers at Istanbul’s airport ”will not divide or split our country.” Erdogan said, ”We will be among the top 10 business countries in the world. This is why they want to divide us, because they cannot take our growing power.” He promised the government will ”not let down our people” and said the attackers didn’t act in an Islamic way. ”Taking one person’s life means going straight to hell,” he said. This is just the latest in a string of terror attacks in Turkey this year. Terrorists have struck Turkey seven other times in 2016, hitting tourist sites and police targets with deadly effect. So far, at least 140 people have died in such attacks. The attack could push Turkey deeper into the fight against ISIS. ”I would expect that Turkey’s vengeance will come down like rain from hell,” Soner Cagaptay of the Turkish Research Program at the Washington Institute told CNN. ”For Turkey now, fighting the   Islamic State is going to be priority number one.”"
Complaint filed about Donald Trump fundraising emails,CNN,Tal Kopan,2016-06-29,"Washington (CNN) Government watchdog groups have a filed a complaint alleging that the Donald Trump campaign broke federal election laws when a fundraising solicitation went to several foreign email addresses. Two groups, Campaign Legal Center and Democracy 21, who work to combat the influence of big money in politics, announced they would be filing the complaint with the Federal Election Commission on Wednesday. In the filing, the groups argue that a fundraising email from Trump’s campaign this month went to ”dozens” of politicians from Iceland, Scotland, Australia and Britain, as noted by media and tweets, with email addresses ending in foreign domains including ”. uk” and ”. is.” Road to 270: The 2016 Electoral Map, Campaign donations from foreign nationals are prohibited by federal election law, and the groups claim that Trump emailing obviously foreign addresses also is a violation.  ”Donald Trump should have known better,” Paul S. Ryan, CLC deputy executive director, said in a statement. ”It is a   that it violates the law to send fundraising emails to members of a foreign government on their official foreign government email accounts, and yet, that’s exactly what Trump has done repeatedly.” The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment on the complaint. FEC spokesman Christian Hilland said the commission cannot comment on candidates or hypothetical enforcement matters, adding that federal law prohibits the release of information on complaints before the commission. RELATED: Trump slams globalization in economic speech, Federal law prohibits donations from foreign nationals to campaigns. ”It is also unlawful to help foreign nationals violate that ban or to solicit, receive or accept contributions or donations from them,” says FEC guidance. But former FEC Chairman and counsel to the Republican National Committee Michael Toner, a CNN delegate analyst, said that while the law prohibits soliciting donations from foreigners, there is also a ”safe harbor” for campaigns.   ”The key is for the campaign to not knowingly solicit contributions from foreign nationals and to exercise due diligence in reviewing solicitation lists and examining contributions when they are received to confirm that they are lawful,” Toner told CNN. One way campaigns can demonstrate due diligence is by getting a copy of a donor’s passport photo if the donation comes from foreign bank accounts.   ”All this being said, if a campaign inadvertently solicits contributions from a few foreign nationals and refunds any foreign national contributions that are brought to its attention, I don’t believe the FEC would take any adverse action against the campaign,” Toner said.

Buildings light up in tribute to Istanbul ,CNN,,2016-06-29," (CNN) As night fell across parts of the world Wednesday, cities lit up in tribute to the victims of Tuesday’s Istanbul airport attack.  Public buildings in Australia and New Zealand were illuminated in the colors of the Turkish flag in memory of the victims.  In Melbourne, several public buildings glowed red and white, including the Victoria state parliament.  Daniel Andrews, the Premier of Victoria, tweeted, ”Honoring those who died, sending love to those who grieve. Turkey: Victoria stands with you. #Istanbul.”  The Arts Centre of Melbourne also posted on its Facebook page, ”This evening, our Spire will be illuminated red and white, the colors of the Turkish flag, in honour of those killed and injured in the Ataturk Airport terrorist attacks in Istanbul. Our values and way of life will always prevail. Violence and terrorism will not.”  In New Zealand, the Sky Tower in Auckland was also illuminated in tribute to Turkey.  The tributes mirror recent memorials to other tragedies. Many buildings, including New York’s One World Trade Center, were lit in the color of the Belgian flag after the terrorist attacks in Brussels in March. After the June 12 attack on a gay nightclub in Orlando, many buildings displayed the colors of the rainbow flag. "
Huma Abedin details Clinton email troubles in deposition,CNN,Tom LoBianco,2016-06-29,"Washington (CNN) Hillary Clinton’s personal email   caused extensive troubles inside the State Department, including her own messages to top staffers getting lost in spam filters, according to a new deposition of top aide Huma Abedin.  ”We should talk about putting you on State   or releasing your   address to the department so you are not going to spam,” Abedin wrote in a Nov. 13, 2010 email to Clinton that was discussed in a deposition Tuesday with Judicial Watch.  Abedin, who has become ensnared in ongoing Clinton email probes, explained in the deposition    a transcript of which was released Wednesday afternoon    that Clinton had missed an important call with a foreign minister because emails from her personal account were being filtered out.  ”Her initial   was about a phone call with a . .. foreign minister, which she missed and missed the call because she never got the    I never got her   suggests    giving us the signoff to do it. So she wasn’t able to do her job, do what she needed to do,” Abedin said. ”Just reading the exchange, she seems frustrated because she’s not able to do her job.” The deposition, released as part of an ongoing lawsuit from the conservative watchdog group, also includes talk of other internal communication breakdowns spurred by Clinton’s use of a personal email server to send emails while she was secretary of state.  But Abedin, long one of Clinton’s closest confidants, defended repeatedly against arguments the former secretary of state had done anything wrong.  ”Let’s get separate address or device but I don’t want any risk of the personal being accessible,” Clinton wrote in reply to Abedin’s Nov. 13, 2010 suggestion that she use a government email account. Abedin was peppered with questions about Clinton’s, but she repeatedly said it was Clinton protecting her personal emails from being read    and not about hiding government communications.  ”Just like you wouldn’t    I would imagine anybody who has personal   doesn’t want that personal   to be read by anybody else. .. I read it the same way as she has written it,” Abedin said.  A State Department spokeswoman declined comment on the problems raised in the deposition, citing ongoing litigation.  Throughout her deposition, Abedin defended Clinton’s decisions, describing them as normal and not suspect at all. ”She had requested a secure BlackBerry, but that did not come to fruition,” Abedin said, noting that her use of a personal BlackBerry was not surprising. ”I experienced it as continuing the practice that she had had prior to arriving at the State Department, and continuing to use her personal device.”"
Is Lena Dunham right about Kanye West’s ’Famous’?,CNN,Peggy Drexler,2016-06-29," (CNN) On Friday night in Los Angeles, Kanye West released the video to his latest single, ”Famous.” In it, the waxy likenesses of such celebrities as Anna Wintour and Donald Trump, Rihanna and her ex, Chris Brown, Caitlyn Jenner and Bill Cosby lay in apparent   states in the folds of a giant bed.  West is positioned squarely in the middle of the group, with wife Kim Kardashian and her naked derriere on one side and a likeness of Taylor Swift, breasts and pubic area exposed, on the other.  West says each member of the cast of characters was chosen for having had some impact or influence on his own path to fame. The video’s credits gave ”special thanks” to every celebrity involved ”for being famous.” In an interview with Vanity Fair, the singer said the song, and the video, is simply ”a comment on fame in America.” Vanity Fair dubbed it ” ”   it was called ”voyeuristic” and ”a feat of magic.”  In the words of actress and writer Lena Dunham, however, it’s ”sickening.” In a Facebook post Monday night, the ”Girls”   called the ”Famous” video ”one of the more disturbing ’artistic’ efforts in recent memory,” a dangerous reinforcement of rape culture and  . ”The prone, unconscious, waxy bodies of famous women, twisted like they’ve been drugged and chucked aside at a rager. ..,” she writes. ”It gives me such a sickening sense of  .”  The video, she writes, is ”informed and inspired by the aspects of our culture that make women feel unsafe even in their own beds, in their own bodies,” made her feel ”sad and unsafe and worried.”   Dunham, the daughter of artists, is no stranger to using shocking images, or hypersexual visuals for the sake of art, or to make a point (and, while she’s at it, to generate press, and ratings). And indeed she acknowledges that ”art’s job is to make us think in ways that aren’t always tidy or comfortable.”  But is this art? And if so, what’s the takeaway —  what are we meant to think?   Join us on Facebook. . Even West himself has said the video is ”not   or  ” anyone who appears in it. It’s not even for or against fame itself. It’s just a comment, he insists.  And so without the thoughtfulness or direction that most artists put behind such provocative works or statements, it’s plainly irresponsible. Is depicting controversial figures like Chris Brown, who had a violent relationship with ex Rihanna, beside her in West’s bed, and Bill Cosby, the subject of multiple   allegations over many years, an endorsement of their actions? Or something else?  We don’t know. But we are repelled. Perhaps West is taking aim at the falsehood and overexposure of celebrity, but the way he’s doing it —  by bullying, essentially, by barreling through —  negates any point he may be trying to make. Meanwhile, it’s of course notable and ironic that West and his wife, perhaps among the few who gave their consent to be part of this work and the most overexposed in real life, are among the least exposed in the video.  Dunham also makes the point that what most audiences will see, especially the younger and more impressionable ones —  the ones who are assaulted and raped and in daunting numbers  —   is less nuanced than whatever message West may be trying to send. All they’ll see, she writes, is the ”the stuff of snuff films.” And she’s right. Provocative art always sparks a discussion. But it’s hard to believe that West stripped bare some of pop culture’s most notable and  respected people —  an   among them —  for the ”Famous” video because he wanted to make an honest statement. He did it because he can, or because he thinks he can. And it’s that entitlement that has led to the culture we have today: where rape is   police officers whose actions lead to death are acquitted, politicians whose campaigns carry racist undertones can succeed not in spite of, but because of, them. He did this for the attention he’s now getting. Notably, few of the celebrities depicted in the video have issued a response. Perhaps they know that the less we talk about it, the less impact it has —  that the less attention we give to the bully, the smaller his power. It’s knowledge worth remembering. "

Poll: Clinton and Trump run neck-and-neck,CNN,Eric Bradner,2016-06-29,"Washington (CNN) A new Quinnipiac University poll shows Hillary Clinton leading Trump by just two points, 42% to 40% a much closer race than other recent surveys have shown.  With   candidates included, Clinton leads 39% to 37% with Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson at 8% and Green Party candidate Jill Stein at 4%.  This Quinnipiac poll is quite different from other recent surveys on the presidential race, showing a much tighter contest than others. Its field period overlaps with those of the Washington   News and NBC News   Street Journal polls released Sunday, both of which found Clinton significantly ahead of Trump.  Nightcap: Trump takes on Clinton  —   and Big Business  —   on trade | Sign up, The difference is primarily in the polls’ estimate of Clinton’s standing in the race: All three found Trump within the margin of error of the other estimates (at 40% in the Quinnipiac poll, 39% in the Washington   News poll and 41% in NBC News   Street Journal poll, no statistically significant differences there). But each of the three polls pegged Clinton’s support as significantly different from the other two polls, with the low at 42% in the Quinnipiac poll, 46% in the NBC News   Street Journal poll and the high of 51% in Washington   News poll. CNN’s latest Poll of Polls, spanning surveys conducted June   has Clinton ahead, 47% to 40%.  Quinnipiac found an alarming statistic: 61% of those surveyed say the 2016 election has increased the level of hatred and prejudice in the United States    compared to just 34% who say it has had no impact.  Of that 61% 67% blame Trump and 16% blame Clinton.  The survey also found a majority of voters    58% for Trump, and 53% for Clinton    said each would not be a good president.  Clinton allies to hit Trump with $13 million in ad spending, ”It would be difficult to imagine a less flattering    reaction to Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton,” said Tim Malloy, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University poll, in a memo accompanying the poll results. ”This is where we are. Voters find themselves in the middle of a     campaign between two candidates they don’t like. And they don’t think either candidate would be a good president.” The poll found a similar gender divide as previous surveys: Clinton wins among women, 50% to 33% while Trump has the advantage with men, 47% to 34%.    He is also ahead by the same margin with white voters, while Clinton wins   voters, 91% to 1% and Hispanic voters, 50% to 33%.

Front man Farage deserted by Brexit bandmates?,CNN,,2016-06-29," (CNN) It’s been a week since the British public went to the polls and set in motion one of the most traumatic periods in the country’s recent history. By Friday lunchtime in London, Prime Minister David Cameron had announced his intention to step down after the majority of voters opted to end British membership of the European Union. More galling for the   Cameron was the fact that many of the most prominent ”Brexiteers” had come from his own ruling Conservative Party, chief among them the former Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, and Justice Minister, Michael Gove. Where things stand 5 days on, Johnson, widely tipped to replace Cameron, even thanked the British people for ”doing our job for us” at the ballot box. ”It’s about the right of the people of this country to settle their own destiny,” he proclaimed at a press conference in the wake of the final results. ”They have decided that it is time to vote to take back control.” But by the following Thursday, Johnson had ducked out of the race to be the next Prime Minister of the UK. Having outlined the demands of the role to a room full of journalists in London, Johnson announced: ”I have concluded that that person cannot be me.” Gove had campaigned closely with Johnson for a Brexit, but said he had decided to run himself after concluding that Johnson ”cannot provide the leadership or build the team for the task ahead.” He told reporters on Friday that Britain is ”embarking on a new chapter and one that is in line with our best traditions,” adding that it can now ”build a new, stronger and more positive relationship with our European neighbors based on free trade and friendly  .” But how that will happen remains to be seen.  Vanishing act, As the financial markets reeled over the prospect of a Brexit and EU leaders led by Germany’s Angela Merkel warned Britain could not pick and choose what it wanted from EU membership, the ”Leave” campaign’s victorious leaders vanished quicker than they’d materialized    as if the result had been such a surprise to them that they’d overlooked the need to actually have a plan. The only person left on stage to bang the Brexit drum was the perennially   Nigel Farage. Much derided as a xenophobic and controversial figure in British politics, the leader of the UK Independence Party (UKIP) appeared to have the biggest smile of all. Asked how he would explain to Americans why Britain voted the way it did, Farage asked: ”Imagine if you had free movement of people from Mexico? How would you feel? You wouldn’t like it. Brexit: Romanians start    campaign, ”What we’re doing in the UK . .. we’re   our democratic rights. And in terms of business and trade, we’ll go on trading,” he said during an interview with CNN Tuesday.  Happy to stick with the American theme, Farage even praised Presidential nominee Donald Trump    who also backed the leave vote    because he ”dares to talk about the things that other people want to sweep under the carpet. ”But what Mr. Trump is doing in America is very different from what I’m trying to do. My problem in British politics is far greater than Donald Trump’s. We, literally, have lost our sovereignty, lost our borders, lost our ability to regulate.” Parliamentary punchlines, Farage seems happy to take the limelight in the absence of his fellow Brexiteers in the Conservative Party    even if that means taking the battle directly to his EU foes alone. In an extraordinary performance in the European parliament in Brussels on Tuesday, Farage took aim at his European colleagues during an emergency session called to debate Brexit. Amid jeering from across the chamber, Farage declared, ”you’re not laughing now!” Why this British town backed Brexit, ”Isn’t it funny? When I came here 17 years ago and I said that I wanted to lead a campaign go get Britain out of the European Union, you all laughed at me.” After more heckling from EU lawmakers, Farage, now in his element and with a British flag dangling nearby, questioned whether any of them had ever worked outside of politics. ”I know that virtually none of you have never done a proper job in your lives, or worked in business, or worked in trade, or indeed ever created a job. But listen, just listen.” This   appears to be the one laughing now, but it will quickly ring hollow if the millions of people in Britain that backed his cause feel  .

"NBA, Michael Jordan join talks over gender bathroom bill",CNN,Emanuella Grinberg,2016-06-29," (CNN) It’s no secret that business leaders, entertainers and heads of major corporations think North Carolina’s gender bathroom bill is not just discriminatory, but bad for the state’s economy. Now, the National Basketball Association is working with lawmakers to modify the controversial HB2 law, with sports legend Michael Jordan playing a key role. A source with knowledge of the negotiations told CNN Sports that the NBA, Jordan, owner of the Charlotte Hornets, and team president Fred Whitfield are involved in talks with legislators over the law, which requires people to use the bathroom that corresponds to their gender at birth and prevents local governments from passing   ordinances. The news comes amid reports that the North Carolina House leadership drafted new legislation modifying HB2 amid pressure from the NBA.  With Charlotte set to host the 2017   Game in February, the league’s interest in the outcome is clear. Community leaders in Charlotte have urged the NBA to keep the game in the state despite calls for the league to boycott. Earlier this month, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said he met with Charlotte business leaders working with government leaders behind the scenes ”to craft some sort of compromise.” He called the law’s bathroom provision a ”distraction” and said the   protections were the ”core issue.” ”I’d say there is absolutely strong interest in trying to work something out. I think both sides of the issue recognize, however heartfelt their views are, that the current state of being is causing enormous economic damage to the state.”  According to the source, if the game is played in Charlotte, the NBA wants everyone to be able to use the bathroom according to their gender identity, contrary to what the law mandates.  It’s not clear, though, that they’ll get their wish. A copy of the draft legislation appears to do little to address the bathroom issue or   protections. A copy obtained by CNN affiliate WBTV retains a provision of the bill that bans transgender people from accessing public restrooms in accordance with their gender identity. It also keeps a section that blocks localities from passing   protections. The most significant change is the creation of an official document that would recognize a person’s gender reassignment. The new document, which effectively would be the equivalent of a birth certificate, is referred to as a ”certificate of sex reassignment” in the draft legislation. The proposed language requires a ”notarized statement” from a physician who performed the surgery in order to request a certificate from the state registrar.  It also adds federal   workplace protections, but specifically states that the use of bathrooms according to biological sex ”shall not be deemed to constitute discrimination.”  Draft legislation a ’work in progress’ Rep. Charles Jeter ( ) told CNN that the draft legislation is legitimate and confirmed that the state House is considering changes to the law.  He disputed the suggestion that the NBA threatened to pull the   Game from Charlotte over the legislation.  ”It’s unfair and uncharacteristic to say that there was pressure from the NBA,” Jeter told CNN. ”We’ve had discussions with stakeholders, be it religious groups, businesses, or sports leagues, but there has been no mandate from the NBA or anybody else.” Jeter said North Carolina lawmakers are mindful of criticism of HB2 but insisted that the NBA did not pressure them to act.  ”We’d be naïve to say that [outside criticism] doesn’t have an impact,” Jeter tells CNN. ”We listen and we pay attention.”  Jeter said it is common for legislators to create paper versions of drafts, noting that more changes could still come.  ”This is a draft. It is by no means a final version of the bill and there are still discussions to be held,” Jeter said. ”It’s a process and a work in progress.” He said a final amended version of HB2 was ”close” to being released within the next few days. It’s also not clear how the draft or any other proposed changes would effect a pending lawsuit from the federal government over the law. The Justice Department’s lawsuit seeks declaratory relief and threatens to curtail federal funding to the North Carolina Department of Public Safety and the University of North Carolina. Groups insist law be repealed, LGBT groups said the draft legislation is a far cry from what they want: a full repeal of the law.  ”This is nothing more than ’HB 2. 0,’” said Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin. ”Anyone who cares about equality must reject this ridiculous proposal out of hand. This despicable bill would continue insidious policies targeting LGBTQ people for discrimination and do nothing to fix the mess HB2 created. It’s past time for North Carolina lawmakers to listen to the overwhelming chorus of voices from across North Carolina and around the country calling for full repeal of this hateful law.” ”Legislative leadership must stop digging their own hole ever deeper. North Carolina can’t afford it,” said Equality NC Executive Director Chris Sgro, a member of the North Carolina General Assembly. ”This leaked draft is the result of another backroom deal that does nothing to fix the problems of HB2. We need to repeal HB2 immediately. The legislature cannot cut and run.”"
Police offer motive for Texas mom who killed daughters,CNN,Emanuella Grinberg,2016-06-29," (CNN) Christy Sheats called a family meeting with her husband and two daughters on Friday in the living room of their Fulshear, Texas home. Jason Sheats thought his wife was going to tell Taylor, 22, and Madison, 17, that their parents were getting a divorce. Instead, she pulled out a gun and fatally shot her daughters, Fort Bend County Sheriff Troy E. Nehls said in a news conference Wednesday. Minutes later a Fulshear police officer shot the mother outside the home when she refused to put down her weapon.  Christy Sheats had ”ample time and opportunity” to kill her husband ”but she chose not to,” Nehls said, sharing details of the incident for the first time. ”He felt Christy wanted him to suffer,” Nehls said, repeating what Jason Sheats told him. ”Mr. Sheats stated Christy knew how much he loved Taylor and Madison and how much they loved him,” Nehls continued.  ”By killing his children Mr. Sheats will have to live the rest of his life with this horrible memory.” The daughters were found on the street with gunshot wounds. Taylor died at the scene her younger sister Madison at a hospital. Jason Sheats told police his wife suffered from depression, Nehls said. She was taking ”numerous” prescription medications and seeing a therapist. She had been admitted to a private mental health facility three times in recent years for attempted suicide, Nehls said. Police hunt for    suspect in family feud killing, Jason Sheats told police that his wife of more than 20 years began a ”downward spiral” after the 2012 death of her beloved grandfather, from whom she received the gun, Nehls said. Her mother died two months later, worsening her condition. Days before the shootings Christy Sheats had a fight with her oldest daughter in which she tried to ground Taylor and forbid her from seeing her fiancee, Jason Sheats told police. The father disagreed with his wife that grounding was an appropriate punishment for a    Nehls said. Christy Sheats shot her daughters inside the home, starting with Taylor, Nehls said. Taylor sustained a single gunshot through the back. Madison was shot through the neck.  Wife allegedly paid man to beat husband to death over real estate, After they were were shot Jason Sheats managed to run behind the couch and get them outside, Nehls said. Both daughters collapsed in the street. By then, the sheriff’s office had responded to a 911 call and confronted Christy Sheats outside the home. When she advanced at them with the gun, refusing commands put it down, an officer fatally shot her. Jason Sheats did not appear at Wedndesay’s news conference but gave the sheriff’s office permission to share his account, Nehls said. ”We look at him as a victim,” Nehls said. ”This is something he is going to have to live with for the rest of his life. ”She accomplished what she set out to do, which is to make him suffer.”"
"A Catholic reads the Bible, Week 40",CNN,,2016-06-29," (CNN) It’s been an overwhelming week. I am again having a hard time focusing. The pages of Matthew are half text and half footnotes. The words of Jesus are in red. Every statement has a double or triple meaning. Each footnote contains more information than is needed to write a Ph. D. thesis. It’s distracting. In order to write this week, I am trying to translate the notes.  Nah. I am just going to focus on the Word. I concede that it is important for me to know what Jesus really intended when he stated proclamations like this, ”Again, I say to you, it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for one who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.” (Matthew 19:24).  All these years, I really thought they were talking about a sewing needle. But Jesus probably had in mind a small gate. That’s good information. But then the footnote cautions that that meaning shouldn’t ”mitigate” the importance of what is being said. OK, I get the gist of the metaphor. But there’s a big difference between a gate and a needle. So, maybe some translators should clear that up?  Now that I have vented that out like a petulant child, I read a story that really got me thinking. After the tumultuous visit to the Temple in Jerusalem, Jesus proclaims, ”My house shall be a house of prayer, but you are making it a den of thieves.” He’s a little angry, seeing commerce and not prayer in the Temple. Or maybe he’s hangry.  Jesus goes looking for fruit on a tree. He gets mad at a fig tree that has no fruit and says, ”May no fruit ever come from you again,” and the tree withers. (I later learned this passage is the source of the satirical signs   brandished at   rallies, ”God hates figs. ”)  Like me, the disciples were amazed. They were fearful. I am still amazed because I always think of Jesus as not spiteful to trees. This is not the Jesus that I am as familiar with from my Sunday worship. It’s interesting that this story hasn’t made it into the weekly Gospel readings at Mass. When the disciples proclaim their version of amazement, Jesus explains faith in a way that I hadn’t thought about before:  ”Amen, I say to you, if you have faith and do not waver, not only will you do what has been done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, ’be lifted up and thrown into the sea,’ it will be done. Whatever you ask for in prayer with faith, you will receive.”  I have asked for things in life while praying and it hasn’t happened. What does this mean? I realized in that moment that I have occasionally treated my prayers like making a wish on a genie in a bottle. For example, I can’t count the number of times I prayed to God that my father would be cured of his cancer. While I didn’t bargain or offered any sort of sacrifice, I just begged. That wasn’t faith.  It’s through this project that I have really had the chance to look at my faith and how I talk to God differently.  If my Dad were going through his illness now, I would like to think that my prayers would not be different. Since his death, I have also asked for acceptance of the loss and the strength to be like him. Those are the parts of my faith that I have felt like it has grown. And one last thing: I will never look at a fig the same way again."
Here’s the deal with Elizabeth Warren’s Native American heritage,CNN,Gregory Krieg,2016-06-29," (CNN) From ”Lyin’ Ted” Cruz and ”Lil’ Marco” Rubio to ”Crooked Hillary” Clinton, Donald Trump has consistently conjured up demeaning nicknames for his campaign foes.  Which brings us to Elizabeth Warren. The Massachusetts senator has been a biting critic of the presumptive Republican nominee for some time and, more recently, one of Clinton’s most vocal and, at least with Democrats, popular attack dogs.  Trump has responded by repeatedly trying to belittle her as ”Pocahontas.” Elizabeth Warren: Donald Trump would ”Crush you into the ground” But why    and why is Trump surrogate Scott Brown, the former GOP senator Warren unseated in 2012, suggesting Warren take a DNA test to prove she’s part Native American? Let’s slow it down, and take a look at what we know about Warren’s heritage: Is Warren part Native American? Warren says, yes, she is, and points to ”family stories” passed down to her through generations as evidence.   ”I am very proud of my heritage,” Warren told NPR in 2012. ”These are my family stories. This is what my brothers and I were told by my mom and my dad, my mammaw and my pappaw. This is our lives. And I’m very proud of it.” In that account and others, a genealogist traced Warren’s Native American heritage to the late 19th century, which, if true, would make her   Native American. (However, the legitimacy of those findings has been debated.) The Washington Post’s ”Fact Checker” page has actually decided against judging the issue at all, offering ”no rating” and, in a piece Tuesday, suggesting ”readers to look into it on their own and decide whether Trump’s attacks over Warren’s background have merit.” Did it play a role in her career? Harvard Law School in the 1990s touted Warren, then a professor in Cambridge, as being ”Native American.” They singled her out, Warren later acknowledged, because she had listed herself as a minority in an Association of American Law Schools directory. Critics note that she had not done that in her student applications and during her time as a teacher at the University of Texas. Warren maintains she never furthered her career by using her heritage to gain advantage.  Trump: Elizabeth Warren is ”very racist” How did this become a political issue? It began during Warren’s 2012 Senate run, when her opponent, Brown, accused her of lying to get a leg up in her academic career.  ”Professor Warren claimed that she was a Native American, a person of color,” he said during a debate. ”And as you can see, she’s not.” Warren shot back that she had not gained any ”advantage”    a claim that has proven impossible to fact check    and in a subsequent ad again cited family lore. Nightcap: The latest news and political buzz from CNN Politics | Sign up, ”As a kid, I never asked my mom for documentation when she talked about our Native American heritage. What kid would? But I knew my father’s family didn’t like that she was part Cherokee and part Delaware, so my parents had to elope,” she said. Their quarrel took a nasty turn around this time, when Brown’s staffers were filmed doing ”war whoops” and ”tomahawk chops” during an outdoor rally.  Brown told WCVB in Boston that he didn’t condone their actions, but said ”the real offense is that (Warren) said she was white and then checked the box saying she is Native American, and then she changed her profile in the law directory once she made her tenure.” Warren’s earlier musings on the ”high cheekbones” of certain close family members didn’t exactly satisfy the skeptics (and made some allies wince). Brown, a surrogate for Trump, suggested Monday that Warren ”take a DNA test” to prove she’s part Native American. What’s been Trump’s line of attack? Mostly namecalling and trying to use Warren’s statements about her heritage to discredit her.  ”Let’s properly check goofy Elizabeth Warren’s records to see if she is Native American. I say she’s a fraud!” he had tweeted last month. Trump sharpened the point Monday, telling NBC News: ”She made up her heritage, which I think is racist. I think she’s a racist, actually because what she did was very racist.” Trump: Elizabeth Warren is ”as Native American as I am” ”I hope that she’s selected as the vice presidential running mate. I will speak very openly about her if she is,” he said. ”She is one of the least productive senators in the United States Senate. We call her ’Pocahontas’ for a reason.” Warren didn’t back down.  ”If you think recycling Scott Brown’s   attacks on my family is going to shut me up, @realDonaldTrump, think again buddy. Weak,” she replied. And who was Pocahontas anyway? Pocahontas, the daughter of a Native American chief, welcomed English settlers to the   U. S. in the early 17th century. Legend holds that she saved the life of Captain John Smith, stopping his execution by laying her head upon his.  Years later, though, she was kidnapped by another group of English and in 1614 converted to Christianity while in captivity before marrying a tobacco farmer and taking the name ”Rebecca.”"
Why we forget Muslim terror victims,CNN,,2016-06-29," (CNN) I was just in Istanbul on Monday morning, flying back from four days in Sarajevo. I’ll be there again next Friday, passing through once more. I’ve been a tourist in Istanbul and a tour guide, too. I’ve gone there for work and for pleasure, for family and for fun, as a destination and a connection. I think it might be the greatest city in the world, and I have high standards: I’m a New Yorker. So Tuesday’s attack on Ataturk International, which killed 41 and injured scores more, hit awfully close to home. But so did our response.  Once more, there’s far less outrage when the victims of terrorism are Muslim. I don’t see any world leaders flying to Istanbul to march in public protests against extremism, after all, even though there’s been more violence from terrorists in Turkey than many other countries.  Some Muslims think this double standard is a clear instance of Islamophobia. I’m not sure I agree. What’s happening here has more to do with what we know about Muslims, what we don’t know about Muslims and what we would prefer not to know about Muslims.  We love movies, especially disaster movies. But look at who the disasters happen to. People pay money to see the places they care about go up in smoke. That might mean cities many people have been to, want to go to or are actually from.  Next to nobody wants to see Baghdad, so next to nobody wants to go see Baghdad destroyed on the screen. And even if they did, they might not know it’s Baghdad that’s being leveled    I always grimace, for example, when a city like Islamabad is portrayed as if it’s in a desert, not the impossibly green Punjabi plains. It’s like filming in Malaga and proclaiming it Manhattan.  We care more for places we know, and for people like us. We dismiss places we don’t. And that reflects how power works in the world.  As China has become a global superpower, we’ve seen Hollywood bend over backward to reach its audiences. The Netflix series ”Marco Polo” is a solid summary of the early 21st century: Westerner goes east. That way, both Western and Eastern audiences will want to watch, and you make more money.  But how many people can afford Netflix subscriptions, or movie tickets, or newspaper subscriptions, or can write letters to the editor, or complain to advertisers, in Muslim countries? Because, sadly, the Muslim world is much poorer than the West (and now the Far East, too).  Societies that have trouble meeting the basic needs of their citizens certainly can’t afford to make the world aware of their culture and values by investing in soft power, educational exchange or cultural diplomacy. They end up ignored, unknown, misunderstood and demonized. They are misrepresented in mainstream media, but they lack the resources to push back, to tell their stories, to challenge biases. Turkey is wealthier than many Muslim countries, but it’s still not as central to the global imagination as Paris, as Brussels, even Orlando. So even if Istanbul suffers the same kinds of violence that we do, it doesn’t generate the same kind of sympathy.  But that’s still not all that’s happening here.  We often talk about extremism as if it comes out of nowhere. As if it has no causes, and our foreign policies have no consequences. We’re actually genuinely surprised that wars against Iraq, created by Western colonizers, have ultimately helped incubate a global terrorist movement that has aspirations of imperial conquest. While there have been some outstanding analysts and experts, like Andrew Bacevich, Karen Greenberg and Mark Danner, who have pointed out the consequences of the war on terror, most of us prefer to proceed on autopilot. Because just like it’s easier to sympathize with people you understand, it’s harder to accept facts that force you to discuss your own complicity in another nation’s implosion. So we’re too often indifferent to Muslim victims of terrorism not only because to be otherwise would force us to rethink our assumptions about Islam (that it is a violent religion) but that it would force us to accept some measure of culpability in the events so traumatizing the world. It’s the mirror image of Muslims who deny ISIS has anything to do with Islam, or even go further and proclaim ISIS a Western conspiracy. Many of us prefer to think of ISIS as prosecuting a civilizational war against the West that the majority of ISIS’ victims are Muslims challenges the idea that ISIS authentically represents Islam, and that the West is the only    or even primary    victim of terrorism. If ISIS is a blatantly     movement, whose violence is mostly directed at Muslim communities, we’d have to reorient our entire approach to the Muslim world. Doing so might force us to consider Palestinians, or Iraqis, or Yemenis, as just as dignified and valuable as we are, which would mean we would have to question, very seriously, why we treat their countries in ways we would never accept being treated    in ways that, if we’re honest, we would respond to with violence. But while today it happens to be Muslims, in the past it might have been Jews, or Native Americans, or the Japanese. While we publicly debated the Iran deal, few pointed to the hypocrisy of the only country in the world to have ever used nuclear weapons against civilian targets lecturing the world about the dangers of nuclear weapons. And that’s why this goes beyond Islamophobia. One of the main reasons we pay little attention to Muslim victims of terror isn’t just that we know less about Islam, and have fewer ways to learn more. It’s also because we prefer not to look too closely at something that would make us look more closely at ourselves. After all, we might not like what we see.   Join us on Facebook. .

Why Belarusians are getting naked at work ,CNN,,2016-06-30," (CNN) Alexander Lukashenko    often called ”the last dictator in Europe”    certainly has   citizens. Belarusians are now stripping off in their offices after the president ordered them to ”get undressed and work.” Using the hashtag #раздеватьсяиработать    roughly translating to #GetUndressedAndGoToWork    people all over the country are sharing nudies on social media.  The president’s exclamation seems to have been a Freudian slip, as the phrase ”get undressed” (razden’sya) sounds similar to ”develop themselves” (razvivat’ sebya) in Russian. Lukashenko expressed his wish during a speech at the 5th Belarusian People’s Congress in Minsk. All in all, the speech addressed the importance of technology and innovation in order to lift Belarus from one of its worst economic situations in decades.  The nude flash mob has been picked up outside of Belarus as well, with more and more social media users undressing around the Baltic Sea."
We’re about to find out how close we are to China’s ’line in the sand’,Business Insider,Linette Lopez,2016-03-07,"”On Sunday night, we’ll get an update on one of the most important data points in global finance right now: China’s    balance.” ”As China’s volatility has become a driver of global markets, the country’s   reserves have become a topic of fierce debate. They’re either the country’s savior or a distraction lulling the world into a false sense of security.” ”On the savior side, some say China’s reserves are the glue that’s holding the country together.” ’Knowing that the country has $3 trillion in cash to deal with dramatically slowing growth, a falling currency, and necessary economic reforms helps people sleep better at night.’ ’On the other hand, some, like hedge fund billionaire Kyle Bass, say even $3 trillion is not enough to save the country in the event of a banking crisis that is almost certainly on its way. And disaster aside, star China analyst Charlene Chu says the country would need  into the economy to get it growing again.’ ”Regardless, the picture for February isn’t that great. And it’s not just a question of having a big cushion of cash in the bank. In January, Chu wrote that if levels hit a certain point, the government’s going to have to take action [emphasis ours]:” ’’ ”In a recent note, Barclays analysts wrote that we’re likely to see Chinese   reserves decline by about $70 billion in February [emphasis ours]:” ”China’s economy is transitioning from one based on investment to one based on consumption. As that happens, massive industries that used to drive growth  —   like industrial commodities  —   will become less important. Ideally, new ones  —   like the service industry  —   will pick up the slack.” ”But in the meantime, there’s pain. The old industries must be restructured, and workers will lose their jobs. In fact, we know that 1. 8 million people will be fired from China’s copper and steel industries. That’s going to cost the country $15 billion.” ”That’s only going to get worse too. Officials told Reuters that we may see 5 million to 6 million Chinese people lose their jobs over the next two to three years. ” ’In the face of all this, people are taking money out of the country at rates Goldman Sachs said ”” The result is a decline in the Chinese yuan. That would’’ve been welcomed in an   China, but officials now need a currency strong enough to give its people purchasing power on a global scale. That means,  the forex reserves are also doing the work of propping up the yuan.’ ”It matters outside of China too.

Faraday Future is still shrouded in mystery,Business Insider,Bryan Logan,2016-03-07,"’’ ’For all of the attention that the   startup Faraday Future has gotten in the past year, very little is still known about the company.’ ’When it first appeared in California last year, Faraday Future was quickly dubbed a potential   backed by Chinese internet billionaires keen to get into the   game.’ ’After months of speculation and the occasional teaser from Faraday, the startup showed off its  at the Consumer Electronics Show in January.’ ”With it came Faraday’s Variable Platform Architecture and modular battery packs  —   both of which are supposed to help Faraday produce multiple types of vehicles, large and small.” ’We also know that Faraday wants to be more than just an automaker, targeting multiple domains including tech, internet, and entertainment  —   all of which would be delivered to something with four wheels.’ ’But once Faraday Future announced a $1 billion deal to build an assembly plant in Nevada, the questions really started piling up.’ ”Here are two company names you need to know going forward: LeEco, and Leshi Internet Information and Technology. LeEco, formerly known as LeTV, is a Chinese media company and is partnered with Faraday Future. Leshi is a publicly traded corporation in China that includes several of LeEco’s business divisions.” ’The Faraday Future factory deal was announced in December, the same month that trading of Leshi shares was suspended on markets in China.’ ’The Leshi stock suspension worried state officials in Nevada, where policymakers had offered Faraday more than $215 million in tax breaks to get the factory built.’ ’Nevada state treasurer Dan Schwartz  that he asked Faraday Future for about $75 million as collateral for the project.’ ’”I’’m only responsible to the taxpayers of Nevada,” Schwartz said.’ ’Faraday Future executives  that the company would put up a $75 million performance bond for the project. Another $13 million would be paid by   to go toward construction.’ ”As it turns out, Nevada’s concerns about the link between Leshi’s suspended stock and the risk associated with the Faraday factory could be misplaced.” ’The trade suspension was part of the normal course of business in China, as Leshi undergoes some corporate restructuring. The resumption of trade in Leshi stock on the Shenzhen exchange, once expected to happen this week, has been pushed back to May 7, according to a statement from Leshi that was obtained by Business Insider.’ ”The delay is one of many since Leshi’s stock suspension began in December.” ’Despite this, the statement from Leshi says ”business momentum remains strong,” and it cites a ”90% revenue increase to $1. 99 billion in 2015 and a 59% increase in net income. ”’ ”A Faraday Future representative told Business Insider that the moves by   were unrelated to the business of Faraday because LeEco’s billionaire CEO, Jia Yueting, was backing Faraday with personal assets.” ’Business Insider obtained a letter Jia sent to Nevada lawmakers last week that read in part: ”While I am personally backing FF, there is also a diverse funding strategy to help us fully realize our mission and vision. ”’ ”The letter does not specify what that funding strategy is, or who Faraday’s other investors are.” ’Joe Paluska, an   industry expert, says this level of secrecy is unusual. ”Nearly every Silicon Valley startup I know goes out of its way from day one to announce the executive team, the product road map, the market opportunity, and the investor team,” Paluska told Business Insider.’ ’Paluska says if Leshi trading were suspended on the Nasdaq, it would be easier to obtain information from regulators and other sources. ”But because it’’s happening in China,” he said, ”it’’s causing heartburn, no doubt. ”’ ’”When a company like FF suddenly appears  —   with an unknown major (if not exclusive) investor  —   it inserts an additional measure of risk into the equation,” Paluska said.’ ’Nevada’’s officials seem less worried. Gov. Brian Sandoval  last week saying, ”The speed at which you are moving forward . .. is a clear sign of the seriousness of your investment in our state and this facility,” The Las Vegas   reported.’ ”Faraday Future’s representative told Business Insider that the carmaker was moving forward with development of its    production vehicle, which is undergoing   testing in the Midwest.

Microsoft is trying to bring back the ’80s with its Windows 10 strategy,Business Insider,Matt Weinberger,2016-03-07,"’’ ”Probably  came in 1980, when he decided not to hand over the copyright for Microsoft’s first operating system to IBM.” ’In 1980, IBM contracted a startup called Microsoft to deliver DOS, an operating system for its forthcoming IBM PC, on a tight deadline.’ ’The IBM PC came out in 1981 and soon became a smash hit, surpassing the leading Apple II.’ ’A horde of competitors rushed to build their own ”IBM Compatible” clones that could run all of the same software and use all of the same hardware upgrades.’ ’But to build those IBM clones, they needed DOS. And if they wanted DOS, they needed to fork over cash to Microsoft. Microsoft kept the rights in lieu of royalties from IBM.’ ’DOS put Microsoft the very center of the PC revolution, even through the era of Windows, and even after IBM left the PC market, eventually selling off that business.’ ”  years later, it’s been a long time since the IBM PC moment. And with the Apple iPhone and Google Android ruling the   mobile market, Microsoft missed its shot at the    revolution.” ”That’s why Microsoft, which keeps boasting about how much it loves selling cloud services and subscriptions, is suddenly investing so much in hardware like the HoloLens and the Surface. If no new IBM PC will come along like in 1981, Microsoft will just have to build it itself.” ”The iPhone and Android have a stranglehold on the mobile market. Apple has ridden the iPhone to become the  while Google’s Android is now the most powerful operating system in the world.” ’Microsoft missed that boat. And Microsoft, going forward, has to decide if it wants to  while it tries to force the next big thing to happen.’ ’Microsoft has decided to build the devices it wants to see in the world. And .’ ”The tone was set in 2012, when Microsoft launched the Surface, its first tablet. That was followed up by the Surface Pro   hybrid, and, eventually, the Surface Book, Microsoft’s first   laptop.” ’’ ’Looking to the future, the Microsoft HoloLens looks to be the first commercially available   headset, layering holograms on top of your field of vision.’ ”The important thing that Surface and HoloLens have in common is that they’re already sparking competitors to build their own clones.  while  and perhaps  are working on HoloLens clones.” ’And in all cases, those cloned devices are running the Microsoft Windows 10 operating system.’ ”So even if Microsoft isn’t selling the hardware, it’s increasing the reach of Windows 10 with every cloned device sold. HoloLens has the potential to set the standard for holographic computing, but it won’t necessarily be the most popular holographic computer.” ’Sound familiar?’ ’The problem is that building complex machinery is a   business, across all industries.’ ’Building a computer (or a hologram headset, or a car) is   requires a lot of specialized parts, and takes time to make each and every unit. ; .’ ”Meanwhile, one of Microsoft’s big advantages has always been that software is a much   business than hardware. In 1999, right at the height of its powers, .” ’Microsoft’’s smart move was to make profitable software and let companies like IBM, Dell, HP, and Compaq build their   ”IBM Compatible” PCs. After all, they all still needed buckets of pricey Windows licenses, no matter what they charged for their computers.’ ’’ ’Therefore, it seems unlikely that Microsoft really sees all of this business of making hardware as something truly critical to its future, compared with its   Windows and Office businesses.’ ’The Surface is popular, and even its Xbox One   console is on the upswing in sales, but Microsoft has clearly signaled that in all corners of its business, the future is in Windows 10 and cloud services.’ ”So while it’s unlikely that Microsoft will stop selling these devices any time soon  —   at least, so long as they keep making money  —   it’s equally obvious that Microsoft is mostly interested in using them to drive the future.” ”There’s plenty of competition, especially in the holographic world.  for instance, is a   startup with some  that has nothing to do with Microsoft or Windows 10.” ”But if Microsoft succeeds, it’ll be the center of a new revolution, and the eighties will truly be back.” ’Probably the smartest choice Bill Gates ever. ..’"

He later appeared headed to a loss in Idaho.’ ’Trump started off his speech by indicating his interest in boosting   candidates this November.’ ’”It’’s very, very important as a Republican that our senators and that our congressmen get reelected and that we get a good group of people together, that we keep the people that are there,” Trump said. ”We have some terrific people. Not all of them are on my side, but we have some terrific people. ”’ ’He then touted the turnout at the polls and his crossover appeal. This was a potential message to Washington Republicans, who have long worried that a Trump nomination could hurt their chances of holding on to the Senate.’ ’”We have Democrats coming over, we have independents coming over, and they haven’’t done that ever, probably ever,” Trump said. ”And with all these people coming over we’’re going to have something very, very special. ”’ ’’ ’Trump also assured people that he could beat Clinton in a general election.’ ’”If I get to go against Hillary, polls are showing that I beat her, and some of the polls have my beating her very easily,” Trump said. ”We will take many, many people away from the Democrats and we’’ll take many people away that normally go Democrat as independents. ”’ ’In a sharp pivot, Trump further sounded conciliatory toward Ryan.

Tesla isn’t disrupting anything,Business Insider,Matthew DeBord,2016-03-09,"’’ ’If there’’s one word that’’s routinely used when talking about Tesla, it’’s ”disruption. ”’ ’The message is that the advent of a relatively successful  —   if not yet profitable  —     car company means that the balance of power in transportation will decisively shift.’ ’So long,   cars. Hello, cars fueled by electrons!’ ”This is CEO Elon Musk’s overarching strategic goal with Tesla: not to sell a lot of electric cars and call it a day, but to sell a lot of electric cars to accelerate humanity’s transition from the   era.” ’”Tesla is disruptive” sounds great to say and is a common refrain among analysts who follow the automaker as a hybrid of a tech firm and an automaker.  on Tuesday, after enjoying a test drive in Tesla’’s new Model X SUV.’ ’”The presence of the product on the market disrupts the market,” she said, ”and fundamentally changes that market or changes human behavior. ”’ ”James has a $   target price for Tesla and a buy rating. The stock is down 16%    but in the past 30 days it’s rallied by almost 40% from lows in the $140 range.” ”Bloomberg’s Alix Steel quickly pointed out that even if Tesla achieves Musk’s ambitions, by 2020 it will be delivering 500, 000 vehicles annually, while General Motors in 2016 sold well over 3 million. But that didn’t tamp down the disruption discussion.” ”And there’s a problem with that  —   a big problem: Tesla isn’t disrupting anything.” ’To be sure, Tesla has been a catalyst for innovation, or more accurately, the hastening of innovation  —     technologies and    software updates, for example, or the replacement of a lot of vehicle controls with a massive touchscreen between the front seats. Tesla is setting the pace on these fronts, beyond what it had already achieved with battery designs.’ ”But the auto industry globally, and particularly in the US, isn’t really under any disruptive pressure. What compelling reasons are there to proactively deviate from business as usual? Gas is cheap, credit is abundant, and everybody wants to buy profitable trucks and SUVs again. A record was set for US sales last year, as 17. 5 million vehicles rolled off dealer lots. There are trouble spots  —   Latin America and Russia  —   and growth in China has slowed.” ’’ ’But the vast majority of vehicles sold in 2015, and for that matter the preceding 100 years, have been designed and built the   way. They might have more technology features than they did in 1940, but they still have four wheels and are fueled by pulling up to a gas pump for 10 minutes.’ ”If the US government weren’t insisting on higher   standards, then in the current sales environment it would be difficult to see anyone besides Tesla advancing the cause of electric cars. GM has made a splash with the Bolt EV, which will arrive later this year, but it’s an open question as to whether it will sell all that well, at least initially. Electric cars from Honda, Nissan, and others are gathering negligible market share compared with traditional vehicles.” ’Tesla has noted that its Model S sedan is outselling many luxury models. But there are several problems with seeing that as evidence that Tesla is shaking up the luxury market and displacing   cars. For starters, all Tesla can do is compare the Model S to similar sedans. But of course BMW and Mercedes and Audi all sell a far greater variety of vehicles.’ ”Additionally, people buy Teslas because they’re Teslas. Plenty of sophisticated and   consumers are preoccupied with Teslas because the vehicles are futuristic. But their buying patterns aren’t moving the needle even slightly in just the US market. Less than 0. 5% of all vehicles sold in 2015 carried a Tesla badge. That doesn’t make Tesla a niche brand  —   that makes it a   brand.” ”It also means that Tesla is having no meaningful impact on the auto market. The story is incredibly impressive  —   there hasn’t been a new American car company since Chrysler in 1925. And the vehicles are splendid. I’ve driven everything Tesla’s got, from the original Roadster to the Model X, and I’ve been uniformly impressed.” ”But as far as EVs go, Tesla has the space to itself  —   something that Musk isn’t necessarily happy about. Industry leaders are skeptical about taking the deeper EV plunge. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles CEO Sergio Marchionne, for one, doesn’t think electric cars make any sort of market sense.” ’’ ’’ ’’ ’’ ’’ ’’ ”If there’s one word that’s routinely used when. ..”"

Its share price dropped below its $9 initial public offering (IPO) price at one point, and although it’s recovered to trade at $11. 48 as of Tuesday afternoon, that’s still lower than the   closing price of $13. 07 a share.” ’Analysts expect $343. 2 million in revenue on a loss of $0. 13 per share for the quarter.

Why the Technology in ’Rogue One’ Is So Old-Fashioned,Atlantic,Bryan Alexander,2017-01-03,"We expect certain storytelling forms to pay special attention to setting. Historical fiction spends a great deal of energy in recreating the past. Fanfiction does something similar for its source material. Science fiction and fantasy fans expect  . Rogue One, a combination of all of these forms, does this very well on multiple levels.   It is, after all, science fiction, and the Star Wars universe has long had a strong fantasy vibe. Being a work by other creators in a beloved franchise built by others, the movie is very much like fanfiction.  And given the way the movie’s setting and plot slot into a specific timeline within the Star Wars universe, it’s pretty close to a work of historical fiction.  Accordingly, we get meticulous recreations of shots, dialogue, plot points, sound tracks, characters, spacecraft, various other technologies, and, famously or notoriously, two actors, one dead, the other aged nearly a   past her original performance. The technological aspect tugged at my mind.  The presentation of a galactic empire’s tech and infrastructure was staunchly retro, even reactionary. To explain: David Edelstein notes that the movie “rehashes the plots of about a thousand World War II   Western films in which a brave squadron —  a Magnificent Seven, a Dirty Dozen, a Force Five —  prepares to sacrifice itself in the name of a greater cause. ”  That’s because the technology looks and acts like it’s from WWII.  We see switches, cables, heavy doors, grenades, machine guns (“blasters”) a staff, and sniper rifles, but no radiation weapons or gamma ray bursters.  Stormtroopers drive a truck, rather than enjoying, say, a   trawler. Spaceships are there, but act entirely as fighter and bomber aircraft, or as naval warships.  We never worry about the vast distances between stars, time dilation, the enabling technology, artificial gravity, or really anything at all about space travel. Similarly, computers are basically typewriters and radio receivers.  The movie’s main plot point, the Death Star plans which activate the first movie’s action, are essentially physical, not digital.  They are stored as a physical object in a gigantic file system, then mostly passed from hand to hand. When they briefly act electronically, it’s as a radio transmission, often with specialized radio operators complete with giant headsets. There are very few mobile devices, and they don’t matter. There is a robot companion, yes,   but in the style of many robot depictions he is in practice a skilled human being.  In appearance he resembles something from early Soviet technology, hulking and either   or actively hostile. He’s dieselpunk, not  . Speaking of cyberpunk, in Rogue One there is no sign of the communications world after the internet. There aren’t any networks. Nobody hacks anything or checks anything online. Coding doesn’t appear to be a thing.  There seem to be few networked sensors, as when attack after attack surprises enemies who only detect them visually (i. e. no radar, no distributed sensor arrays). Documents are unique, it seems, and hardly copied. This is true even of military documents —  ironic, given that one of the key motivators for creating ARPANET was preserving those very things. Weirdly, communication satellites don’t seem to exist, or at least matter. The movie is even more retro than this WWII level when it comes to media.  There are no cameras or microphones.  Nobody records, films, photographs, or surveils anyone else.  When a hologram recording (in all ways a film strip) plays, nobody makes a copy.  The one person who watched it simply remembers the gist, without bothering to shoot someone a copy or even write it down.  In fact, there aren’t any media, either entertainment or news.  You might expect a   empire fighting an insurgency to have a serious propaganda effort under way.  Instead it’s a semiliterate, nearly   realm. (For comparison’s sake consider the continuous stream of media populating Children of Men, enjoying a ten year anniversary.  Newspapers, radio, television offer an ongoing stream of information about that world.) Rogue One’s fierce   nature expresses itself in what we see of its world’s society and politics. Previous Star Wars movies described rebooted medieval and early modern sociopolitical structured lodged in interstellar space.  Hence an emperor rules an empire, and senators work alongside aristocrats and feudal power arrangements.  Unlike, say, Frank Herbert’s Dune universe, where changes in technology made older structures functional again, Star Wars just ignored any technological impact to copy and paste pulpy history onto the future. Rogue One continues this, unsurprisingly, with some updates towards the 19th and 20th centuries.  There’s the empire, of course, with its   mix of Nazis and Ming the Merciless.  Under its sway we see criminals, religious fanatics, and leftover warrior knights (Jedis, the Star Wars version of our world’s Teutonic Order).  Family relations are also from the early 20th century, a classic nuclear family (only one child) anchoring the protagonist.  Her gender roles are partly retro, too, as her mother matters far less than her father, and she risks her life and mission to save a child from a firefight. Advanced technology has not extended lifespans or eased health problems.  There are no signs of genetic engineering, medicine beyond 1950 (other than whatever the heck was involved in the heroine’s mentor’s outfit) or starvation alleviated by improved nutrition or even replicators.  Cities are   colonial in overcrowding and poor conditions.  It is as if technology has been abstracted away from social life, or is arrogated to a powerful elite who otherwise keeps the populace in relative degradation. Perhaps the galaxy is run by a group of historical reenactors who insist everyone join their hobby in a kind of vast dystopia. So why does Rogue One do this?  Obviously it wants to hew to the original movies, mostly the first one and Empire Strikes Back, so the movie matches its technology with theirs. We get a nice echo of that late ’  ’80s grungy technology vibe, as seen in, for example, Blade Runner and Alien. We don’t get   keyboards, smartphone, or time dilation problems because the source material lacks them. Beyond that formal reason, why would this fiercely retro approach appeal to today’s audience?  And appeal it does, with box office above $64 million as of today, per IMDB. We could ask them same question about similarly retro steampunk, as others have done.  The answers include a desire to flee what some see as daunting   in our present day, responding to feelings akin to Toffler’s famed future shock. But steampunk is a distinctly different era, anchored on Victorian Britain, not the 1930s, not dieselpunk. People like steampunk for many other reasons, including the fashions, and, I think, a strong sense of appropriated cultural smugness. No, Rogue One turns to the second World War because it wants that struggle’s cultural cachet. Evoking WWII sets the movie up for epochal struggles, a strong good versus evil theme, a seamy resistance plot, and especially massive amounts of sacrifice and death —  the very opposite of steampunk.  I wonder how this appeals to an America a decade and a half into the global war on terror.  Was the studio hoping to tap into residual anxieties about distant enemies and the burdens of empire? Were they counting on   somehow fading away? I suspect the   technology milieu engages two audiences. For younger people who’ve grown up with some degree of digital immersion this must appear to be an exciting alternate dimension. Rogue One is in this way akin to vinyl records and postcards.  For older people (generalizing here) it’s nostalgia. Not only does it remind us of seeing the first movie back during the Carter administration, but is also recalls traces of the world we thought we once inhabited. The tangible tech, bereft of PowerPoint and sleek touchscreens, reminds us of, say, shop class, working on cars, wiring up circuits. For both audiences Rogue One slyly connects with the maker movement. Meanwhile, both audiences can enjoy the movie, then write about it on their smartphones as they leave the theater, checking Twitter and Facebook for friends’ opinions, and consulting Rotten Tomatoes for more reviews. Let’s see how this determined   plays out in 2017’s popular culture."
The Bachelor Gives Nick the Redemption Edit,Atlantic,Megan Garber,2017-01-03,"There are many ways to be a villain on The Bachelor. You can be overly aggressive in pursuit of the Bachelor or Bachelorette whose heart —  and, in the meantime, whose rose —  you are seeking. You can be disrespectful of your fellow contestants. You can be overly emotional. You can be not emotional enough. Or you can be, if you are Nick Viall, all of those things at once: a   villain —  someone who is not villainous in one particular way, but whose villainy instead accretes, episode by episode, by way of bad behavior and good editing. In his two seasons as a contestant on The Bachelorette, Nick, a   software salesman from Wisconsin, annoyed the other guys by bragging about his connection with the Bachelorettes in question, and also by writing fawning poems, and also by singing weird songs with sexually explicit lyrics. During the live After the Final Rose special that concluded Andi’s season, Nick violated one of the cardinal, if unspoken, rules of Bacheloretteism: He discussed what happened between the two in the Fantasy Suite —  the one place where a couple can interact away from the show’s otherwise omniscient cameras. And he revealed that he and his   had indeed had sex during their stay in the Suite. Cue, for Andi, the  . So it was a matter of   controversy, then, when, in August, The Bachelor announced that Nick, for all this aggregated awfulness, would get rewarded with a prize that is even more valuable than a telegenically red rose: He would be the next Bachelor. Come January, Nick would have 30 women —  not just beautiful women, but also “accomplished” ones, the show goes out of its way to insist —  vying for his heart. It was a casting decision that presented a challenge for a show that, for all its glitter and fluff, revolves around its own implied moralities: about marriage and the path that should lead to it, about sex, about the things that make one, in one of the show’s recurring phrases, “deserving of love. ” With Nick, who snagged the bachelorship over the expected candidate, the sensitive cowboy Luke, The Bachelor’s producers needed to find a way to have it both ways: to benefit from the   drama of a controversial Bachelor while also maintaining the moralism of a televised mating routine that demands that its participants, all of them, be “there for the right reasons. ” Their solution, it seems: The Bachelor is insisting that its star, while still “controversial,” has changed. Nick is a villain no longer, it claims, but a man whose prior mistakes have now made him more intent than ever to Find Love. “This is the season of redemption,” Kathy Griffin —  yep, that Kathy Griffin —  announced in a special leading up to Monday’s season 21 premiere. And during the premiere itself, The Bachelor’s host, Chris Harrison, laid things out yet again: “From bad boy to Bachelor,” Harrison said, with ceremonial solemnity, “we’ve all seen Nick grow. ” With Nick’s season, the show that perfected the villain edit, and more recently the crazy edit, is giving its viewers a new one: the redemption edit. The groundwork for Nick’s comeback story was established this summer, when he made his third appearance on the franchise’s shows as a contestant on Bachelor in Paradise. That season’s villain spots being already occupied by Chad and Lace and Ashley, the show found another role for Nick: as a   adviser to Ashley, as a good boyfriend to Jen, as an affable friend to all. Nick’s willingness to participate in three rounds of   established him as the best thing the show can imagine a person to be: as someone who believes  in Love, and who is willing to undertake whatever ritual humiliations Journey might be necessary to find it. The Crazy Edit: The Colorful Cruelties of Bachelor in Paradise, That narrative spilled over into the new season of the show. Nick, The Bachelor’s Season 21 made clear on Monday, would redeem himself from his previous villainy not just by abandoning the antics of the past, but also by searching, with earnestness of heart and purity of purpose, for “a woman to spend his life with. ” Monday’s premiere began with Nick receiving adorable dating advice (be   be honest, “don’t mumble”) from his young sister. It continued with the typical stuff of Bachelor  : with shots of Nick joking with his large family (he’s one of 11 kids) and running, pensive and shirtless, and looking, longingly, into the middle distance. But the episode also added, for good measure, a heavy dose of payback. Many of the show’s new contestants, as they introduced themselves to their suitor on the   driveway of the Bachelor Mansion, made a point of bringing up Nick’s past to him. Taylor, a therapist from Seattle, announced at length that her friends had warned her about Nick and his villainous ways. Many of the other women ribbed him for being a   loser on the show. They all tempered the typical   with acknowledgements that, this time around, the Bachelor isn’t perfect. Instead, he’s perfectly flawed. He is probably, dear viewer, a lot like you. And so, with that, The Bachelor has found something that might well be as compelling,    as villainy: forgiveness. The Bachelor has always relied on fairy tale frames for its narrative drama now, it will be Nick —  Snow White clad in a   suit —  who may or may not be saved by his lover’s kiss. Will he be able to redeem himself, in the eyes of the women competing for him and in the eyes of the members of Bachelor Nation? Will he be there, in the end, For the Right Reasons? Will he be, finally, Deserving of Love?  If Nick “gets down on one knee” at the end of the series, Chris Harrison noted, soberly, during Monday’s premiere, “he’s also asking that person to forgive him for all the mistakes he’s made in his life. ” Or, as Nick put it to a fan, as he embarked on his    tour of the nation: “If we hug, will you, like, forgive me?”"
Mariah Carey Feeds the Schadenfreude Cycle,Atlantic,Spencer Kornhaber,2017-01-03,"On New Year’s Eve, Mariah Carey gave 2017 an ominous   by grimacing and complaining, rather than singing or even correctly   through two songs, later saying that technical errors prevented her from hearing her backing tracks. It was the kind of moment a fiction writer wouldn’t put on page for fear of being too unsubtle. Without 29 years in the public spotlight, without her unbeaten slew of No. 1 hits as a solo artist, without the gymnastic comparisons her vocal range once inspired, without her zany “diva” persona —  the     diet, the      policy, the “I don’t know her” moment —  and without her every recent singing error having gone viral, the internet might have served up some “welp, 2016” jokes and moved on. Instead, there were cracks like this —   2016 was channeling The Little Mermaid and ended the year by stealing Mariah Carey’s voice.  —  and images like this —   A photo posted by vincenzo (@vincent_casimir_) on Jan 3, 2017 at 1:47am PST,  —  both of which, knowingly or not, flip an internet fandom trope in which Carey is shown as Ursula and her presumed rival Ariana Grande plays Ariel. It’s a perfect example of how Carey has become a catchall target of attitudes about aging, femininity, and talent after all, the   read of The Little Mermaid is way too easy, with a girl made to trade her speech for love and an elder woman evilly coveting a younger woman’s abilities. Donald Trump Makes War on Celebrities, Carey has also long embodied America’s conflicting attitudes around celebrity, with the hunger to create idols matched by a hunger to tear them down. Her original success came from a physical gift —  a vocal range —  comparable to athletic ability, extraordinary but bound to diminish with time. Around that talent she built a persona, a business, a following, and an impressive recording catalogue, all of which remain intact even as her voice does what voices do: age. Her recent E! reality show, Las Vegas residency, and bookings like Times Square on New Year’s Eve demonstrate a demand for her to remain in the public eye. But the gleeful social media response to this latest bust of a performance also demonstrate how some element of tragedy is now part of her appeal. Carey knows America likes to laugh at her for evidence, see her tweet after the performance, or see the fact that she is blaming the New Year Eve debacle on sabotage. She wandered around without singing for two of the three songs she’d been set to perform, her camp says, because Dick Clark Productions repeatedly ignored Carey’s technical warnings —  perhaps for cynical reasons. “We live in this viral world where anybody will do anything for a viral moment,” Carey’s manager Stella Bulochnikov told EW. Dick Clark Productions has called such allegations “absurd,” but regardless of the truth of the matter, a viral moment happened, serving up something for everyone. The people who like to tell Carey to just quit got to sound off again. The folks morally opposed to   and backing tracks —  even in a loud,   environment like Times Square on New Year’s Eve —  got to preach their beliefs. Carey’s status as a    performance artist, commenting on fame and delusion simply by existing, was further cemented. The national pastime of resenting the rich while also paying them continued. And, more than anything, the Mariah Carey fan army got to do what it now exists to do: defend. It’s all a reminder that schadenfreude is one of the most powerful forces in pop culture —  a negative complement to the praise that makes any particular celebrity successful. Justin Bieber’s tabloid antics release   adult disdain for a boy superstar Kanye West’s mental health troubles gave some an opportunity to discredit his boasts to genius Kim Kardashian’s robbery was a chance to condemn conspicuous consumption. And Mariah Carey may not have performed her hits on New Year’s Eve, but other people got the pleasure of singing their same old songs about her."
27 Movies to Look Forward to in 2017,Atlantic,David Sims,2017-01-03,"Another year, another spell of films to anticipate, delight in, and dread. There will be sequels, superheroes, and Star Wars, of course, but there’s plenty else on offer from Hollywood this year —  and smaller projects in the hopper that are sure to surprise in the coming months. Here’s a look at some of 2017’s most notable projects. Split (January 20)  What It Is: M. Night Shyamalan (The Sixth Sense, Signs) having rediscovered his skill at making entertaining horror schlock with 2015’s The Visit, is back for more with a truly absurd   act. James McAvoy plays Kevin, a menacing predator who kidnaps three teenage girls and locks them in his basement they then realize that Kevin suffers from some (entirely fictional) form of   disorder that manifests as 23 different characters in one body. If You Need Convincing: After years in the Hollywood wilderness with flops like The Last Airbender and After Earth, Shyamalan has rediscovered his mojo by tapping back into the   charm that made him a star director in the first place. Split looks like a ridiculous, but entirely   thrill ride early reviews from Austin’s Fantastic Fest were largely positive. John Wick: Chapter Two (February 10)  What It Is: A sequel to one of the biggest cult surprises of the decade, this Keanu Reeves action thriller promises more of the same from 2014’s    sensation John Wick. Reeves plays Wick, a terrifying former hitman for the mob he’s lured out of retirement for some   reason ridiculous, balletic violence ensues. Joining the cast this time around are Common, Ruby Rose, and Reeves’s Matrix   Laurence Fishburne. If You Need Convincing: John Wick was one of the most genuinely electrifying things Hollywood has produced in years. It was trash, but glorious trash, with a visual panache and penchant for   that kept it from feeling disposable. It also correctly deployed Reeves, one of Hollywood’s most fascinating stars when given the right vehicle. The John Wick director Chad Stahelski is at the helm for Chapter Two, though his partner David Leitch has moved on to other projects. Hopefully lightning can strike again. The Great Wall (February 17)  What It Is: An epic fantasy drama from Zhang Yimou, one of the masters of contemporary Chinese cinema, about a gritty band of soldiers and bandits trying to protect the Great Wall of China from a monster invasion during the Song Dynasty. The most expensive Chinese film ever made, The Great Wall has already grossed a stupendous $150 million in its native country. If You Need Convincing: You may, considering the controversy that broke out last year upon the release of the film’s trailer, which emphasized Matt Damon over the other actors and drew complaints of whitewashing. Zhang and Damon have pushed back against the notion, saying the film is a historical fantasy and that Damon’s character was always written as white and is one of five heroes in the film (the other four are Chinese). Whatever the case, the film may herald the dawn of a more international era in   filmmaking, since worldwide audiences are more and more crucial to Hollywood profitability. Get Out (February 24)  What It Is: A satirical horror film from the director Jordan Peele, one half of Key  Peele. When Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) visits his white girlfriend’s family estate for the first time, he realizes that something bizarre is afoot, and frantically tries to escape after another African American in town warns him to “get out. ” Allison Williams, Catherine Keener, and Bradley Whitford   as the initially pleasant, but ultimately sinister, family. If You Need Convincing: Peele is a comic genius and a   horror fan. For his debut feature (he wrote and directed) he’s teamed with the veteran producer Jason Blum (Paranormal Activity, Insidious, and many more) to make something both genuinely scary and  . Peele has described Get Out as a   Stepford Wives. Logan (March 3)  What It Is: A   to Hugh Jackman’s   performance as the mutant superhero (coming 17 years after his first appearance in  ) Logan takes place in a vaguely apocalyptic future, where the clawed menace embarks on one last effort to protect a young mutant girl. If You Need Convincing: Superhero fatigue may well have set in a long time ago for some viewers, but Logan looks like a surprisingly   intense work, uninterested in tying into another other sequels or spinoffs. Its director James Mangold made the last, highly underrated Wolverine movie this one is rated R and promises both an adult tone and an actual ending for the character. Kong: Skull Island (March 10)  What It Is: The latest attempt to revive one of the most famous monsters in Hollywood history, this King Kong take veers away from the 1930s   of the last remake (Peter Jackson’s 2005 film, which hewed closely to the 1933 original). Instead set in the ’70s, Skull Island follows a group of explorers and soldiers who stumble across the giant ape. Tom Hiddleston, Samuel L. Jackson, Brie Larson, and John Goodman star. If You Need Convincing: Another King Kong film seems painfully unnecessary, and the film is being positioned as the start of a new franchise that will eventually cross over with Godzilla. But the trailer has a surprisingly peppy,   quality to it, promising glorious fun from its monster rather than the usual grim tragedy.     Beauty and the Beast (March 17)  What It Is: An unnervingly   remake of the 1991 Disney animated classic, starring Emma Watson as the   Belle, trapped in a castle with its monstrous lord (Dan Stevens) a prince transformed into a furry beast by a witch’s curse. Expect singing, dancing, and great heaps of CGI as these two crazy kids try to figure things out. If You Need Convincing: Well, Disney certainly doesn’t think you will. Its   remakes of animated classics (Maleficent, Cinderella, and The Jungle Book) have all been colossal successes, a good way to simultaneously appeal to older generations and younger viewers craving spectacle. From the opening bars of its score, Beauty and the Beast will play on its audience’s every nostalgic desire, and it’ll capture hundreds of millions of dollars in the process. The Fate of the Furious (April 14)  What It Is: The eighth (and certainly not final) entry in the sprawling cinematic franchise that has morphed from entertaining   drama into an arcane, colorful,   series of   spy capers. After bidding a sad goodbye to Brian (the late Paul Walker) in Furious 7, Fate is charting darker territory, with hero Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) seemingly turning to evil thanks to a new character, Cipher (Charlize Theron). One imagines that all is not as it seems. If You Need Convincing: Watch the previous seven Fast  Furious films. Their convoluted evolution from   car hijinks into a   action soap opera is unlike anything in recent Hollywood history, and will bond you to the franchise. The franchise’s incredible run can’t last forever, but so far it’s shown no sign of slowing down. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (May 5)  What It Is: The first of three (yes, three) Marvel movies in 2017 returns to the intergalactic fun of Peter Quill aka   (Chris Pratt) Gamora (Zoe Saldana) Rocket Raccoon (Bradley Cooper) and all the rest. Kurt Russell is on board this time as Peter’s mysterious father no doubt it will all have something to do with Infinity Stones again. If You Need Convincing: Guardians of the Galaxy is, pound for pound, the most entertaining film Marvel has ever produced, and its   James Gunn is back on board for the sequel. Also, Groot (Vin Diesel) is a little baby tree now, and if you aren’t sick of seeing him in advertising yet, you will be. Alien: Covenant (May 19)  What It Is: After largely baffling audiences with Prometheus, his 2012   to Alien, Ridley Scott seems to have returned to more conventional territory with Covenant, another adventure set before his 1979   horror classic. It’s about a spaceship that stumbles on some weird eggs on a mysterious planet and then gets terrorized by an alien. Sound familiar? If You Need Convincing: Scott seems aware that he alienated viewers by veering away from the Alien formula in some ways with Prometheus. Though he’s retained that film’s star Michael Fassbender (who plays dual roles here) he otherwise seems to be attempting a   of Alien, down to the new hero Daniels’s (Katherine Waterston)   short hair. Baywatch (May 26)  What It Is: A shameless effort to revive another ultimate ’90s brand, Baywatch features plenty of chiseled stars (Dwayne Johnson, Zac Efron, and Alexandra Daddario among them) as a team of   lifeguards. They’ll fight crime, run around on the beach, and wink to the camera as much as possible. David Hasselhoff and Pamela Anderson will contribute their expected cameos. If You Need Convincing: Then you’re not the ’  demographic that studios are banking on these days. At best, Baywatch might have the knowing comic touch of Zac Efron’s Neighbors films more likely, it’ll resemble the director Seth Gordon’s other perfunctory   efforts, like Horrible Bosses and Identity Thief. Wonder Woman (June 2)  What It Is: She fought alongside Batman and Superman last year, and now she gets a starring role. After decades of attempts, the famed Amazon warrior, certainly the most iconic female   superhero, is finally getting her own movie, directed by Patty Jenkins (Monster) and starring Gal Gadot. A period piece, the film will explain how Wonder Woman ended up in the modern world, departing her home island to fight in World War I alongside her love interest Steve Trevor (Chris Pine). If You Need Convincing: The DC Comics film universe has been deathly grim so far, with neither Batman v. Superman nor Suicide Squad winning over critics. Wonder Woman looks far brighter and more colorful in contrast. Marvel is still yet to produce a film starring a female superhero, so look for Warner Bros. to draw as much attention as possible to Gadot’s starring role. The Beguiled (June 23)  What It Is: Sofia Coppola’s first film since The Bling Ring (2013) is a remake of the 1971 Civil War drama, itself based on the Southern Gothic novel A Painted Devil. Colin Farrell will take Clint Eastwood’s original role as a Union soldier nursed back to health at an   Mississippi boarding school. Elle Fanning, Nicole Kidman, and Kirsten Dunst  . If You Need Convincing: Coppola’s last period film,   (2006) was a visually lush work that subverted many of the norms of the   costume drama. The 1971 version of The Beguiled is a fascinating, strange work that defies easy categorization Coppola has assembled a terrific cast to try and do the same in 2017.  : Homecoming (July 7)  What It Is: A new dawn in synergistic franchise programming, as Marvel Studios takes the reins of a character owned by Sony thanks to complicated,   bits of corporate machination. This iteration of   (played by Tom Holland) made his debut in Captain America: Civil War last year. In Homecoming, he’ll fight the Vulture (Michael Keaton) in his own movie, though Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) will  . If You Need Convincing: Captain America: Civil War was a strange   of a film, but Holland’s upbeat portrayal of a teenaged Peter Parker was its most winning element. We may not need a sixth   film in 15 years, but we’re getting one, so it’s nice that the casting is on point. Dunkirk (July 21)  What It Is: An epic recreation of the 1940 evacuation of Dunkirk, a miraculous rescue mission that saved hundreds of thousands of Allied soldiers in the beginnings of World War II. The director Christopher Nolan has assembled a huge ensemble for the film, ranging from frequent collaborators Tom Hardy and Cillian Murphy, to legendary thespians Mark Rylance and Kenneth Branagh, and One Direction’s Harry Styles. If You Need Convincing: Nolan is, for his flaws, one of the finest   filmmakers of the moment. Films like Inception, Interstellar, and his Batman trilogy work their hardest to deliver widescreen   without being overloaded with CGI. Dunkirk, shot entirely on   IMAX film stock, looks breathtaking, if nothing else. The Dark Tower (July 28)  What It Is: A   adaptation of Stephen King’s famed Dark Tower series, set in the mythical   a magical spin on the Old West. Idris Elba stars at Roland Deschain, a frontier knight who wields a pair of revolvers, while Matthew McConaughey plays the film’s villain, Walter Padick. If You Need Convincing: King describes the   saga as his magnum opus, and many directors have taken cracks at adapting it, including J. J. Abrams (who eventually decided he was too fond of the work to take the necessary plot liberties to translate it to screen) and Ron Howard. Howard eventually passed it along to Nikolaj Arcel, a Danish filmmaker who made the   A Royal Affair. Whether Arcel and the books can survive the move to   Hollywood remains to be seen, but it’s an exciting question. Baby Driver (August 11) What It Is: A   thriller about a young, talented getaway driver (Ansel Elgort) who works for different bank robbers and gets ensnared in trouble when a heist goes wrong. Jamie Foxx, Jon Hamm, Kevin Spacey, and Lily James make up the rest of the cast. If You Need Convincing: Baby Driver marks the return of the   Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World) to the big screen. After his last acclaimed project,   comedy The World’s End, he was sucked into and spat out of the Marvel engine, resigning from   during   over creative differences with the studio. Wright is one of the most exciting action directors alive, so Baby Driver should be a great engine for a comeback. American Made (September 29) What It Is: Based on a true story, American Made depicts the life of Barry Seal, a TWA pilot who became a drugs and weapons smuggler for the Medellin cartel, while also working for the DEA, eventually getting mixed up in the   scandal. Tom Cruise plays Seal, with Sarah Wright, Domhnall Gleeson, and Jesse Plemons  . If You Need Convincing: Cruise’s last project with American Made director Doug Liman was the fantastic   thriller Edge of Tomorrow. The role of Seal, who seems   at best, could be a fun departure for the star, who has largely stuck to genre films in recent years (he’ll also star in The Mummy this summer). Blade Runner 2049 (October 6) What It Is: Exactly what it sounds like —  a sequel to Ridley Scott’s 1982 masterpiece Blade Runner, set in the year 2049 (30 after the events of the first film). The plot that we know is pretty simple: LAPD Officer K (Ryan Gosling) a “blade runner” tasked with retiring android “replicants,” goes on a quest to find Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) who’s been missing since the events of the first film. If You Need Convincing: The plot might seem like a carbon copy of another   sequel, Star Wars: The Force Awakens. But the look of the film as seen in its announcement trailer is pretty   and director Denis Villeneuve made Arrival, one of the best films of 2016. Among the supporting cast are Mackenzie Davis, Jared Leto, and Robin Wright. Logan Lucky (October 13) What It Is: A comedy starring Channing Tatum and Adam Driver as brothers who plan a heist during a NASCAR race. Daniel Craig, Hilary Swank, Katherine Heigl, Katherine Waterston, Riley Keough, Seth MacFarlane, Katie Holmes, and Sebastian Stan make up the   cast. If You Need Convincing: The cast is that loaded because Logan Lucky is directed by the great Steven Soderbergh, who has ended his   retirement from filmmaking to make it. His retirement was   (only four years) but any Soderbergh project, no matter how thin the plot, is worth getting excited for. The Snowman (October 13) What It Is: An adaptation of Jo Nesbø’s bestselling detective novel, The Snowman follows Harry Hole (Michael Fassbender) as he investigates the disappearance of a woman whose scarf is found wrapped around a snowman. Rebecca Ferguson, J. K. Simmons, Val Kilmer, and Chloe Sevigny  . If You Need Convincing: This project was initially attached to Martin Scorsese, but it ended up in the hands of the Swedish director Tomas Alfredson, who made the delightfully moody Let the Right One In and Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. Nordic mysteries have been tough for Hollywood to translate, but Alfredson might have the right touch for it. Thor: Ragnarok (November 3) What It Is: The third entry in Marvel’s Thor series sees the Norse god of thunder (Chris Hemsworth) embark on some sort of intergalactic journey. His mischievous brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) will surely be involved, as will the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) and Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) Cate Blanchett plays the film’s villain Hela, while Tessa Thompson is the new love interest Valkyrie (Thor’s old beau, Natalie Portman, has decided she doesn’t want to make any more Marvel movies). If You Need Convincing: The Thor movies are almost criminally underrated, much happier to indulge in fun mystical antics without too much needless exposition, and anchored by Hemsworth and Hiddleston’s comedic chemistry. Ragnarok has a fantastic director: New Zealand’s Taika Waititi, whose What We Do in the Shadows (2014) and Hunt for the Wilderpeople (2016) were cult hits. Red Sparrow (November 10) What It Is: A spy thriller starring Jennifer Lawrence, based on the 2013 novel by CIA veteran Jason Matthews that was acclaimed for its attention to detail. Lawrence plays Dominika Egorova, a Russian intelligence officer who matches wits with a hotheaded rookie CIA agent (played by Joel Edgerton). If You Need Convincing: After delivering fairly sleepy performances in  : Apocalypse and Passengers last year, Lawrence is in need of a home run. Perhaps the director Francis Lawrence (no relation) who worked with her on the Hunger Games sequels, can conjure one from her. Justice League (November 17) What It Is: Superman (Henry Cavill) Batman (Ben Affleck) Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) Aquaman (Jason Momoa) The Flash (Ezra Miller) and the mysterious Cyborg (Ray Fisher) unite to battle evil as DC Comics’ famed  . Zack Snyder directs from a screenplay by Chris Terrio (Argo). If You Need Convincing: Snyder’s run as a   director is decidedly mixed (he made 300, Watchmen, Man of Steel, and Batman v. Superman) but he seems to have taken criticism on board. The   trailer for Justice League displayed a much lighter tone than usual for him, perhaps an acknowledgement that people actually like to have fun when they see superhero movies. Coco (November 22) What It Is: The second of two Pixar films this year (the first, Cars 3, comes out in June) Coco is an entirely original story inspired by the Mexican Day of the Dead. It’s the first Pixar feature to feature a   protagonist, but little is known about the plot other than that it follows    Miguel as he finds himself in the realm of the dead. If You Need Convincing: Pixar films have a storied track record, especially their original works (which are accompanied by a depressing number of sequels these days). Coco’s director Lee Unkrich last worked on the acclaimed Toy Story 3 his   Adrian Molina, wrote the film’s script and is a veteran of the animated department. Darkest Hour (November 24) What It Is: A historical drama focusing on British Prime Minister Winston Churchill (Gary Oldman) as he faces down Nazi Germany and “faces a crucial moment” at the beginning of World War II. Sure to be an Oscar player, given its heavily   protagonist and   release date. If You Need Convincing:  The director Joe Wright (Pride  Prejudice, Atonement) is in need of a rebound after Pan, his disappointing take on Peter Pan. Alongside Oldman, the film features Ben Mendelsohn as King George VI and John Hurt as Churchill’s predecessor Neville Chamberlain. Star Wars Episode VIII (December 15) What It Is: The eighth in a popular series of   films that have been kicking around Hollywood for the last few decades. Will likely make a few bucks at the box office. If You Need Convincing: At this point, you probably don’t, but the still untitled Episode VIII is in the hands of Rian Johnson, a generally brilliant director behind   works of genius like Brick and Looper. Also, maybe this time Luke Skywalker will get some lines!"
How Trump Had It Both Ways on Congressional Ethics,Atlantic,David A. Graham,2017-01-03,"This post was updated on January 3 at 12:24pm.   Donald Trump has shown a rare talent for leaving his own allies and friends in a difficult and awkward spot, and he demonstrated that talent again on Monday, weakly condemning a move by House Republicans to gut the Office of Congressional Ethics as a misplaced priority, while also calling the office “unfair” —  a very public demonstration of why even the  ’s strongest allies sometimes find it difficult to follow his lead. Within hours of his tweets, and amid broad public outcry, the House Republican caucus called an emergency meeting, and pulled the amendment —  a black eye for the congressional GOP and its leadership, perhaps made even more humiliating by the public rebuke from their own  . Trump weighed in around 10 a. m. on Tuesday, about 14 hours into a hubbub over the House move. With all that Congress has to work on, do they really have to make the weakening of the Independent Ethics Watchdog, as unfair as it, . .... ...may be, their number one act and priority. Focus on tax reform, healthcare and so many other things of far greater importance! #DTS, At first glance, it looked as if Trump was picking a fight with Congress, which to a certain extent he is. But that overstates what he actually said. Trump went out of his way to acknowledge the complaint, voiced by some members of Congress, that the ethics committee stepped on their   rights and was  . (Norm Ornstein makes the case for the committee here.) His only complaint was about the timing and priority of the move needless to say, Trump would like the House to focus first on the things that he cares about most. Trump’s tweets seem to demonstrate his keen ability to read an audience and react. They came after hours of pushback, but at a time when the fate of the amendment still seemed undecided —  and leaning toward survival. By stepping into the debate when he did, he may have helped tip the balance against it, but he may also have jumped in just in time to claim credit for a shift that was already underway. Put yourself in the shoes of Representative Bob Goodlatte, who on Monday put forward an amendment in the GOP Conference to gut the office. On the one hand, Trump spent the last month of the campaign claiming he would “drain the swamp” of corruption in Washington, while Speaker Paul Ryan and Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, the House Republican leaders, both opposed Goodlatte’s amendment. On the other hand, Trump demonstrated no public interest in fighting corruption since he got elected, and has obstinately refused to acknowledge, much less mitigate, his own conflicts of interest. It must have seemed like a safe bet that the   would look the other way. The GOP’s Ethics Disaster  That’s presumably what Kellyanne Conway, a Trump adviser, was surmising when she went on MSNBC’s Morning Joe on Tuesday and faced a series of hostile questions about the House Republicans’ move Monday night. While Conway said she had not spoken with Trump about the vote, she offered a strong defense of gutting the office, saying that the GOP maintaining control of Congress meant “there’s a mandate there for them to make significant change. ” Ryan was left somewhere in the middle, too. He opposed the move within the conference, but he still allowed the rules package to proceed. Shortly after Trump’s tweets, he issued a long statement trying to have it several ways. The speaker acknowledged, “After eight years of operation, many members believe the Office of Congressional Ethics is in need of reform to protect due process and ensure it is operating according to its stated mission,” but he also insisted he had “made clear to the new Chair of the House Ethics Committee that it is not to interfere with the Office’s investigations or prevent it from doing its job,” a somewhat toothless demand. Trump’s mild scolding does point to the tensions to come between the White House and the Republican Congress, which have made great efforts to project unity, despite Trump’s   departures from —  and sometimes flagrant disrespect for —  the party line. One division is on Russia, where Trump has refused to even countenance the idea that the Kremlin was involved in malicious hacking in the presidential campaign, while many GOP members of Congress see it as dangerous intervention by a hostile regime. Gutting the OCE is another case where congressional Republicans have their own interests, and intend to pursue them. After all, the GOP caucus has undercut ethics rules before the OCE was created after a series of scandals involving Republican members and members have wanted to remove that threat for some time. After calling an emergency meeting around noon, the House Republican caucus abruptly reversed course, removing the amendment to gut OCE from the rules package —  a reversal as sudden as the introduction of the rule. That’s embarrassing for Goodlatte, perhaps the only member who is known to have supported the amendment, since the vote on it was private and anonymous. Ryan, whose Tuesday morning statement signaled acquiescence with his caucus, is also caught somewhat out in the open, showing that his control over members is weak. But Trump wins, as he always seems to do: He gets credit for helping sink the maneuver, imparting some “drain the swamp” glow without his actually taking steps to fight corruption, or even to condemn dismantling ethics watchdogs. And how could he have done otherwise? Picking a real fight with Congress on ethics would carry the risk that it might have a change of heart and actually start pushing Trump for accountability on his own ethical challenges. Moving to pass the ethics rules now was a page torn right out of the Trump playbook: The theory is that you can get away with doing things that are egregious violations of norms, and even ones that might be politically toxic if handled through the typical political process, if they are instead dealt with brusquely, casually, and secretively. By the time the gutting of OCE was known, it was already passed and incorporated into the rules package, and the opponent best positioned to stop it, Paul Ryan, had already been steamrolled. But they play turned out not to work as well for the House as it has for the  . It will be much harder to pass later, after having been pulled for public outcry. The abrupt demise of the amendment suggests two lessons for Republicans in Congress: Guessing Trump’s mind is impossible, and the tactics that work for him are liable to blow up in anyone else’s face."
The Original Sharing Economy,Atlantic,Ilana E. Strauss,2017-01-03,"At the Sharing Depot, a storefront in Toronto, $50 a year buys tens of thousands of dollars’ worth of tools, camping supplies, furniture, games, toys, sports equipment, and much else. At least on a   basis: The owners of the space call it a “library of things,” and anyone who pays the annual membership fee can borrow anything in the Sharing Depot, whose aisles look a lot like those at a regular   store. The difference is that everything on the shelves can be checked out like a library book. Ryan Dyment, a   of the Sharing Depot, explained that his business takes advantage of the fact that people own things they hardly ever use. “We’ve produced way more than what we need to live well,” Dyment says. “There are basements and garages full of stuff. ” The Sharing Depot opened in 2013 and currently has more than 2, 200 members. Roughly a dozen stores around the world call themselves libraries of things, but unofficial sharing libraries are much more plentiful. According to Dyment, there are about 80 tool libraries established in North America, Europe, and Oceania, and there are probably many more that operate on smaller scales. Also, lots of equipment owned by universities is available for public use, and farmers sometimes develop   programs to spread out the cost of using large machinery. Aside from promoting a spirit of community, the Sharing Depot’s model is also financially beneficial for the people who use it. Borrowing instead of buying can save money, and it makes it easier for people to obtain things that would usually be beyond their means. “It levels the playing field, when everyone has access to the same things,” Dyment explains. He says his kids can now, for instance, “get new toys every week if they want to. ” Likewise, when Dyment sold his car and started using a   service, he says it saved him $10, 000 a year. People who share don’t “have to play this game of ‘How do I get enough digits in my imaginary bank account to access these things? ’” he says. And sharing is of course easier on the environment. “Our economic model doesn’t work with the environmental needs we have,” Dyment says. “I think we need to move to a situation where people are working less and consuming less, but they’re sharing more. ” He laments that so many   products are now made not with durability in mind, but with an eye on planned obsolescence. Stronger,   products would be, among other things, better for sharing. Today, it’s taken for granted that nearly all objects belong to someone. But while the spirit of the Sharing Depot is a break with the present, it has historically been the norm:   —  which is what humans were for most of the time they’ve been humans —  are thought to have shared nearly everything. According to Sam Bowles, a professor of economics at the University of Massachusetts,   likely didn’t have a conception of private property. “Among mobile   during the late Pleistocene, food was almost certainly widely shared as it was acquired,” Bowles wrote in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. “If you didn’t share,” he says, “you’d be violating a basic social norm. ” And according to the anthropologist David Graeber’s 2013 book Debt: The First 5, 000 Years, the Iroquois used to stockpile goods in longhouses, and women’s councils would decide who could use what. This jives with the communal storage spaces that archaeologists have found at the sites of villages of some   who were among the first to turn sedentary. This idea of sharing everything matches observations of   tribes that still exist today. “They’re very free with one another’s things,” explains Daniel Everett, an anthropologist at Bentley University who spent years studying the Pirahã, a group of   in the Amazon. Everett remembers lending things to the Pirahã, only to find that the borrowers were “continually mystified” when he came back to pick up an item. “They are always incredulous when I’d come over to get it,” he says. “I wasn’t using it, and they needed it, so what’s the big deal?” He explains that, while one person in the group might primarily own an object, the property is all but private. “They frequently take each others’ things, and there’s no fuss about it,” he adds. Bowles, based on his and others’ research, thinks that private ownership may have originated around 11, 000 years ago, as humans started farming. Agriculture and private property likely evolved together, since farmers are generally loath to let others reap what they have sown. As some   settled down in fishing villages and other areas where there was plenty of food to be found or grown, they started building private living spaces. Archeological evidence suggests that they slowly stopped storing food communally and started keeping it in their houses instead. “What farming allowed people to do is take a very small plot of land or particular group of animals   …     and say, ‘This is mine,’” Bowles explains. But farming was “not a bargain in terms of standard of living,” Bowles says. An hour of farming actually yielded fewer calories than an hour of hunting and gathering, and early farmers were shorter, had worse teeth, and were likely less healthy than  . But the populations of farmers grew more quickly than those of the     largely because being rooted makes it easier to have a lot of kids: It’s hard to take care of lots of young children when constantly on the move. A group of   might consist of only 30 adults, while a farming village might have thousands. This population disparity made it easier for farmers to take over  ’ territory and use it for farmland. “They eventually took over the world,” says Bowles, and they brought their system of property rights with them. Indeed, that’s essentially what happened only a few centuries ago as Europeans arrived in Australia, Africa, and the Americas, where some peoples were   some were farmers, and some were something in between. But until the 1700s, nearly every human settlement —  even long after conceptions of private property had taken shape —  had a “commons,” shared land that locals could use for farming crops and grazing animals. In medieval England, local juries decided who was allowed to use certain tracts in what was a pretty democratic system, explains Ellen Rosenman, a University of Kentucky professor who specializes in English history. The governing of the commons wasn’t completely egalitarian —  wealthy farmers had extra influence, for instance. But people who truly needed something got it: Villages set extra land aside for the poor, and the extremely rich were often not allowed to use common land. “Sometimes people who had no money were allowed to use the land for free,” Rosenman says. Unlike modern farmland, which is usually divided into   parcels, English commons were doled out in strips. As a result, farmers would work alongside each other, making it easier to share tools and help each other out. “In general, it was a more communal way of life,” Rosenman explains. “It was designed so that everyone in the community could survive. ” This all started to change during the Industrial Revolution, when better technology made farming much more profitable. Businesspeople, seeing a new opportunity, were eager to grow food, and governments were apparently happy to give them the land to do it: A slew of what were called “Inclosure Acts” were passed in the U. K. between 1750 to 1850, explains Rosenman, as communal land was given over to individuals, most of them wealthy. “Big land owners kind of gobbled [the commons] up,” Rosenman says. “By the time it was all done, there was virtually no common land anymore. ” According to Rosenman, the farmland itself suffered as a result. Laborers hired by big landowners weren’t all that invested in the land they were working on, so they didn’t always take care of it very well —  a historical echo of Dyment’s   complaint that many consumer goods aren’t designed or bought with   usage in mind. Historians disagree about how these acts affected people’s lives. Some, for instance, note that many at the time were excited that farming had become more efficient. But Rosenman points out that that the vast majority of   writers considered these land claims a disaster. Commoners lost their farms, and with them, “they lost their claim to being part of the nation,” Rosenman says. “The psychic consequences” —  a reduced sense of independence and identity —  “were massive. ” The English commons are a pretty good example of how land went from public to private in other places throughout history: New technologies made industrial agriculture viable, wealthy landowners overtook small farms, and displaced farmers found work elsewhere, a lot of the time in factories. This script did not always play out without resistance, though. A variety of communities —  from native groups to   laborers to religious orders —  have fought against the idea of private property. In the 1500s, for instance, some adherents of Anabaptism, a branch of Christianity, argued that private property contradicted Jesus’s view that God created the world for everyone. Acting on their views, they took over a town in Germany and outlawed private property. “God had made all things common, as today we can still enjoy air, fire, rain, and the sun in common, and whatever else some thieving, tyrannical man cannot grasp for himself,” preached one of the Anabaptists’ leaders.   communities that discourage private ownership are less rebellions than they are isolated pockets of   cultures.   American utopian communities proposed a more communal way of life, just like the   Israeli kibbutzim, which often share everything from food to tools to laundry machines. In a similar vein, Amish communities have “barn raisings” in which whole communities get together to build a barn for an individual. But today, the sharing that most people engage in is more often digital: Music, games, videos, computer code, programs, ideas, research, and articles are all frequently shared for free online, to the point that the internet is the closest thing there is to a   commons. And in what has come to be called “the sharing economy,” the internet enables people to sell access to everything from extra bedrooms to car rides to video equipment. Companies such as Uber and Airbnb allow people to quickly and efficiently secure temporary use of things that belong to someone else. But   companies exist in the same economy that McDonald’s and Starbucks do. Uber, Airbnb, and the like ultimately depend on profit, not generosity. Ownership is still private everything is rented, not truly shared. The sharing economy might be a significant step toward more efficiently tapping into the wealth of physical things owned by individuals —  as opposed to corporations —  but it’s still vastly different from the kind of sharing that defined humanity for tens of thousands of years."
The Friendship That Created Behavioral Economics,Atlantic,Bourree Lam,2017-01-03,"The term “the economic man,” or homo economicus, is attributed to John Stuart Mill. It represents one way economists have studied people for decades —  as rational,   actors whose behaviors and actions can be modeled. But then came the psychologists. Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky are often referred to as the fathers of behavioral economics, for demonstrating that the human brain relies on mental shortcuts and biases in   which often leads people to irrational ends. Kahneman won the Nobel Prize in economics in 2002, for ”for having integrated insights from psychological research into economic science, especially concerning human judgment and   under uncertainty.” In 2011, he wrote a   book, Thinking Fast and Slow, about his research with Tversky. The pair might seem an unlikely subject for writer Michael Lewis, who wrote the bestsellers Moneyball, The Big Short, and Flashboys. In his new book, The Undoing Project, Lewis tells the the lives of Kahneman and Tversky, the friendship that ungirded their   research, and ultimately how that friendship unraveled due to physical distance (when the two took jobs at different institutions) and tension over recognition of the work they did together. I talked to Lewis about why he wrote about two academics, the impact of their research, and the 2016 election through the lens of Kahneman and Tversky. A lightly edited transcript of our conversation is below. Bourree Lam: Why you decided to pursue this book project about Kahneman and Tversky and their research? In the preface, you mention Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein’s review of Moneyball, which pointed out that what you described in that book was essentially behavioral economics. But The Undoing Project also seems to me a labor of love. Michael Lewis: The reason I got so interested in the first place was just that spending time with Danny Kahneman was so interesting. I wanted to go back for more, without ever thinking that this was going to be a book. [The project] immersed me in him, and becoming immersed in him meant becoming very familiar with his relationship with Amos. Then I thought: I had this privileged access I had this combination of a relationship with Danny and a prior relationship with Amos’s son, who was my student at [the University of California]. I didn’t know he was Amos’s elder son at the time, I just knew him as Oren Tversky, but I was very fond of him and we were friends. The Tversky family was willing to open up to me. The more I learned about it, I thought: These guys were for the ages. If you could have been a fly on the wall with Freud, or Darwin, or Einstein   …     I thought these guys were a big deal, and nobody had told their story. I didn’t have any doubts about the importance of the subject. What compelled me to do it —  though I didn’t feel like it was naturally my subject —  was a feeling that if I didn’t, no one else would because no one else would have the access. Lam: How much time did you spend with Danny? And when did you decide it was time to start writing? Lewis: (Laughs) You know, you stop counting. We first met in the end of 2007. We made a trip to Israel together. I went and helped teach his class at Princeton. We’d go for long walks in the hills of Berkeley when he was here three months of the year. I don’t know how much time when you add it all up together, but enough time so that there wasn’t anything I didn’t hear three times. I’ve had this with subjects often, where they think I’m stupid because I’m asking the same question in a different way for the eighth time, just trying to see if there’s anything else there —  a memory, an insight —  and I could tell I was getting that way with him towards January of [last] year. There wasn’t much left to talk about that we hadn’t talked about 18 different ways. In the course of thinking about the book, I laid it out over a period of a couple years, it becomes clear what you need, what material is necessary. Once all the gaps are filled in, I don’t feel like there’s much work left to do on the reportorial side. I just sense that I have the story in my head and I’m ready to write. Lam: The three pillars of the book are biographical stories about Kahneman and Tversky, the way their personal stories informed their relationship —  which led to their Nobel winning work. How did you see the balance and interconnectedness of those three elements, and what fascinated you about them? Lewis: It’s funny, I didn’t think of the structure that way. I was telling the story of this relationship, but I knew I wanted to do something tricky with the structure. I wanted to cut out quickly into the world and show the ideas at play in the world. The book opens with 30 pages in a basketball front office, and my struggle was: How do I weave their relationship and the creation of the ideas together with the consequences of their ideas in the world? I was constantly struggling with, how do I jam the reader’s nose into the fact that this is not just two academics in a room spinning   ideas that have nothing to do with anything in the world? How do I jam the reader’s nose into the consequences, like life and death in the world, or decisions about human beings in the labor markets? That, for me, was the thing I just agonized over. Lam: What was it like to write about academics, and specifically these two? Lewis: I can’t think of another intellectual project that touches as much of human existence as their work in such an interesting way. I think they’re very unusually important and relevant. If they were just academics, I never would have even begun this project. What drew me to them was the life of their ideas outside of academia, and that they themselves were constantly thrust into practical affairs by Israel. The fact that they had spent time on the battlefield, and were constantly kind of on call by the Israeli government and the Israeli military. .. Their unusual interaction with the world outside of academia made the story possible. If it were just two guys in a room, I never would have written it. They’re constantly being stimulated by stuff outside of the academy. Much of their work is mocking the academy. Amos explicitly and Danny implicitly end up having very little time for their own field. They create their own subfield within the field, and then they go about poking holes in economics. A lot of their interactions with their fellow academics are   …     it’s not hostile but it’s certainly ironic and irreverent. I also thought that possibly a lot of academics would benefit from every six years going to shoot at people and get shot at. Lam: Really? Lewis: Yes. I think that it sort of puts everything in perspective. These guys were never going to have time for petty academic battles, and they had a gift for avoiding getting sucked into them. They’ve got the perspective of what people who are fighting actual battles go through. They’re not interested in the little things they’re interested in the big things. I think they get that perspective because it’s forced upon them, because this all might end at any moment. There’s an urgency to their academic life, their intellectual life, that I think grows out of their experience in Israel. Lam: Can you say more about what you found interesting about the way their ideas reach beyond academia? A lot of readers know you as a storyteller of narratives about money or finance. How does this book fit into the repertoire of your work? Lewis: Some of my work, at least, is clearly exploring the weird things that markets do. They screw up the value of baseball players they screw up the value of   securities. Even the political book I wrote, I found myself drawn to a candidate the process had no time for because his type wasn’t valued. So the distortion of value that goes on in markets or in people’s minds directly connects up to [Kahneman and Tversky’s] work. Moneyball comes right out of their work. Why do professional athletes get so badly misvalued? Part of the answer is there are distortions and kinks in the minds of the people doing the evaluations, and these guys were exploring that. I wasn’t interested in them just because I thought they helped explain some of their work, I was interested in them in particular because of the intensity of their feelings for each other. But there’s no question that in their work are ideas that I wasn’t even aware had come from them. I’ve been obsessed since I left Wall Street with the problems of financial advice. I just don’t understand why people take it. These guys have a lot to say about that, and they also have a lot to say about why people shouldn’t take it. Their work on randomness —  how people see random sequences as not random and see patterns where none exist —  you see this everywhere. You see this in people getting a reputation for being really great with money, you see it in people getting a reputation for being really great at picking hits in the movie business, or picking baseball players in the draft. Many of the things around us have a random component a lot of luck involved. The human mind doesn’t see the luck, it sees the pattern and this is one of their first great insights. Lam: Another one of their great insights is how predictable and systematic mistakes and thinking errors can be. Lewis: That’s the very big idea that collides with economics. If the mistakes aren’t systematic, then economics can ignore them. They’re showing that we’re hardwired for certain types of mistakes, so people are mostly going to make these mistakes. Then you have the beginning of a story where whole markets can go wrong, and this is what Richard Thaler picks up on. He thinks of them as having one idea: systematic error. That would be filtering it through the lens of an economist who’s dissatisfied with the   model in economics. I think they have dozens of ideas. So, back to your first question, about what got me into this. When I would go out for walks with Danny, this stuff just tumbles out of him. I thought, this is just gold. This guy is, and, even dead, Amos was full of all of these nuggets of wisdom that if you add them all up together, they’re more important than the formal work. Lam: Your work has been about market failures in different realms, so I have to ask, are you going to write about this last election? Lewis: [Laughs] I have to ask, should I? Do you think anybody’s going to want to read anymore about this? Everybody wants to know what happened. Everybody wants their dream explained, because everybody feels like they woke up and are still in this dream. I have no plans to write about this, I certainly don’t have plans to write about the election. That’s not to say I won’t. Now, if someone called me from inside one of the campaigns and told me, ”You know, there’s a part of the story no one’s ever told. Here’s all of the information,” I mean, I’d be   to resist it. But I’m not actively pursuing it. I’m more interested in what happens next. Lam: I do feel like people are trying to gain some insight from The Undoing Project regarding the 2016 election though. Lewis: Well, it’s a market for a politician, but people have this sense that the market did something really screwy, and they’re not unjustified. There’s a very clear sense right now that a lot of the people who voted for Trump may not have been voting in their best interests. It really seems like an irrational act to put this man in office, especially to people who didn’t vote for him. And so people want to understand what was going on in the minds of these people. I did find myself listening with a kind of Kahneman and Tversky ear to what was going on around me after the election. But the first thing I noticed was how people undid it. You could predict, given their discussions, how the imagination works and how the undoing was going to get harder and harder. As Danny points out, when a tragedy just happens, it’s easy to undo it. You start from the event, and the first thing that you can undo moving backwards in time and change the result, you change: So the FBI director’s email, or the ground ball that goes through the first baseman’s legs in the bottom of the ninth inning, or the   kicker missing at the end of the game. This is all the same stuff. But then what happens is, the consequences of Trump pile up. To undo the election, your mind has to undo all this other stuff that happens as a result of Trump being elected, and you just stop doing it. It will seem quaint in six months to be talking about the FBI director and what he did with the emails people won’t feel that it changed everything. There’ll be a sense that this was always going to happen, that we were always going to have Trump as President, that whatever happens will feel more determined or more inevitable or fated than it actually was. I was listening to that, this brief moment after the election where people appreciated that this wasn’t a deterministic event and lots of things could have happened to prevent Trump from being president, but their minds fixated on just a couple of those things. I don’t think Trump knows any of this. I think he’s just making it all up as he goes along, but he’s really   to being both a victim and a beneficiary of the [human thinking] mistakes that Danny and Amos point out. He’s pure intuitive judgment, and he’s appealing to other people’s pure intuitive judgment. There’s no real strong rational argument he’s making about why he should be president. Lam: But that’s why many people remain confused that he won. Lewis:  That’s right. He’s saying, vote for me, trust your gut. If you look at what Danny and Amos studied, it’s just that. Somewhere in the back of people’s minds, when they’re trying to connect my book up to the election, that’s what’s in their minds. But I didn’t write it because of the election. I’ve been doing this for eight years. I didn’t see any of this coming. I didn’t connect any of it to the election or anything like that, so this is just an accident."
The Most Vulnerable NASA Missions Under Trump,Atlantic,Marina Koren,2017-01-03,"About a week before the presidential election, NASA invited reporters to its facility in Greenbelt, Maryland to look at the observatory it hopes to launch in two years, to a point far beyond Hubble’s orbit, where it will continue that telescope’s search for distant stars and galaxies. Charlie Bolden, the head of the space agency, took questions, including one from a reporter for The Guardian, who asked Bolden whether the program was safe, regardless of the election’s outcome. Bolden cracked up immediately, and the rest of the room followed. He explained that most of the billions of dollars in funding the James Webb Space Telescope received was spent early on in its   development. He wasn’t worried now, “but I think anybody would be crazy to tell you that anything survives over a transition.” Bolden, along with many in the room, believed back then what the polls and the pundits did: Donald Trump wasn’t going to be elected president. A week later, few were laughing. The day after the election, Bolden sent a memo to NASA employees that likely wouldn’t have been necessary had the country elected Hillary Clinton. After all, Clinton had vowed to continue the work NASA did under the Obama administration. “In times when there has been much news about all the things that divide our nation, there has been noticeable bipartisan support for this work,” Bolden wrote. Because of that, “I think we can all be confident that the new Trump administration and future administrations after that will continue the visionary course on which President Barack Obama has set us. ” Some projects, like the James Webb Space Telescope, are safer than others under a Trump administration. Webb, an $8. 8 billion enterprise, has been in the works for two decades and employs hundreds of people. Trump, like most presidential candidates, said little about space policy on the campaign trail. Most voters want to hear about the economy, not Europa. “Right now, we have bigger problems —  you understand that?” Trump told a    boy at a campaign event in New Hampshire last November, when the child asked about NASA. “We’ve got to fix our potholes. You know, we don’t exactly have a lot of money. ” For now, imagining space policy under a Trump administration is akin to reading tea leaves. The same goes for future funding for NASA, which could be sapped to help pay for completely unrelated programs, like large tax cuts or expensive infrastructure repairs. A new NASA administrator won’t be named until next year, and, barring any foreshadowing tweets, Trump could wait, as Obama did, until his second year in office before formally announcing his   agenda. But Trump’s space policy has already begun to take shape, and there’s plenty to divine. His team for NASA began meeting with agency employees at the start of this month. His picks for top administration jobs so far, combined with his biggest   allies in Congress, suggest a future that’s good for   exploration, but bad for climate research. The NASA’s earth sciences division, which studies climate change and environmental conditions on Earth, is perhaps at greatest risk. In an October   in SpaceNews, a pair of Trump advisers wrote that “NASA should be focused primarily on   activities rather than   work that is better handled by other agencies. ” The agency, they said, focuses too much on “politically correct environmental monitoring. ” The division has seen increases in funding in the last eight years, but Republicans in Congress have proposed cuts at every turn. With both the White House and Congress in Republican hands,   experts are bracing for significant losses. One of the authors of the   Bob Walker, a former chairman of the House committee on science, space and technology, said last month Trump’s decisions surrounding NASA “will be based upon solid science, not politicized science,” like climate change. The same   dismissed the concept of rocket launch systems that are completely bankrolled by the taxpayer money, arguing instead for the investment of reusable systems developed by private companies like SpaceX and Orbital ATK. The authors were referring to the Space Launch System (SLS) the rocket Congress instructed NASA to build in 2011 to someday launch astronauts to Mars. Greg Autry, a professor at the University of Southern California and one of the members of Trump’s transition team for NASA, has criticized the SLS, saying it lacks ”both innovation and a mission.” He has proposed cutting funding for the program altogether and supporting   developers. Many scientists and the Obama administration agree, and the president has proposed cuts to the program. The SLS is a young project, with construction starting in 2014. But the system has staunch supporters in Congress, especially among Republicans who represent states where the system is being developed. Richard Shelby and Jeff Sessions, the Republican senators from Alabama, have fought cuts proposed by the Obama administration. Sessions is also Trump’s pick for attorney general. Trump advisers are also skeptical of the Asteroid Redirect Mission (ARM) an   program to send astronauts to visit an asteroid by the 2020s and test technology that could be beneficial for a Mars trip. The program has lackluster support among scientists and even less in Congress, where Republican lawmakers have tried to block its funding. Last month, Texas congressman Lamar Smith, chairman of the House committee on science, space, and technology and an early Trump ally, asked NASA to show lawmakers the merits of ARM. If Trump wanted the program gone, he wouldn’t have to try too hard. Smith supports other   missions, like sending spacecraft to search for signs of life in the subsurface ocean of Europa, Jupiter’s icy moon. There is one   policy that Trump could preserve —  and even expand. Each year, Obama has requested from Congress more funds for NASA’s commercial spaceflight program, which invests in private companies designing launch systems. Trump’s advisers have described such   partnerships as the “foundation” for   efforts. Trump recently named Elon Musk, the CEO of SpaceX, to an economic advisory team, and has met with Jeff Bezos, the founder of spaceflight company Blue Origin, despite their contentious relationship over The Washington Post. Some programs could be tougher to amend than others. NASA has been on a very public trajectory to Mars for nearly seven years —  and Congress, in an unusual show of bipartisanship, wants to keep it that way. Earlier this month, the Senate unanimously passed legislation that amends current law by adding human exploration of Mars to one of NASA’s objectives. The bill —  which is not expected to become law this year but could come up again in the next Congress —  is intended to make it politically difficult for future administrations to drastically alter NASA’s plans to send astronauts to Mars by the 2030s. The legislation is sponsored by Republican Senator Ted Cruz, a supporter of   exploration. The bill wouldn’t stop Trump, if he wanted to, from switching NASA’s main goal to a return to the moon first before Mars —  a move that would likely be welcomed by his adviser, Newt Gingrich, a   advocate. It would mark a radical shift in NASA’s mission, but such change wouldn’t be unprecedented. In 2008, presidential candidate Barack Obama said NASA had “lost focus. ” When he entered office, he quickly canceled the Constellation program, created under George W. Bush to return humans to the moon by 2020. When Trump takes office, some programs could disappear like Constellation did. Like Bolden said last month, it’d be crazy to think anything survives a transition."
The Mysterious Physics of Rainbows ,Atlantic,Jon Butterworth,2017-01-03,"This summer I went on a family holiday to Cornwall, on the Helford River. The peninsula south of the river is, rather wonderfully, called The Lizard. Standing on its cliffs, you are at the southernmost point of mainland Britain. North of the river is the port of Falmouth, from where   kept the mail services of the British Empire running until 1851. The area is lush with the sort of   beauty that England does so well, and the boundary with the contrasting wildness of the Atlantic is never far away. Walking home from a riverside pub one evening, I witnessed a stirring natural display. With the sun setting at our backs, a fantastically bright and complete double rainbow framed the   leading out to the sea. I have always loved rainbows, and this was the best one I have seen. It even came in front of the horizon, past the trees on the riverbank opposite, and merged with its reflection in the river. It was an invitation and a dare to scientific understanding. The image hovering in front of me was formed by sunlight streaming from behind us, internally reflected back towards us by myriad tiny suspended raindrops. When light meets an interface between air and water —  the surface of a raindrop —  some of it is reflected and some of it passes through. The angle of refraction depends both on the light’s wavelength and on the angle at which it hits the surface. Parallel rays entering a spherical raindrop bounce off the inside and come back towards us. The reflection angle from the back of the raindrop, combined with the two refractions (one as it enters the drop, and one as it leaves) conspire to concentrate each wavelength of light at a certain return angle. Wavelength corresponds to color, so the colors separate into the familiar bands. That is really all the physics you need to understand the basics of a rainbow. The first rainbow calculations were carried out by René Descartes back in 1637, although the dependence on wavelength, and hence the colors, needed Isaac Newton and Thomas Young’s later contributions. Although I already knew this history in principle, it was fresh in my mind because of a lovely review article by Alexander Haussmann of the Technical University in Dresden that I’d come across the same week. Haussmann’s review is full of both science and charm, and, unlike John Keats’s poor Lamia, the rainbow unwoven shines brighter for it. One thing adding to my wonder at the Cornwall rainbow was my realization that the reflection I could see in the river was, despite appearances, not a reflection of the rainbow in the sky. A true reflection happens when light from the same object, but at a different angle, reaches the eye after bouncing off a surface. For instance, the clouds I could see mirrored in the surface of the river were true reflections. But a rainbow is made up from light reflected internally in raindrops and emitted at a specific angle that is why we see the bow at all. It is not possible for the mirror image to be made from light reflected from the same drops, because it would have to have been emitted at a different angle in order to get to our eye. Instead, the mirror image comes from light from drops at a different position in the sky, radiated at the same angle. Local changes in the rain shower can affect the mirror rainbow completely differently from the   rainbow. There was more to that ‘reflection’ rainbow than met the eye, and there is more to a rainbow than the basic physics explanation, too. As the theory of rainbows has developed over history, more odd or unusual features were explained. Not only was the separation of colors understood, but so was the presence of secondary rainbows that display their colors in the opposite order these are caused by a double internal reflection within the raindrops. There is a darker band between the primary and secondary rainbows, known as “Alexander’s dark band” after Alexander of Aphrodisias, who observed it around 200 C. E. Alexander’s dark band lies at an angle forbidden by the optics of the simplest paths the light rays can travel along, making it darker than the rest of the sky. There are also rare “supernumerary arcs” that can appear within the arc of the main bow, caused by interference between two light rays coming to the eye at the same angle but traveling slightly different distances. All these features have been understood by developing Descartes’s original theory. The assumptions and approximations he made have been examined and refined, aided in recent years by increased computing power. Step by step, the details change and become more faithful to real life. You might think there is nothing left to learn about something so simple as a rainbow, but no —  the process continues and has even picked up pace, as the ubiquity of   digital cameras has yielded more and better images of startling, unusual rainbow features. One recent example is a newfound appreciation of the importance of different drop sizes and shapes. The original theory of rainbows assumes perfectly spherical raindrops, and does not depend on the size of the drops. In reality, larger raindrops are squished flatter on the underside by air resistance as they fall, developing a shape that rainbow enthusiasts call the “hamburger bun. ” Large drops usually make up a small fraction of a rain shower, but when they do contribute, calculations show that their oblateness leads to a change in the position of the top of the rainbow, while leaving the base unaffected. This is why the base of a rainbow often appears brighter than the top of the bow: all drop sizes contribute at the base, whereas near the top, light from the large,   drops is dispersed. Using precise numerical calculations, performed on   computers coded to describe the full scope of Maxwell’s equations of electromagnetism, increasingly esoteric features can be understood, and omissions and approximations in the theory can be fixed. That’s the way with science, whether we are talking about rainbows or   particle collisions. Finding a flaw doesn’t mean the theory is worthless, but it does mean that the theory can be improved. Scientists must avoid falling into the trap of defending all aspects of current thought because we feel the underlying truth needs protecting. Details of theory, or even broader aspects, can often be improved. Doing so strengthens the core of the theory —  that is, if it is fundamentally correct. If it isn’t, then we need a better theory as soon as possible. The most effective way to find a deeper description of nature is to seek more observations and to push the existing conception to breaking point. All of those thoughts were hovering along with the rainbow over the Helford River. Our understanding of rainbows is very robust now, but not complete. There are undoubtedly details that can still be improved. That walk home along the river, however, was definitely perfect. This article appears courtesy of Aeon Magazine. "
Trump Supporters on What Would Change Their Minds,Atlantic,Conor Friedersdorf,2017-01-03,"Last week, I explained how the Trump administration could exceed my expectations and asked Donald Trump supporters to lay down their own markers. What would it take for them to change their minds and stop supporting the president? The first batch of responses included two emails that stood out as particularly useful. Together, they illustrate political challenges that Trump will face as he tries to hold on to the very different sorts of supporters who form his coalition. Brendan, an immigration hawk from Colorado, represents one part of Trump’s base: I am a first time voter, 19, and Trump would have to back down on his campaign promises for me to not support him. I am already a bit nervous about some of his cabinet appointments, such as the Goldman Sachs bankers and the establishment neoconservatives like John Bolton he has chosen. I feel like the wall, and his strong   immigration stance, are his signature policy proposals, and he would have to cave to pressure from establishment   Republicans and betray his immigration policies he laid out in his AZ speech. His   policies and ideas are very important to my family and I as well. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, he has to appoint conservative,   SCOTUS judges. Really, for me it comes down to the immigration, trade, and SCOTUS issues. If he betrays any of those, or otherwise starts acting like another Bush or like Marco Rubio, or John McCain, or Lindsey Graham, I’ll feel betrayed. Trump can tweet as much as he wants though   …     to me it’s hilarious, even if not exactly presidential. You probably think the things I support about Trump are the worst things about him, but that’s exactly why most of my conservative family and I support him (I’m not popular in college). Since Reagan (and not even Reagan, to be honest) we haven’t had a GOP President actually follow through with    ideas that the base actually wants. The GOP base, and myself, never wanted “immigration reform,” we wanted less immigration, and not a hint of amnesty. We’ve never been for unlimited free trade, but for some reason politicians have always considered it sacred.  I don’t want compromise anymore, I want to win! Anyways, I just wanted to say what I think Trump’s core supporters, from the very beginning, will want Trump to do   …     it probably isn’t what the ’moderates’ RINOs and liberals want   …     sorry. Among other things, Brendan’s email is a reminder that   fault lines remain with us. (He’s mistaken, though, to say that Trump has named Bolton to a position in his administration.) Yes, Trump prevailed over Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, John Kasich, and Lindsey Graham in primaries. At the same time, he lost the popular vote and enters office with a historically low approval rating, while those rivals are or were popular elected officials in Florida, Texas, Ohio, and South Carolina. Figures like them are sprinkled throughout the Republican Senate. (John McCain is 80 and just won a   term. Surely Trump can’t threaten him.) Insofar as the    agenda and the agenda preferred by Trump’s base are irreconcilable, conflict is likely. Trump can probably finesse differences on judges. Immigration and   disagreements will prove harder to resolve. And Trump’s challenge is complicated by another sort of voter in his coalition, represented in the next reader email. Its author is Mike, who qualifies as a moderate. Mike began by explaining why he voted Trump: He believes that the press was going out of its way to prevent Trump from being elected that the women accusing him of sexual assault were lying to stop his candidacy and that Trump was falsely portrayed as racist. “He used to make all kinds of contributions to Al Sharpton’s charity, which went towards the African American community,” he wrote.  “He use to pal around with Jesse Jackson. He’s friends with Don King  Muhammad Ali, and Mike Tyson. .. Surprisingly enough, he voted for Obama in 2008, when he was a liberal or democrat, and made contributions to Hillary Clintons campaign. ” Mike voted for Barack Obama in  2008. In 2016, Mike was a Bernie Sanders supporter, “but since the DNC and the Clinton campaign screwed Bernie I couldn’t vote for him,” he explained, adding that what he saw as “dirty political tactics” by Clinton and the media cemented his vote. “I don’t think Trump is a Republican,” he said, “I think he is more liberal then people believe. I also think he wants to avoid a war with Russia, which is good. ” In fact, Mike’s account of what would make him stop supporting Trump includes a whole lot of policies that many Republican members of Congress would love to see enacted: What would make me change my mind about Trump? That would be a big no for me. ( I don’t worry about Obamacare, the truly needy have state run Medicaid programs  however I have nothing against it either. I hope he changes what is bad about it and keeps what is good like he has discussed.) This sort of Trump supporter is familiar to any reporter who wandered America conversing with voters, but a lot of people in blue enclaves can hardly conceive that they exist. Mike concluded: My main worries are for Social Security, the disabled, elderly, and people in our country that are vulnerable and require some kind of government assistance. If he does anything that really impacts this group of people that would definitely be enough for me to vote against Trump in 2020 . I want to give him a chance, let’s see what he does in these 4 years . He could really surprise everyone. I think Trump is better then getting Ted Cruz, who is actually a radical Republican conservative. Whereas Trump has a lot of   ideas. Trump was the only Republican I voted for this election. The rest of my votes went to state Democrats.  I am a bit concerned that he has a Republican House and Senate, which makes it a lot easier for Republicans to push some radical conservative agenda through. And Trump may be pressured to help them with that since he ran under their party. The Supreme Court picks will have me a bit concerned. I think Trump is more   and he is surrounded by a lot of radical conservatives, even some he has chosen in his cabinet picks. Hopefully, he sticks to the positive change that he talked about and doesn’t let these Republicans dictate his presidency. If I see some far right agenda being pushed I will definitely vote the other way next time around . Holding on to Brendan or Mike four years from now poses tough challenges for President Trump. Holding onto both sorts of voters without losing large swaths of the conservative movement would require extraordinary political finesse. How Trump attempts to keep his coalition together may determine his 2020 primary challenger. Current Trump supporters with their own ideas about what would change their minds are still encouraged to email conor@theatlantic. com, especially if your views depart from those of Brendan and Mike. I thank them for the time and effort it took to write."
How University Costs Keep Rising Despite Tuition Freezes,Atlantic,Jon Marcus ,2017-01-03,"DAYTON, Ohio —  At a time when public anger is   on tuition charges that are rising three times faster than inflation, something less well understood has actually been largely responsible for pushing up the cost of college: fees. Think tuition is high? Now add fees for student activities, fees for athletics, fees for building maintenance, fees for libraries —  even fees for graduation, the bills for which often arrive just as students and their families thought they were finally done paying for their higher education. All are frustratingly piled on top of a long list of expenses beyond tuition that many people never plan for or expect, or that can’t be covered by financial aid —  sometimes forcing them to take out more and more loans, or quit college altogether.  “It was, like, what is this?” Ann Roach remembered thinking as she kept getting billed for fees when her oldest son went to the University of Dayton. “It’s like buying a car. You think you have a price, and then they tell you, ‘Here’s a conveyance fee, or here’s a fee for $200 to put the license plates on.’ Nobody told us about these. ” Fees nationwide continue to increase even faster than tuition —  often covering the same things but letting institutions claim tuition hikes are slowing. Now, however, in response to anger from parents and students, and pressure from legislatures, or for marketing reasons in a time when they’re struggling to attract applicants, a few universities and colleges are pledging to make them more predictable or even drop them altogether. And the resulting decline in borrowing and dropout rates on those campuses suggest the significant toll that fees were taking on their students. Since the time that Roach’s son went to Dayton, for instance —  he graduated in 2012, to be followed by two younger siblings —  the school has stopped charging separate fees and rolled them into tuition, which it guarantees it won’t increase for the four years an accepted applicant remains enrolled. The university was surprised to find that graduating students, in a survey, said they were “feeling  ” said Jason Reinoehl, Dayton’s vice president for strategic enrollment management. “Frankly they were ticked off, and they were saying this on the way out of college, which should have been a celebratory time. ” That’s because those graduates had been charged $2, 100 annually in fees, on average, in five different bills per year, or at least 20 times per student over the course of their four years in college. Those fees included everything from counseling fees to lab fees to   fees to access to the recreation complex to a “  fee” in the school of business that turned out to pay for a subscription to The Wall Street Journal. “This was why students were annoyed, and we needed to fix it,” Reinoehl said. The fees weren’t necessarily lowered, but since 2013 they have been included in the tuition charge ($26, 590 this year) meaning more of them can be covered by financial aid and all are paid up front. This also encourages the university to hold the line on annual increases, which can no longer be partly hidden in fees. “There are no surprises here,” pronounces a message splashed across the binder in which applicants receive information about how much the university will cost them to attend. The first students who were eligible for the program will graduate this spring, and the university says they have already had to borrow at least 15 percent less toward their degrees. Dropout rates have also fallen. So has the proportion of admitted applicants who fail to show up for their freshman year in September after getting their first bill. Fees still add up to plenty of surprises for students and their families on other campuses, however. One reason is that they’re hard to track. There are few sources of information on how much fees actually cost, on average. “Tuition gets all of the media attention while fees are hidden to students and also to public knowledge and oversight,” said Jennifer Delaney, an associate professor at the University of Illinois at   who specializes in   finance. Those that are reported tend to be mandatory fees, not the growing number of   supplemental fees charged by individual courses or departments, such as lab fees and that   fee at the University of Dayton business school. One new study calculates that student fees at   public universities averaged $1, 719 in the   school year, the most recent for which the figure is available, adding another 27 percent to student charges on top of the typical cost of tuition. Fees have also been increasing far faster than tuition, nearly doubling at   public universities and more than doubling at community colleges since   according to that study, by Robert Kelchen, an assistant professor of education at Seton Hall University. “We’ve all seen the proliferation of these, with multiple fees, multiple program fees, and multiple course fees,” said Eric Spina, the president of the University of Dayton. Other universities, he said, tell their students, “‘Don’t worry about the extra $400.’ Well, the $400 three years ago was $50. ” Students at public universities in Connecticut, New Jersey, South Dakota, and Virginia were charged $2, 500 or more in fees per year, and in Massachusetts, $8, 280, Kelchen reported —  nearly five times the cost of tuition in that state. Separate research at the University of Missouri found that students nationwide were being charged such things as   fees,   fees,   and   fees,   and   fees, bicycle   fees, campus   fees, “ ” fees,   fees, safety fees,   fees and, at one university, a “    fee. ” Athletics fees are particularly contentious. Athletic departments at Division 1 universities and colleges got an average annual subsidy of between $3. 5 million and $4. 2 million per school from student fees in 2011, according to the Center for College Affordability and Productivity. By dividing the athletic fee per student at Ohio University by the number of varsity athletic events the average student reported attending, the center found that each student there was paying $130 for each game he or she actually attended. To make things worse, fees often increase with each successive year a student is in college, in the form of such things as lab or studio fees added to the cost of increasingly advanced courses in many majors. The only way to avoid them by that point is to drop out or transfer, risking the loss of academic credits. If some of these fees sound like they’re covering exactly the same things tuition is supposed to —  the University of Missouri study found, at various institutions,   fees,   and   fees, education   fees, educational and technology fees, educational   fees, and   fees —  they are. Many have been added to make up for state budget cuts, to avoid making tuition look like it’s rising too quickly, or because legislatures have ordered that tuition be frozen. In Missouri, for example, where public universities were stopped by law from raising tuition faster than inflation, schools instead increased their fees by 138 percent over six years, an investigation by the state auditor found. “But they held the line on tuition,” Kelchen said wryly. In Massachusetts, public universities had to return their revenue from tuition to the state but got to keep the money they made from fees the result was that tuition didn’t increase, but fees skyrocketed. Georgia’s Board of Regents added a $100 “  fee” in 2009 when state funding was cut near the start of the recession. But while the funding has rebounded, the fee remains, and has increased to $450. “It really does seem like a semantic thing, that it’s just another word for tuition,” Delaney said. One result is that     scholarships might sound as if they cover the whole cost of college, but often fall short, since they don’t include fees. A merit scholarship for full tuition to public universities in Massachusetts, for example, left students to come up on their own with what was then nearly $8, 000 a year worth of fees, a Harvard study found. That further complicates the already difficult struggle to pay for a degree. “A focus on affordability that doesn’t include predictability is really hard on students and parents,” said Delaney. Or, as Spina put it, universities should “be right up front and tell our students: This is what you get for this price. ” A resulting backlash has a few institutions making changes, and some legislatures ordering them to. After student complaints, the University of Kansas has reduced its athletics fee from $50 to $12 a year. The Virginia General Assembly has directed that, beginning this year, universities there reduce their reliance on student fees to support intercollegiate athletics the legislation specifically limits Old Dominion University to using student fees for 55 percent or less of its athletics budget. Old Dominion students in   paid $1, 429 each in athletics fees alone, accounting for 65 percent of the athletics budget. The Massachusetts Legislature has approved a change that lets the public universities there hold onto revenue from their own tuition. In response, starting next fall, the universities will wrap together tuition and most   fees in a single charge on a simplified bill. And at the University of Iowa, eight different fees charged by the registrar’s office —  including transcript fees,   fees, and fees to add or drop courses —  were consolidated in the fall into one $225 fee. That’s $25 less than they previously cost separately. But the main reason for the change, said the registrar, Larry Lockwood, was to help students manage their budgets by making sure they knew what charges to expect. “We had to take control of this,” Lockwood said. One of those fees was a $100 graduation charge that Iowa, like many universities, makes its students pay before they don caps and gowns and walk across the stage to pick up their degrees. “How would you like to have to pay one more fee just as you’re about to graduate?” Lockwood asked. Among other things, the change is expected to save the university money it used to spend chasing after fees. The University of Dayton, too, says it will end up saving money, not only by avoiding having to send out 40, 000 separate bills per year for student fees, but by not having to go through the costly process of replacing students who quit school because they couldn’t afford to pay the fees. It’s also an important selling point for the private Catholic university, which after a brief dip when students and their parents seemed confused about the changes, has seen a surge of applications and an increase in enrollment. “This is very much about building trust,” said Dayton’s Reinoehl. “It’s our beacon. I think the whole industry is going to have to do this. ” He said other schools have called to learn more about the new way the University of Dayton bundles its charges. For now, however, Reinoehl said, in much of the rest of higher education, there remains “a trend to charge more fees, not fewer. ” Students on the campus outside his window count themselves among the few American college and university students who live in blissful innocence of that. One, Laylah Funk, said her friends at other schools “were blown away when I told them we don’t have to pay for health services or counseling. ” Renee Brown, who has two siblings at other colleges, said they’re constantly being hit with fees. “You think you’ve paid for everything and then some fee comes up out of nowhere,” Brown said. Studying in a quiet corner of the library on a frigid Ohio morning,   major Ryan Berry was asked what it’s like to not have to pay for all of those fees his counterparts at most other colleges and universities face. Berry responded with a quizzical look. “I didn’t know that was actually a thing,” he said. This post appears courtesy of The Hechinger Report."
Tweeting Mao’s Cultural Revolution in Real-Time ,Atlantic,Sarah Zhang,2017-01-03,"Can we agree on this much? Twitter was terrible in 2016. Too many tweetstorms, too many Russian   too much game theory. For the blank slate of 2017, may I suggest you follow the   anniversary of the Cultural Revolution in real time. Fifty years ago this past May, Mao Zedong declared the beginning of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and in 2016, someone had the idea to livetweet that tumultuous period on a   delay. @GPCR50 has about 1, 500 followers, which is frankly on the low end of modest. But I’ve been one of its avid followers because this was an uncanny year to see the events of the Cultural Revolution swirled together with the 2016 election in my feed. Violence simmered over at Trump rallies. Red Guards attacked their teachers in Beijing. Deng Xiaoping made   in deference to Mao. Newt Gingrich declares “I made a big boo boo” in suggesting Trump did not plan to drain the swamp. The surreal past met the surreal present. Anyways, I don’t want to draw tidy parallels between the Cultural Revolution and America in 2016 because, obviously, so much does not run parallel. But in a time when voters have shown casual eagerness to blow up a system that isn’t working for them, at at time when Trump can ask, “What do you have to lose? ,” @GPCR50 was a daily reminder by tweet of just how much we have to lose. We’ve had relative order and stability for so long. Chaos is a foreign country. I confess to being no expert either here. As a kid, most of my awareness of the Cultural Revolution came from stories from my parents, who were born in China around that time. And like the fairy tales a parent might tell, these stories had a kind of unlogic they seemed no more real to me than a fairy tale. A man, for example, rides home with a portrait of Chairman Mao tied up to the back of his bike. The rope holding the portrait in place just happens to go across Mao’s neck. This is a sign of disloyalty. He is mobbed and killed. What the hell? Yet @GPCR was a constant stream of   violence. Mao directed the Red Guards, which grew out of   students in Beijing, to attack the “Four Olds” —  old customs, old culture, old habits, and old ideas. In effect, this meant the destruction of books, museums, temples, and shrines, as well as the people who stood for them.   students turned on their teachers and killed them.    Middle school Red Guards beat Vice Principal Bian Zhongyun with   clubs. She passes out and is dumped in a rubbish cart.    Daxing’s local brigade buries undesirables alive. ”Granny, I’m getting sand in my eyes” says a girl aged 8. ”Soon you won’t feel it”.    Red Guards resort to using dynamite to open Confucius’ tomb. But when they peer into the crater, nothing discernibly human is left. And for a certain period in August, the @GPCR50 was just death count:    Red Guards killed 200 people in Beijing today.    Red Guards killed 224 people in Beijing today. The man behind @GPCR50 is Jacob Saxton of Southampon, U. K. whom I phoned one recent afternoon to talk about his Twitter creation. Saxton is a not a historian —  he is a logistics analyst by day —  but he has an interest in modern Chinese history and was reading Mao’s Last Revolution last year. He noticed the 50 years that passed and no one else was chronicling the period. So he decided to. The one book soon grew to a stack, and Saxton now plans out tweets month by month in a “sort of slightly shoddy Excel spreadsheet. ” In August, when the   violence was reaching its peak, he had to take a few days off work to catch up on the tweets. “It’s a lot more time than I realized at the beginning,” he says. Some of the tweets can, admittedly, be a bit abstruse if you are not already familiar with the cast of characters. But the best tweets capture some small measure of humanity. One of Saxton’s favorite stories involves a fruit basket, which he actually didn’t get to tweet in real time because he read about it too late. (A hazard of his   process.) I’ll let him tell it himself now: Right at the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, Mao got rid of Peng Zhen, who was the mayor of Beijing.  He was quite close to Liu Shaoqi, the president. Liu went out on a big foreign trip during the time when the purge of Peng Zhen was happening, and he was so in the dark about this —  the way Peng had gone from the mayor of Beijing, this really important guy, to pariah —  he came back with a beautiful fruit basket for Peng. Only on the last leg of the journey did he found out how much things have changed. It’s quite a funny image to imagine him trying to hide this fruit basket. In tweeting out these events in real time, Saxton has also gotten to experience them in real time. “I thought the saddest bit were the way you could see this violence creeping towards people —  people who you might read about having died on a certain day in the Cultural Revolution,” he says. “But then you look more into it, there are weeks of it gradually ramping up, and the attacks get more physical and their own mental state chipped away. ” When Saxton began the Twitter account, he had no idea that it would be such a tumultuous year for politics in his country, the U. K. let alone the U. S. He is wary of drawing close parallels too, but he says it struck him how long it took China’s political elite to realize how bad the Cultural Revolution would get.   It can get worse. The Cultural Revolution officially ends in 1976. For now, Saxon says, he’s committed to tweeting the whole thing."
Why Trump’s Conflicts of Interest Matter,Atlantic,Olga Khazan,2017-01-03,"  Donald Trump has announced he’s closing his foundation, but that doesn’t put an end to the tangle of potential conflicts of interest he will drag with him into the oval office. To name just a few examples, Trump runs a vineyard that awaits   visas —  documents doled out by a department he will soon oversee. He is currently trying to build a   office building in Buenos Aires, something the journalist Jorge Lanata said Trump discussed with Argentine president Mauricio Macri during his first phone call with him as  . (Both Macri and Trump have denied this discussion.) Trump even told the New York Times in late November that his “brand is certainly a hotter brand than it was before. ” Trump’s complicated network of business ties worry ethics watchdogs, who say it should not even be possible for an American president to be swayed by the prospect of personal riches. “He might decide to go softly on a foreign government because he knows he has assets there,” said Lisa Gilbert, director of the Congress Watch division at Public Citizen. “He can’t even have that in the back of his mind. The American economy has to outweigh any personal financial benefits. ” Trump, meanwhile, has maintained that he won’t be bothered by the conflicts, telling the Times first, that “the president can’t have a conflict of interest,” then that “the president of the United States is allowed to have whatever conflicts he wants. ” “In theory,” he suggested to the paper’s writers and editors, “I could run my business perfectly and then run the country perfectly. ” The reason critics doubt Trump’s assertion —  that he’s somehow above the lure of profit —  is that years of research show even small kickbacks can change   individuals’ behavior. We know this from studies on another group of wealthy, confident individuals who must daily grapple with both moral and economic matters: Doctors. Studies have repeatedly shown that receiving gifts or money from a pharmaceutical company makes doctors biased toward that company. A comprehensive review in 2010 found that exposure to information from pharmaceutical companies almost always influenced doctors to increase their prescribing of the drugs the companies were promoting, even when those drugs were less appropriate for the patient. In a study published this month in the journal Social Science  Medicine, Yale professor Marissa King found that in states that banned gifts to doctors from pharmaceutical companies, doctors were less likely to prescribe costly new medications that had few advantages over cheaper, generic alternatives. “Pharmaceutical representatives are likable people, and we like doing things to please people that we like,” says Peter Mansfield, an Australian physician who founded the   group HealthySkepticism. org and   the 2010 review paper. Partly in response to findings like these, some states and organizations have cracked down on pharmaceutical swag in recent years. Still, doctors aren’t free of conflicts of interest, since drug companies still fund continuing medical education programs and seek out consulting relationships with physicians, according to Genevieve   a senior fellow researching conflicts of interest at the University of Pennsylvania. Even cheap gifts can create a feeling of indebtedness, playing into our human desire to reciprocate. Branded pens or tchotchkes “make the brand name more easily retrievable from memory and cognitively ease the path for doctors to prescribe more of that particular brand,”   said. Medical students given a Lipitor clipboard were more likely to prefer it over a generic cholesterol drug. As Mansfield explains, “if you do something after getting a big gift, you can tell yourself you did that because of the gift. If you did something because of a small gift, your understanding is that you did it because you believed the person. ” Trump’s assertion that he will be able to separate his personal interest from the greater good is also not uncommon —  and generally, false. “People have a ‘bias blind spot,’” says King, the Yale professor, “and are more likely to see bias in others than in themselves. ” In a 1992 study, doctors were treated to   trips to seminars held at luxury resorts on the West Coast, Florida, and the Caribbean by makers of an antibiotic and heart drug. When interviewed by the study authors, almost all the doctors said there’s no way they would be influenced by the vacations. But the doctors’ use of both drugs shot up after they returned home. Similarly, medical residents were much more likely to think other doctors are influenced by swag and   lunches than they themselves would be. “We pick up an infection of bias,” Mansfield said, but “we get offended if someone says we might be carrying a bias. ” In fact, people who are more confident about their ability to resist influence tend to make decisions more quickly, Mansfield said, and that process “can be influenced by gifts and other triggers for    . ” So will Trump fall into the same trap that doctors have?   believes he might, since unlike physicians, politicians have no board certification or formal professional guild that governs their ethical code. “On the other hand, politicians may very well become inured to or savvy about attempts to influence them and therefore be less amenable to influence,” she added. But Mansfield thinks Trump’s no different from a psychiatrist scribbling with a Vyvanse pen. “To the extent that Trump is human, he’ll be influenced by conflicts of interest,” Mansfield said. “Perhaps even more so if he sees them as being small and if he’s genuinely confident he won’t be influenced. ” Trump has previously said he would put his children in charge of his businesses, but that would hardly a true blind trust, since his children would likely discuss the businesses with their father. (So far, they’ve been some of his closest advisers.) Ideally, in Public Citizens’ view, Trump’s assets would be placed in the hands of impartial overseers who would sell them off, one by one. Trump has so far postponed a press conference at which he was expected to announce how he would handle his conflicts of interest. If he doesn’t divest, even if he does manage to build a mental wall between his personal interests and those of the nation, the public will have no way of knowing. And as Gilbert sees it, that might be a problem in itself. As president, she says, “you should be free of the whisper of impropriety. It’s not that it might enrich him, it’s that people will think that it could. It’s an appearance of corruption that we’ve been above, as the United States. ” Time will tell if the U. S. will continue to be an exception to that rule."
A Long-Lost Data Trove Uncovers California’s Sterilization Program,Atlantic,Sarah Zhang,2017-01-03,"In 2007, only after historian Alexandra Minna Stern had spent years researching eugenics in the American west, culminating in a published book, did she find the motherlode. During the height of the eugenics movement, California sterilized 20, 000 patients deemed   or insane. Stern, who is a professor at the University of Michigan, wrote about the sterilization program in her book, but she had only a patchwork of records to work with. One day in 2007, a secretary pointed her toward a neglected filing cabinet at the state department of mental health’s office in Sacramento. Inside were 19 reels of coiled microfilm, containing sterilization recommendation forms with the names, ages, family histories, and diagnoses of nearly 20, 000 patients. These forgotten records covered patients recommended for sterilization at California state hospitals from 1919 to 1952. “The microfilm was in very good shape,” says Stern. “I don’t think anyone had looked at it since the 70s. ” Recognizing the value of such a complete record, Stern had the microfilm duplicated. (Good thing because the original microfilm was later lost when the department reorganized following California’s budget cuts.) From there, the project morphed into something resembling contemporary data science more than traditional historical research. Stern hired a team of students to turn microfilm into a searchable database of health records —  powered by   clinical trial software. And along the way, the team encountered the promises and pitfalls of big data as applied to history. Recently, Stern   a paper estimating that as many as 831 of the patients sterilized are still alive. The paper, she hopes, will spark conversations about compensating those forcibly sterilized, like North Carolina and Virginia have done. Until now, such a conversation had not happened in California. Because to compensate people, you have to first know who they are. * * * California became the third state to pass a sterilization law in 1909. The law allowed superintendents at state psychiatric institutions to sterilize patients to improve their “physical, mental, or moral condition. ” The wording was vague, and it could be applied to patients considered mentally ill, handicapped, sexually deviant, criminal —  anyone considered a misfit, really. Sterilization would prevent these undesirable people from having children. As a kid growing up in California, Stern recalls these state institutions being evoked in schoolyard taunts —  like “Oh you’re weird, you’ll end up in Napa,” referring to Napa State Hospital. The institutions performed vasectomies on men and salpingectomies, or the removal of Fallopian tubes in women. The 20, 000 people sterilized in California account for   of all such sterilizations in the U. S. Here are some of their stories, as previously written by Stern: In 1943, a      boy we will call Roberto was committed to the Sonoma State Home, an institution for the “feebleminded” in Northern California. Roberto’s journey to Sonoma began the previous year when he was picked up by the Santa Barbara Police for a string of infractions that included intoxication, a knife fight, and involvement with a “local gang of marauding Mexicans. ” Citing his record of delinquency and “borderline” IQ score of 75, the officials at Sonoma recommended that Roberto be sterilized. Roberto’s father adamantly, and unsuccessfully, opposed his son’s sterilization, and went so far as to secure a priest to protest the operation. Or the story of a young   woman: Silvia, a   mother of a toddler, was 20 years old when she was placed in Pacific Colony in 1950. She was assessed with an “imbecile” IQ of 35 and reportedly had been raised in a violent home. Silvia’s mother ostensibly could not control her daughter and approved her sterilization. Or that of a young, possibly gay, man: Fifteen years earlier, Timothy, a white   old placed in Stockton because of   encounters since boyhood and a psychiatric diagnosis of “dementia praecox, hebephrenic type,” consented to his own reproductive surgery, perhaps because he knew that it was a potential ticket out of the facility or because he felt it would help him control his pathologized sexual desires. These are individual stories, but Stern wanted to construct the database to find larger patterns. And of the foremost questions she wanted to ask was whether Hispanic patients were treated any differently in these institutions. The first step, just building a database, was no trivial task. The 20, 000 records each contained 212 individual variables. “Imagine you put all that in Excel spreadsheet. It’s going to be a mind boggling mess,” says Stern. Since they were working with health records, they also needed to be in compliance with HIPAA. Stern’s then graduate student Natalie Lira, now a professor of   studies at the University of Illinois   headed up that effort. She ended up collaborating with   from University of Michigan’s School of Public Health to use Redcap, a data capture tool typical in clinical trials. Over three years, a team of undergraduate and graduate students entered the data off of the microfilm into a searchable database. Asking the question of who is Hispanic turned out to be complicated too. The forms did not have a line for ethnicity instead, they asked for “nativity,” where someone was originally born. A man of Mexican descent could be born in California, so nativity would not correlate with what we currently think of as Hispanic. When Nicole Novak, an epidemiologist who also worked on the project, went to look for census data on Hispanics living in California, she encountered more confusion. Mexicans, for example, where considered their own race in 1930, white in 1940 and after, though states in the Southwest had their own category for “white person of Spanish surname. ” Looking at historic records, says Novak, “has shed a lot of light on how constructed a lot of categories we use in public health are. ” The team ended up using Spanish surnames as a proxy for Hispanic ethnicity, despite the imperfect correlation. (Filipinos, for example, also have Spanish surnames.) Eventually, they found that patients with Spanish surnames were indeed     times as likely to be sterilized than those without. The “nativity” classification posed another question. Should the team use the original outdated terminology on the forms or attempt to update them to our modern language? “Do you use ‘dementia praecox,’ which is roughly equivalent to schizophrenia today? Do you use the word ‘Negro? ’” says Stern. In the end, they ended up using the original terms. As a historian, Stern is very much aware of the pitfalls of using interpreting the past through a modern lens. “One can be seduced by big data,” she says. “ You have to precede with caution. ” To use this database is to interpret variables set a century ago. These issues are on Stern’s mind now because the team is working to make the database available to other researchers. It also requires a delicate balance of privacy. Many of the records are now old enough that they are publicly available in California’s state archives in Sacramento. (The microfilm is the state archives is actually the duplicate set Stern made because, remember, the originals were lost.) But is that the same thing as putting them online for anyone to search? Especially if hundreds of these patients, as the recent paper suggests, are still alive? Stern’s team, too, has had to balance their desires to learn more with the wishes of the people whose lives they are studying. The records are wealth of intimate information. And despite analyzing the data on a macro level —  831 survivors is a statistical estimate based on age —  they haven’t gone looking for them individually. As a researcher, says Lira, “Ethically, it feels wrong to look at someone’s medical records and try to reach out and contact them. ” Stern says she has heard from family members of sterilized patients, who reached out after learning about her research. In one case, she also managed to track down the sister of a woman who had been sterilized and later filed a lawsuit. The sister called Stern back but said she didn’t want to talk anymore because the past was too painful. Ideally, says Stern, the state of California would take on the task of finding these patients and compensating them. “It’s more present in my mind now, that there’s a story for every single data point,” says Novak, who as an epidemiologists usually works with statistics. That filing cabinet in Sacramento held 20, 000 forgotten stories, now with 20, 000 names to go with them."
The GOP’s Ethics Disaster,Atlantic,Norm Ornstein,2017-01-03,"I have rarely been more angry or dismayed at the conduct of Congress than I was Monday night with the unconscionable, deplorable, underhanded move by Representative Bob Goodlatte to eviscerate and undermine the Office of Congressional Ethics. When House Speaker Paul Ryan and his counterpart Nancy Pelosi indicated weeks ago that they would continue OCE, the reform community —  left and right —  breathed a sigh of relief. Ryan, like his predecessor John Boehner, had seen the value to the integrity of the House of the office, which has been a stalwart of bipartisan and nonpartisan comity and independence. That makes this    action even more outrageous. In March 2008, the House of Representatives did something striking, stirring, unprecedented, and edifying. It voted to create for the first time an independent office to deal with congressional ethics. I was both exultant and relieved at the time. I had seen up close for decades the difficulty inherent in a body tasked with policing itself. It is built into the Constitution that each house of Congress judge the conduct of its individual members. But the way in which this happened in practice, via a Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, had rarely worked either to make standards crystal clear to members and staff or to inspire public confidence in the body. For more than two decades, I had pushed to create an independent office, with involvement from former members who understand the nature of ethics in a political body, to be the first step in judging the conduct of members. The Atlantic  Politics  Policy Daily: Congress Clocks In, The problem was built into the system. Having members of a political and partisan body pass judgment on their colleagues has inherent conflicts. Fail to act when wrongdoing is apparent? The   network is protecting its own, proving the corruption of politics.  Take tough action or bring controversial charges? That can reflect partisan motives or revenge, or the ambitions of members of the ethics panel taking out rivals for power. Clouds of suspicion hang over the process. Those conflicts are true in the best of times even when the members of the ethics panel act together in good faith, skepticism is inevitable. But the years leading up to 2008 were anything but the best of times. First came the ethics wars, led by Newt Gingrich in the years leading up to 1994, using the ethics process for partisan leverage, criminalizing policy differences. After Gingrich became speaker, the backlash hit him directly, in a tit for tat. Under Speaker Dennis Hastert and his henchman Tom DeLay, it got worse. The nadir came in 2004 when an honest ethics panel, chaired by conservative Republican Joel Hefley of Colorado did its duty and recommended sanctions against DeLay for unethical conduct. Hastert responded by firing Hefley and removing two standup Republican members, Kenny Hulshof of Missouri and the late Steve LaTourette of Ohio. When Democrats recaptured the House in 2006, the new speaker, Nancy Pelosi, began a process to clean the House, choosing Massachusetts Democrat Michael Capuano to lead the effort via a bipartisan select panel.  Through a lengthy, arduous process, with deep opposition from nearly all Republicans and real reluctance on the part of many Democrats, Capuano, working closely with me and Tom Mann and a small group of other reformers, pieced together a balanced plan that respected and preserved the constitutional requirement that the House be the judge of its own members, kept intact the ethics committee, but created a way to build larger credibility that the ethics process would be honest and fair whatever the political currents or partisan pressures. It was weaker than we had hoped —  it had no subpoena power, even indirectly via the ethics committee —  but it was still a major breakthrough. The OCE would never have made it over the finish line if it were not for Pelosi (and the respect Capuano had among his colleagues.) But while it passed on a   line vote, it would have been neutered quickly if it were not for the willingness of Republican Leader John Boehner to pick strong members for the first office.  It was the initial cast of members who kept OCE on course despite opposition from the members of the ethics committee and the wariness of a large group of lawmakers. David Skaggs and Porter Goss were the first leaders, and were exemplary, as were their colleagues, including other former members (Bill Frenzel and Ab Mikva, may they rest in peace, along with Yvonne Burke and Karan English, and two others who had deep experience around Congress, Jay Eagan and Allison Hayward. The OCE members spanned the political spectrum, and had a thankless task, but responded just the way we had hoped —  every decision they made was balanced, careful, and importantly, unanimous. The body took plenty of potshots, from aggrieved members of both parties, which have continued since its creation.  Reformers have feared at the beginning of each Congress since then that the leadership would try to remove it or weaken it. But Pelosi stood firm and Boehner, to his great credit, did so as well. Now this. Rules packages get up or down votes, and are top priority for the majority leadership. They are not rejected by the majority party. The package is put together by the leadership nothing gets included or excluded without the   of the speaker. Make no mistake about it: Despite public reports loudly proclaiming his opposition, it’s hard to believe this would have happened had Paul Ryan really tried to stop it. And do not believe Goodlatte’s risable assurance that this strengthens OCE. It has been muzzled and hamstrung, defenestrated and castrated. If Speaker Ryan really is opposed, he can demand a separate vote on the OCE provision when the whole House votes on its rules. If he does not, he owns it, plain and simple. Given Ryan’s solidarity with   Trump on Russian hacking —  preceded by his   any bipartisan statement during the campaign warning against foreign attempts to influence our elections —  along with Government Reform Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz’s indifference to any investigation of conflicts of interest or ethical problems with the   and his cronies, this is chilling evidence that we are headed for a new age of official embrace or at least acceptance of unethical and illegal behavior. The core of America’s political system depends on real checks and balances, on a Congress that puts country ahead of party. The House leadership showed this week that party comes first. "
A President Without an Administration,Atlantic,Russell Berman,2017-01-03,"  Donald Trump will take the reins of the federal government on January 20. How many people he will have by his side on that date is very much in question. The Trump transition is substantially behind the pace set eight years ago by Barack Obama’s team, and a late start to vetting Cabinet nominees for security clearances and financial conflicts of interest threatens to leave many senior posts vacant when Trump assumes the presidency in just     weeks. The delays, which were described by people familiar with the transition as well as several congressional aides, could hamper the new president’s ability to deliver the swift change he has promised in Washington. In the weeks after the election, Trump made a show of naming members of his Cabinet in rapid succession, giving the impression that his transition was proceeding speedily, faster even than many people expected after such a shocking result on November 8. But the slew of nominations obscured an important detail: Trump’s team had done little or no vetting of those appointees before or immediately after the election, as the Obama transition had done. Potential picks were rarely asked to submit information for a standard FBI background check or financial documents needed for disclosure requirements and an ethics agreement. That meant that a process that takes weeks or even months did not begin until late November or December in some cases. The Donald Trump Cabinet Tracker, And for Trump, there’s another complication: His Cabinet is stacked with wealthy executives whose vast and complex financial portfolios must be combed for potential business conflicts and then untangled before they receive Senate confirmation hearings. They include Rex Tillerson, the Exxon Mobil CEO nominated to be secretary of state Steve Mnuchin for treasury secretary Andrew Puzder for labor secretary Wilbur Ross for commerce secretary and Betsy DeVos as education secretary. “With these billionaires, it’s going to take a lot more time,” said Richard Painter, who served as the chief ethics lawyer in the Bush White House from 2005 to 2007. Painter recalled that when he joined the government 12 years ago, it took him half a day to fill out the initial financial disclosure form. “But,” he said, “I was just a law professor.  I have mutual funds. I don’t even own any individual stocks, and it’s really a pretty boring report. ” By comparison, when Painter helped shepherd Hank Paulson to confirmation as treasury secretary in 2006, it took the Goldman Sachs CEO and a team of pricey outside lawyers     weeks to complete the same form. The task of vetting and then preparing ethics agreements for Trump’s nominees now falls to the Office of Government Ethics, a relatively small federal agency with about 80 employees and an annual budget of $16 million. The office reviews each nominee’s financial disclosure report for potential conflicts of interest and then instructs them what assets they must unload, among other steps they may have to take, to comply with the law once they take office. The result is a signed agreement that is sent to the Senate and posted publicly. Tillerson, for example, is expected to have to divest himself completely from Exxon Mobil, including forgoing any stock options to which he may be entitled. While the office has been preparing for the presidential transition for months, it is likely to struggle to complete work for Trump’s Cabinet in time for them all to be in place by inauguration. “It’s a huge challenge for the office. Huge challenge,” Painter said. “They need more funding. ” (The OGE, despite a   flurry of tweets directed at Trump, does not comment on individual reports, which are made public only when they are complete.) By this time eight years ago, several of Obama’s Cabinet picks had signed ethics agreements, said Norman Eisen, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who served as the president’s ethics lawyer during the transition and his first years in the White House. None of Trump’s nominees have them yet. “They are behind,” Eisen said. With a   Democratic majority in 2009, the Senate confirmed six members of Obama’s Cabinet on the day he was inaugurated and another four within the next week. Republicans control the chamber now, and they want to have a similar number of Trump nominees in place when he takes office. Democrats, however, are worried that Republican leaders will try to rush through several nominees whose thin public record and thicket of potential financial entanglements deserve more time for scrutiny. Last month, the senior Democrats on 16 Senate committees demanded that no Trump nominee should receive a confirmation hearing until he or she has cleared an FBI background check, submitted a signed ethics agreement, and answered   questions from committee members. Because of a rules change engineered by Democrats in 2013, the 52 Senate Republicans can confirm Trump’s nominees without Democratic votes, and a few committee chairmen have already set tentative hearing dates for the second and third week of January without receiving the completed paperwork for the nominees. “There is no indication that the schedule for hearings is going to be ticked back as a result of this slower pace,” a senior Senate Democratic aide said. While Democrats can’t block the nominees outright without GOP defections, they can use parliamentary tactics to slow down the process and turn the Senate into even more of a bottleneck than it already is. In some cases they could delay confirmation hearings for nominees, or they could force the Senate to spend days debating each candidate on the floor —  a move that would not only keep top Cabinet offices vacant but prevent Republicans from moving quickly to passage of Trump’s legislative agenda. Senator Charles Schumer of New York, the new Democratic leader, warned that his members would “vehemently resist” any GOP effort to rush Cabinet nominees into office without proper hearings or before their financial disclosure and ethics agreements were complete. “If Republicans think they can quickly jam through a whole slate of nominees without a fair hearing process, they’re sorely mistaken,” Schumer said in a statement. The other fear among some Democrats in and out of government is that with the help of a compliant Republican Congress, Trump’s Cabinet nominees will simply follow the example of their   boss when it comes to ethics. The   never released his tax returns during the campaign, and he has refused to fully divest from his businesses before taking office. Yet while the specifics ethics law that applies to government employees does not apply to the president, his appointees would be putting themselves in enormous legal jeopardy if they took office without resolving potential conflicts of interest. “They commit a criminal offense,” Painter said. “That doesn’t apply to the president and vice president, but they commit a criminal offense. The people working for him are going to have to play by the rules. ” Republican chairmen say Democrats are overstating the delays and that they intend to follow Senate precedents in processing nominees, which vary by committee. Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, has rejected demands from Democrats, for example, that the committee ask Tillerson to provide his tax returns, since it has not done so for past nominees. But he said Tillerson would not receive special treatment or exemptions from the traditional requirements. “Prior to his confirmation hearing, he will go through the same ethics and FBI checks as previous Secretary of State nominees,” Corker said. “That has always been the plan, it is already in progress, and I am deeply disappointed my colleagues continue to imply otherwise. Our committee will carry out exactly the same procedures for Mr. Tillerson’s nomination that have been carried out since well before I joined the committee 10 years ago. ” Similarly, Republican spokeswomen for the Senate committees with jurisdiction over the Treasury, Labor, and Health and Human Services departments said they would not move forward with hearings until the nominees submit their completed paperwork, including signed ethics agreements. “Democrats are creating a red herring here —  there is no concern that forms will not be filled out,” said Margaret Atkinson, spokeswoman for the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. * * * Where did things go awry for the Trump transition? Close observers of the process point to his decision, made just a few days after the election, to replace New Jersey Governor Chris Christie as chairman of his transition committee, along with some of the people who had spent months doing the prep work in Washington for a possible Trump administration. The   had, by his own admission, given little thought to the transition before the election out of a sense of superstition. He and his inner circle took over the operation immediately after November 8, moving the power center from   offices in D. C. to Trump Tower (and his other properties in New Jersey and Florida) where a parade of job seekers has traveled for job interviews. Yet the formal vetting of those candidates has not, in most cases, begun before Trump selects them for a job. Take the case of Cathy McMorris Rodgers, the   Republican congresswoman who was poised to become Trump’s nominee for interior secretary before the   was persuaded to pick Representative Ryan Zinke of Montana instead. Over the course of about 10 days, McMorris Rodgers met twice with Trump and had phone calls with Vice   Mike Pence and one of Trump’s sons, Donald Jr. according to a Republican familiar with the process. Her name was leaked to the press, which reported that she was likely to get the interior job. Yet at no time did Trump officials collect paperwork of any kind from McMorris Rodgers. “We were not asked for anything at all, ever,” this Republican said. The Trump transition team did not respond to requests for comment on their vetting operation. Several people familiar with the transition process said McMorris Rodgers’s experience was not unique. In the case of Tillerson, Trump was not even considering, much less vetting, the oil magnate until his name came up in conversations with former defense chief Robert Gates and Condoleezza Rice, the former secretary of state, according to multiple published reports. “It’s dangerous to nominate first and vet later,” Eisen said. Both he and Painter said numerous potential appointees in the Bush and Obama administrations had walked away from jobs before their names were made public once they found out how much they’d have to divest. Wealthy nominees have had to forgo millions of dollars in stock options as part of ethics agreements, for example. And that doesn’t even account for the damaging personal or political revelations that could threaten Senate confirmation or, at minimum, surprise and embarrass an administration without preliminary internal investigations. The slow pace of the Trump transition is not limited to the vetting of top Cabinet picks. Aside from a dozen or so senior White House advisers, ambassadors, and domestic agency heads, the  ’s team has moved to fill hardly any of the 4, 000 political appointee positions across the federal government, including 1, 100 that are subject to Senate confirmation. Those include under secretaries, assistant secretaries, general counsels, chief financial officers, and agency administrators and directors, among other posts. The Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit that provides guidelines, job descriptions, and advice for presidential transitions, has said the new administration should aim to have 100   appointees in place on or around Inauguration Day. At its present rate, the Trump administration would be lucky to get a dozen. The transition has also thus far disregarded suggestions to name its Cabinet picks as part of larger slates, so that the secretaries do not spend weeks surrounded by empty desks and acting deputies who cannot operate with full authority. “The issue isn’t how many people you announce,” said Max Stier, president and CEO of the Partnership. “The issue is how many qualified people you get in place in real time and working effectively. ” While the Obama transition in   is hailed as the modern gold standard for presidential transfers of power, the process in recent decades has more commonly been fraught and slow. Officials in both parties point in particular to 2000, when the   election recount shortened the transition period. Yet the concern over the Trump operation is heightened by the fact that not only the   but also many of his top Cabinet picks, have little or no experience in government. If they take office alone, they’ll be relying heavily on career civil servants to carry out the enormous change they’ve demanded of the government. That alone might prove to be a significant obstacle. “You can’t effectively change the government,” Stier noted, “if you don’t truly understand how it operates. ”"
Obama Leaves the Constitution Weaker Than He Found It,Atlantic,Garrett Epps,2017-01-03,"Every four years, an American citizen puts a hand on a holy book and swears to “preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. ” Anxiety is understandably high in the weeks before a new hand hits that Bible. But as we obsess about the intentions of the incoming president, it is worth asking ourselves how well the current incumbent has preserved our governing document. A President Without an Administration, History will likely ponder long before rendering a clear verdict. The best we can say now is that, even for those like me who admire Barack Obama, the constitutional record is disturbingly mixed. Obama leaves the Constitution weaker than at the beginning of his terms. It now will pass into the hands of a chief executive who appears to have no respect for its limits. Let’s dispense first with the    critique of this administration —  that it has in some way engaged in “executive overreach,” pushing  executive power to new,   heights. It’s a handy story, easy to tell, and opponents of the Administration are assiduous in repeating it. It is, however, mostly bosh. It puts powdered wigs and knee britches on mundane policy disputes and appalling legislative obstructionism. Most of the big court cases testing Obama’s powers have actually been statutory arguments, with no constitutional issue involved. They have been reported as constitutional clashes, but they were really     legal disputes. Compared with most presidents of the past   —  and especially with his predecessor, George W. Bush —  Barack Obama has in fact been quite reticent about asserting inherent “executive power” under the Constitution. Consider the use of “signing statements” —  documents issued by a president when signing a bill, sometimes indicating that the executive branch will refuse to follow parts of the new law because it believes them unconstitutional. George W. Bush issued more than 160 Obama, in the same time period, 31. In addition, the claim that “executive orders” are   around Congress also doesn’t pass the laugh test. Every president since Washington has used them to implement laws passed by Congress —  without them, bureaucrats can’t enforce new laws. (Some of the programs to which Obama’s critics most strenuously object —  such as the     immigration initiative —  didn’t flow from “executive orders” at all.) But no matter how they have been promulgated, Obama’s uses of executive power have had an intriguing common thread. Under Ronald Reagan and the two presidents Bush, the executive branch often tied itself to the mast of a strong executive, one with “inherent” powers over war, peace, and law enforcement that Congress could not limit in any way. (After Congress passed the sweeping 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military Force, for example, Bush legal adviser John Yoo sent the president a memo advising that the Congress was out of line for passing it, because it suggested he needed authorization to attack any nation or group he chose at any time for any reason.) Obama has never formally subscribed to this   theory. On paper, at least, he has insisted that he is working hard to fulfill the intent of Congress as expressed in statutes. This is a strategy I call “aggressive compliance” —  it pushes the language of a statute as far as it can go in order to avoid a constitutional claim. In practical terms, the result is often the same —  the executive gets its way —   —  but there’s no corresponding assertion that Congress has no power. If, by some bizarre series of events, Congress collected itself to change a statute, and managed to overcome a presidential veto of that change, then, Obama would say, of course he would change his actions. It’s better than simply proclaiming a president beyond the law. But it sometimes skates close to the edge of legality. Consider the administration’s claim that it could, without Congressional authorization, commit U. S. naval and air forces during the 2011 intervention in Libya. The action seemed to violate the 1973 War Powers Resolution, which requires a president to notify Congress before introducing U. S. forces into “hostilities,” and seek permission if that intervention lasts more than 60 days. Many presidents have claimed that the Resolution was an unconstitutional limit on their power. Obama instead issued a careful opinion admitting that the Resolution was valid —  but suggesting that more than 100 cruise missile strikes, and dozens of air missions, were not, somehow, “hostilities. ” It was too clever by half, and it is a lasting blot on Obama’s constitutional copybook. Even worse, however, is the continued conduct of open hostilities in Iraq and Syria against the Islamic State despite the refusal of Congress to approve the military campaign. No one questions that the Constitution applies here but because the two branches are unable to agree on the scope of American intervention, this most crucial of constitutional guarantees —  the power of Congress to authorize military action —  has gone by the board. This is not entirely the president’s fault —  the administration and its allies have repeatedly begged Congress to at least hold hearings on an authorization bill. As is often the case in history, legislators would prefer to stay out of the arena so that they can later claim credit for victory but disclaim any role in disaster. And just to underline how obsolete Congressional authorization has become, consider that the most searing   attacks on Obama arise from the one occasion on which he announced he would not intervene abroad without Congressional authorization —  his 2013 decision not to launch airstrikes against Syria without first going to Congress. Whether he was using constitutional caution as an excuse or not, the Constitution clearly required authorization, while the political class of both parties has treated Obama’s caution as contemptible. As a   Obama had his limits. Obama hands over to the Trump administration a National Security Agency that is pursuing a robust a program of domestic and foreign surveillance, under the relatively thin constraints provided by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act Amendments of 2008. The Obama administration has been stunningly aggressive in its incursions on   by reporters, prosecuting leakers under the Espionage Act and demanding the phone records of 20 Associated Press reporters as part of a leak investigation. These were far beyond the previous norms —   —  and are now part of the background practices inherited by the Trump Administration. The drone warfare program that has grown up under this administration is also only nominally constrained by law, with prerogative for the air assassination of Americans abroad at the disposal of the new executive. The administration’s decision not to pursue any serious criminal investigation of torture and illegal detention under Bush means that the formal roadblocks to Trump’s resumption of these crimes (which he has promised) will be few. So well protected was the   establishment under Obama that its head, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, was forced to admit lying to Congress under oath about the NSA “metadata” program —   —  and suffered no adverse consequences as a result. The above is a sobering record for an administration that liked to pose as a friend of the Constitution and of civil liberties. History’s judgment may be tempered by the evidence that Obama wanted to do better. He struggled for eight years, for example, to close the extraterritorial prison camp at Guantanamo. He did seek authorization for the IS campaign. He tried hard to reach across the partisan aisle to forge legislation. In those efforts, he was largely stymied by an opposition whose commitment to genuine constitutionalism was, not to put too fine a point on it, almost nil. The new   Republican Party that emerged from the 2010 elections took, and takes, no responsibility for constitutional norms, whether it was honoring the obligations of the national debt or considering presidential nominees to judgeships and executive agencies. But the job of a president is to overcome obstacles, build political support, and mobilize public opinion. Obama’s record is that of a smart, determined, but politically weak president. Regardless of fault, there’s little doubt that he leaves the Constitution weaker than he found it."

Making Waves: A new study in the journal Science Advances confirms that the world’s oceans have steadily warmed for the past five decades, flying in the face of speculation by Representative Lamar Smith that similar findings from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration were politically biased. The research underscores how climate change is a scientific fact —  and thus solutions can and should come from both sides of the aisle. Toward that goal, a small group of GOP environmentalists is hopeful that   Donald Trump —  despite his ominous record of denying climate science —  will pursue solutions using the free market. In the meantime, President Obama has shored up another environmental legacy: With the creation and expansion of several marine monuments, he’s protected more ocean than any other U. S. president. Speaking of Legacy: Republicans in Congress will likely vote soon to repeal Obamacare, although they haven’t yet proposed a specific plan to replace it. Instead, they’ll likely delay the   in hopes of easing the transition —  but this approach could still cause chaos in the   market as patients scramble to get coverage while they can.

Political Geography: In the aftermath of the U. S. presidential election, one of the most discussed factors has been the   divide —  a cultural disconnect between   and country communities, coupled with an electoral system that gives people in less populated areas more relative power. That issue isn’t limited to Americans: Over 20 other countries, notably Japan and Argentina, have systems that favor rural voters, sometimes with serious policy consequences. Back in the U. S. Democrats are trying to work within the system by renewing their focus on local politics —  but here’s why that shift might be too difficult. Jessica Lahey on “design thinking,” one of education’s latest buzzwords: Historically, creativity has been portrayed as a mysterious, elusive force —  a gift from the gods or the muses. Creativity can’t be summoned, the thinking goes, let alone taught to the mentally inflexible, unimaginative,   masses. Design thinking upends that perception and assumes that anyone can be a creative  . At its best, design thinking incorporates   teaching techniques such as   inquiry and collaborative   and dovetails nicely with   learning curricula that emphasize interpersonal skills such as collaboration and empathy. And the end result of a   project is often a tangible product, such as a model city, a robot, or a better mousetrap.  It’s no surprise, then, that many educators are eager to adopt design thinking as a way to plan their own teaching and as a strategy for helping their students learn through solving   problems.   …     If it is hastily and inexpertly implemented by educators with a weak or incomplete understanding of its principles, however, it is likely to be a waste of energy and precious classroom time. Keep reading here, as Lahey explains what exactly design thinking is, and how teachers can make the best use of it. 1.

The main reason I wanted to become a citizen is so I could vote for Barack Obama as president of these United States of America. It was a very proud day for me. My wife, other family, and some good friends were with me at the Los Angeles convention center, and there were thousands of people being sworn in that day. The thing that struck me was that some of them really didn’t seem to give a damn about what was happening, while for me —  all dressed up in my best suit and tie —  it was really quite emotional.

On this day in 1847, Samuel Colt —  described in our November 1880 issue as “a man of fine presence   …     and of indomitable perseverance” —  sold a thousand of his first revolvers to the Texas Rangers. In our November 2000 issue, Richard Slotkin described how firearms subsequently spread: The techniques of mass production and serial fire perfected by Samuel Colt made guns cheaper to own and easier to use. The handgun —  which had been a luxury item in the days of the   flint pistol —  was now a viable weapon for the ordinary citizen interested in   and killing small game. But lower prices alone did not cause gun ownership to spread. The California Gold Rush and the opening of the Far West to settlement increased population and activity in the contested borderlands between the United States and Mexico and around Native American tribes. The expansion of slavery into unsettled districts and the growth of large plantations (coupled with abolitionist agitation) led to more arming of planters’ households and patrols.   …     This initial increase in gun circulation led to further gun purchases.

"Coming Soon to the U.S. Army: Turbans, Beards, Hijabs, and Cornrows",Atlantic,Emma Green,2017-01-04,"Updated 6:01 p. m. EST, The Army has issued a new regulation: Effective immediately,   commanders will be able to grant accommodations to servicemen and women who wear beards, turbans, or hijabs for religious reasons —  the three most common requests for waivers to current guidelines on grooming and dress, according to a letter from the Secretary of the Army, Eric Fanning. The new guidelines also revise hairstyle standards for female soldiers: They can now wear dreadlocks, cornrows, or twists, provided they’re relatively small, uniform, neat, and tied off inconspicuously, and they don’t have to request an accommodation to do so. The Trouble With Wearing Turbans in America, This might seem like an odd choice for a policy directive in the final days of the Obama administration. It came about largely in response to litigation and advocacy from Sikh servicemen who wear beards and turbans for religious reasons, and who wanted to be able to keep them while actively serving. While this ruling will make a big difference for those soldiers, there are very few of them. Eric Baxter, an attorney at the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, one of the firms that has been advocating on behalf of the Sikh soldiers, attributed the timing to fear of continued litigation. “The pressure of the lawsuit was a significant factor in deciding this needs to be finished,” he said. “The time had just come when it was no longer possible to make excuses for why Sikhs need to be excluded. ” It’s possible that the Army felt it had no options and wanted to put the issue to rest, but also possible the directive reflects some other unstated motive. Regardless of the intent, though, this regulation sends a signal: It makes the Army more inclusive of minority religions and cultures, right as Donald Trump prepares to take office. The new regulations are a response to a   issue within the military. In the 1986, the Supreme Court heard a case brought by an Orthodox Jewish rabbi, Simcha Goldman, who had been forbidden by the Air Force to wear a yarmulke while on duty and in uniform. The Court deferred to the military. In response, Congress passed a rule stating that servicemen should be able to wear religious apparel. “When you look at the legislative history for that law, Congress spoke openly about the need to accommodate Sikhs and Jews,” said Baxter. “But the military has always construed it as only applying to the yarmulke. ” Over the years, military officers have regularly dealt with requests for religious exemptions to various rules. Douglas Carver, a Southern Baptist minister who is the former chief chaplain for the Army, said he faced his first religious exemption requests almost as soon as he became a chaplain. When he retired from service in 2011, the conversation about a possible   revision had already been happening for years, he said. “The military is strong on tradition and order. When you’re going to have someone who looks different in the ranks, it takes a lot of discussion and exploration and advisement. ” Recently, Sikhs have taken up the cause. Within the last year, several serviceman have sued the Army to be able to keep their turbans and beards. Until now, the Army has responded with temporary fixes —  exemptions granted on a limited,    basis. The military expressed safety concerns about the way beards or other headwear might undermine the effectiveness of gear, and began conducting studies about the feasibility of broader exemptions. Over time, these exemptions provided evidence that soldiers could successfully serve while wearing   dress, according to Fanning’s letter. Now, officers across the military will be able to address requests for religious exemptions with the guidance of the Chaplain Corps, which is responsible for training service units on the new rules. Once an accommodation has been granted, it can only be permanently revoked by the secretary of the Army or his designee. The military will also continue testing for safety hazards for now, soldiers with religious accommodations are restricted from serving in positions involving toxic chemicals and other potentially dangerous substances. Carver sees the new regulation as an accomplishment for the Army. Faith is a major part of many service members’ lives religious affiliation is even listed on soldiers’ dog tags, he pointed out. “You are prepared to go into harm’s way, even to die, and practice of your religious belief brings courage and calmness,” he said. “A soldier should not have to feel that he’s about to give his life for his country, but that he doesn’t want to compromise his individual faith or practices. ” The new policy seems to be in keeping with other military policies set during the Obama administration. In June, Secretary of Defense Ash Carter announced a new policy allowing transgender service members to serve openly. “We can’t allow barriers unrelated to a person’s qualifications prevent us from recruiting and retaining those who can best accomplish the mission,” he said. The new regulations on religious dress and hairstyles address a different issue, but they still accomplish the same basic goal: They make the largest branch of the military more inclusive, and allow more Americans to serve their country."
Why Is Trump So Reluctant to Accept Claims of Russian Hacking?,Atlantic,David A. Graham,2017-01-04,"Even by the   standards of the   Donald Trump’s response to the accusations of Russian interference with the election is somewhat puzzling. On the side that believes Russia is to blame, and ought to be punished, are the White House the Republican leadership and most of the    in both houses of Congress and the intelligence community. They point to a plausible motive, which is the Kremlin’s hatred of Hillary Clinton, and a plausible precursor, which is the Kremlin’s pattern of interfering with other governments’ elections. Opposing them are Trump, his inner circles of aides, the Kremlin, which denies responsibility, and WikiLeaks, which insists it did not receive the documents from   hackers. While there is some principled skepticism about attributing the hacks to Russia, Trump’s mockery of the intelligence community has not cited specific concerns. And if, as his adviser Kellyanne Conway suggests, Trump is receiving information from other sources, it’s unclear why it would be more credible or accurate than that provided by the intelligence community. Moreover, neither Trump’s record of being either misinformed or simply uninformed about policy matters foreign and domestic, nor his choice of Mike Flynn, who has a penchant for lending credence to unsubstantiated conspiracy theories, as his national security adviser, provide much reason to believe him over the consensus view of the intelligence community. But Trump’s reluctance to publicly accept Russian responsibility for the hack might have less to do with how he views the evidence than with how he views the stakes of the argument. He has consistently placed his emphasis on winning, and on presenting himself as a winner. And to the extent that claims of Russian hacking call the nature of his electoral victory into doubt, he’s responded by dismissing those claims, and emphasizing his triumph. Take this pair of tweets on Wednesday morning: Somebody hacked the DNC but why did they not have ”hacking defense” like the RNC has and why have they not responded to the terrible. ..... things they did and said (like giving the questions to the debate to H). A total double standard! Media, as usual, gave them a pass. On its face, this argument is incoherent. There’s no evident conflict between the view that the DNC should have maintained better defenses against intruders and acted more forcefully when informed about hacking attempts, and the view that foreign interference with U. S. elections is a dangerous thing. Trump’s emphasis on a particular detail in the leaked DNC emails is similarly baffling. In one email, once and current interim DNC Chair Donna Brazile was revealed to have passed along a question for a future Democratic primary debate to the Hillary Clinton campaign. That was hardly ignored by the press Brazile lost her contributor gig at CNN as a result. Bernie Sanders might be justifiably upset about Brazile’s actions, although the question she passed to Clinton was eminently predictable, but   cheating in a Democratic presidential debate is also unrelated to the charge that a foreign government attempted to influence the presidential general election. But the tweets become more legible if they’re read as a simple tally of advantages and disadvantages. Trump is unusually focused on “fairness” —  consider the number of times he has tweeted about it —  although his definition of the word often seems to hinge on whether or not something is good for him. But this idiosyncratic conception of fairness helps to explain Trump’s view of the hacks: If hacks targeted at the DNC helped give him a leg up, then they are counterbalanced by Brazile’s cheating, even if one is the result of a questionable   model of hiring partisan operators and the other is allegedly designed to undermine American democracy. Many Democrats encouraged this kind of thinking, in which partisan advantage is the metric by which competing claims are evaluated, with their muted responses to the initial reports of Russian hacking. When they believed that the interference was simply a headwind that would hinder but not stop Hillary Clinton’s march to the White House, they were willing to not make a big deal out of it. They may be right, now, that foreign interference in American elections is unacceptable, but they undermined their standing to make that case by downplaying it when they thought they had the political advantage. The same   view might also help explain the alliances Trump strikes, which follow an almost amusingly straightforward        formulation. Perhaps Trump reasons that if he’s against Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, Obama is out to get Putin, and Putin is out to get Clinton, then he should be for Putin. This would be one way to explain the sudden embrace of Julian Assange by Trump and his supporters. In 2010, CNN reports, Trump was asked about Wikileaks: “I think it’s disgraceful, I think there should be like death penalty or something. ” Fox News’ Sean Hannity also used to deplore Assange, but now finds him eminently trustworthy when he says Russian hackers were not WikiLeaks’ source. Sarah Palin has decided he’s OK, too. Meanwhile, Trump’s ostensible ally Paul Ryan, the speaker of the House, told Hugh Hewitt on Wednesday that Assange was “a sycophant for Russia” who “steals data and compromises national security. ” (Of course, one can believe the documents Assange has produced over the years while still questioning his motivations and his account of how he obtained those files.) The press has eagerly ferreted out scores of inconsistencies in Trump’s public statements. On the hacks alone, there’s the conflict between his openly saying Russia should hack Hillary Clinton and his recent refusal to acknowledge Russia might even be a factor, or between his discussion of hacking during the campaign and his more recent, preposterous claim that no one brought it up during the campaign. Reporters should continue to do this, because it’s a valuable service for the public, but it’s not a surprise that Trump isn’t ashamed of the inconsistencies. Trump’s calculus is much simpler and more manichean. It was often said that Barack Obama was playing “  chess” against his opponents. Trump is proudly playing checkers. And he’s winning."
Earth’s Oceans Are Steadily Warming,Atlantic,Robinson Meyer,2017-01-04,"It’s sometimes said that modern science spends too much time on the documentation of a new trend and too little time on the replication of old ones. A new paper published Wednesday in the   journal Science Advances is important just because it does the latter. In fact, it sheds light on the scientific process in action —  and also reveals how   denialists can muddy that process. Here’s the big takeaway from the new study: Across the planet, the ocean surface has been warming at a relatively steady clip over the past 50 years. This warming trend shows up whether the ocean is measured by buoy, by satellite, or by autonomous floating drone. It also shows up in the global temperature dataset created and maintained by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). In fact, the warming shows up in both datasets in essentially the same way. This is important because it confirms the integrity of the NOAA dataset —  and adds further evidence to the argument that ocean temperatures have steadily warmed this century without a significant slowdown. “Our results essentially confirm that NOAA got it right,” says Zeke Hausfather, a researcher and economist at the University of California Berkeley. “They weren’t cooking the books. They weren’t bowing to any political pressure to find results that show extra warming. They were a bunch of scientists trying their hardest to work with messy data. ” Here’s why the finding matters: In June 2015, NOAA published an update to its   dataset of historical global temperatures. Thomas Karl, the director of the National Centers for Environmental Information, and his colleagues at NOAA explained in a paper in Science that the old database had a critical flaw. In trying to merge temperature readings taken by ships and buoys, NOAA had been allowing “cooling bias” to seep into its numbers. In other words, NOAA’s global temperature estimates had been too low, and its measurement of climate change was too conservative. With this newly updated data in hand, Karl and his colleagues found there had been no slowdown in global warming during the 2000s. NOAA’s new findings disagreed with those of the U. K. Met Office, whose widely used global temperature dataset does show a slowdown in the 2000s. So: Was there a slowdown? This is an interesting problem of some scientific interest. Researchers have pointed to El Niño, to multiyear oceanic cycles, and to the   reforestation of Russia as possible explanations for the change. But here’s the thing: The slowdown, or lack thereof, never threw the larger phenomenon of   climate change into question. In fact, even among the most conservative estimates, the globe kept warming right through the slowdown. The overwhelming consensus of Earth scientists is that the planet is harmfully warming due to human industrial activity. What’s more, if a slowdown did occur in the 2000s, it seems to have abated now. The previous three years —  2014, 2015, and 2016 —  have all broken the record as the hottest year ever in the modern temperature record. But this hasn’t seemed to matter in public debate, as   denialists have found enormous success casting doubt on global warming by glomming onto this “slowdown” debate. When the UN’s 2013 assessment report on climate science said a slowdown seemed to have occurred, it dominated press accounts. That same report also found that global warming was real, quickly becoming irreversible, and that humans were more implicated in the phenomenon than ever —  but it hardly seemed to matter. It was the slowdown that made headlines. Perhaps this is why Representative Lamar Smith, a Republican of Texas who chairs the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, siezed on the 2015 NOAA study. Smith rejects the existence of climate change, and he alleged that that NOAA scientists had “altered the data” in their study to get a chosen result. So in late 2015, he issued a subpoena to the agency, demanding all emails related to the study. Several months later, he expanded the demand again, requiring all documents and communications that included the words “temperature,” “change,” “climate,” “Obama,” “buoy,” “Karl,” “ship,” and “Paris. ” During this time, Smith falsely represented the research on the topic. He said climate data had “clearly showed no warming for the past two decades,” which is not true. And when a new paper arguing for a slowdown during a different time period came out last year in Science, Smith said that it “confirms the halt in global warming. ” But that paper showed no halt —  it only argued for the slowdown. And its authors specifically wrote: “We do not believe that warming has ceased. ” There is no valid scientific debate about a “halt,” but Smith seemed to be trying to manufacture one. The Center for Science and Democracy, a nonpartisan advocacy group for scientists in the civil service, said that Smith was harassing NOAA for doing its job. “The use of a sledgehammer of a congressional subpoena to cast so wide a net is unprecedented and unjustified,” said Andrew Rosenberg, its director, in a letter to the House committee. In June of this year, Smith responded by issuing a subpoena to the Center’s parent organization, the Union of Concerned Scientists. The   said that Smith was well outside his legal authority, and it declined to respond. * * * Which brings us back to the new study. It finds that Smith was wrong: NOAA’s results are scientifically defensible, and its global temperature records match those prepared by different means. It does this by comparing NOAA’s record to all the smaller, highly reliable records that constitute it. “The way that NOAA makes an ocean record is they take data from a lot of different sources, and they smush it all together into a single record. They do this so they can have a long, continuous record back to 1880 or so,” Hausfather told me. Creating a record from 1880 is difficult, however —  especially for the oceans, where there are no   weather stations. Scientists have to piece disparate historical records together over time. This is a typical problem in climate science, but it’s typical that some of those constituent datasets impose slightly different biases on the data. Before the 1990s, most of NOAA’s   records came from ships logs. Ships are tricky because they have historically measured the sea surface in different ways. During the   century, most sailors measured the water temperature using “bucket measurements”: They hauled a bucket over the side, dipped it in the water, brought it up, and put a thermometer in it. More recently, most ships measure the ocean temperature mechanically through an “  valve. ” Ships pump water into their hull in order to cool the engine room, and a thermometer measures its temperature on the way. This can introduce bias to the numbers, though: Because engine rooms get hot,    readings are skewed warmer than the actual ocean. That’s partly why, since the 1990s, the governments of the world have deployed a fleet of new sensors to measure the changing sea. Buoys, satellites, and autonomous sensors called Argo floats all patrol the ocean and measure its conditions. This has dramatically changed the makeup of NOAA’s temperature record: Whereas 95 percent of NOAA’s readings came from ship engine rooms in the early 1990s, 85 percent now come from buoys. The fleet has provided a wealth of new data for climate science. But it also provokes the central scientific question of the NOAA study. Given the same patch of ocean, a thermometer on a buoy will produce a colder measurement than a thermometer on an   valve. This introduces some bias to the record —  bias which, for years, NOAA never corrected. Think of what was happening in historical context: At the same time the oceans were supposedly experiencing a slowdown in warming, NOAA transitioned from mostly ships to mostly using buoys. The underlying ocean may still have been warming, but NOAA’s record was diluted by thermometers inclined to be cooler and cooler. “The problem was, NOAA previously was just sticking the buoy data in with the ship data —  and not accounting for the fact that the buoy data was about a tenth of a degree cooler than the ship,” says Hausfather. This was Karl’s insight: He and the NOAA team found that, once this discrepancy was corrected for, the slowdown disappeared from their record. In fact, removing this discrepancy was the main focus of their infamous 2015 study. The team behind Wednesday’s Science Advances paper wanted to test this idea. There’s all this disagreement over correcting for bias, they thought. What if you looked only at records that didn’t need to be corrected? So Hausfather and his colleagues compared the new NOAA data to what they call “instrumentally homogenous records” —  that is, records created by sensors that did not change throughout the period in question. In this case, those sensors are   buoys, Argo floaters, and   satellites. What they found is that the   records matched the new NOAA global temperature records almost precisely. Almost all the   records showed that the   NOAA records had a cooling bias. They also showed a slight cooling bias in the more popular U. K. database. Specifically, data from the buoys and satellites agree with the NOAA record nearly perfectly. Those records are considered the most reliable, and they cover the entire period studied. The Argo data covers the shortest amount of time —  only 11 years —  so the authors used three different global realizations of the same raw data. Two of the three of those sets found that NOAA’s data may have been too cool. The third “was more ambiguous,” write the authors. And that means they showed no global warming slowdown. “There’s no evidence from a statistical standpoint that temperatures over the last 15 years have been warming any slower than temperatures over the last 30 years or the last 50 years,” Hausfather told me. The paper has been greeted warmly by the larger climate science community, at least so far. “The laborious process in which scientists check and recheck their work and subject their ideas to peer review has led to another success,” writes John Abraham, a thermal scientist who studies ocean temperatures, at The Guardian. “This paper is another reminder why it is so important to invest in the temperature measurements that are needed to create   climate records. We really need uninterrupted measurements that span many   if we want to truly understand the Earth’s changing climate,” he adds. It’s not clear that this paper will end the scientific dispute over whether the early 2000s showed anomalous warming or not. But it should end any spurious claims that NOAA’s updates were politically motivated. And it should refocus readers on the main point: Human activity is already warming Earth and causing harmful changes to the seas, ice, weather, and land. On that, climate science is in overwhelming agreement."
Trump Picks Jay Clayton to Head the SEC,Atlantic,Bourree Lam,2017-01-04,"On Wednesday, Trump’s transition team confirmed that the   will nominate Jay Clayton to be chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In recent days, Clayton, a Wall Street lawyer, had emerged as the frontrunner, ahead of other rumored considerations including Debra Wong Yang, a former U. S. Attorney, and activist investor Carl Icahn. In a press release, Trump called Clayton “a highly talented expert on many aspects of financial and regulatory law,” who will take part in “unleashing the   power of our economy by encouraging investment in American companies while providing strong oversight of Wall Street and related industries. ” Clayton is currently a partner at the law firm Sullivan  Cromwell who works with Wall Street firms on mergers and acquisitions and regulatory investigations. According to the law firm’s website, Clayton represented large banks, including Goldman Sachs and Barclays Capital, during the financial crisis. He’s also represented large financial institutions looking to settle   claims with authorities. The SEC is often referred to as Wall Street’s watchdog. The agency is tasked with protecting investors and maintaining fair markets, which can include everything from investigating claims of unfair trading practices to implementing rules and regulations to keep financial markets —  and those who trade in them —  safe. That’s a large part of the reason that the nomination for the head of the SEC has been closely watched. During the campaign,   Trump said that his intent was to cut regulation “massively. ” In the press release announcing the intention to nominate Clayton, Trump added, “We need to undo many regulations which have stifled investment in American businesses, and restore oversight of the financial industry in a way that does not harm American workers. ” Many expect that a   Trump administration will reshape the way the agency polices Wall Street, but it isn’t immediately clear which specific regulations the new SEC chairman would scale back on, and how. One set of regulations that’s been mentioned is the   Act, which the SEC enforces, and which Trump’s team has promised to “dismantle. ” Still, it’s largely unclear what Clayton’s stance on rolling back regulation would be. In the press release, Clayton echoed Trump’s sentiment that policy should be set to encourage job creation. Mary Jo White, the SEC’s current chairman, announced her plans to step down after the election, which isn’t unusual during a change of administration. But there will be significantly more turnover than White. There are two additional openings on the   commission. (Traditionally, the commission is made up of two Democratic commissioners and two Republican commissioners in addition to the chairman.) And four division directors at the SEC have announced their departures in the past month, including Andrew Ceresney, the director of the SEC’s enforcement division. The exodus was largely expected after White announced her departure, but with so many empty seats, it opens the door for the SEC, and its new head, to be less tough on Wall Street banks."
Two Major Credit Reporting Agencies Have Been Lying to Consumers,Atlantic,Gillian B. White,2017-01-04,"In personal finance, practically everything can turn on one’s credit score. It’s both an indicator of one’s financial past, and the key to accessing necessities —  without insane costs —  in the future. But on Tuesday, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau announced that two of the three major   agencies responsible for doling out those scores —  Equifax and Transunion —  have been deceiving and taking advantage of Americans. The Bureau ordered the agencies to pay more than $23 million in fines and restitution.   In their investigation, the Bureau found that the two agencies had been misrepresenting the scores provided to consumers, telling them that the score reports they received were the same reports that lenders and businesses received, when, in fact, they were not. The investigation also found problems with the way the agencies advertised their products, using promotions that suggested that their credit reports were either free or cost only $1. According to the CFPB the agencies did not properly disclose that after a trial of seven to 30 days, individuals would be enrolled in a   subscription, which could total $16 or more per month. The Bureau also found Equifax to be in violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, which states that the agencies must provide one free report every 12 months made available at a central site. Before viewing their free report, consumers were forced to view advertisements for Equifax, which is prohibited by law. That these credit agencies would abuse their power to mislead Americans attempting to take a more active role in monitoring their financial health is not only a violation of trust, it is dangerous. These agencies —  along with a third, Experian —  make up the nation’s   industry, and, as such, they wield a significant and unique influence over America’s’ financial health. Many lenders use only the data from these providers to determine whether someone can get a loan and how much interests he will pay. “Credit scores are central to a consumer’s financial life and people deserve honest and accurate information about them,” said CFPB Director Richard Cordray in a statement.   agencies keep track of an individual’s overall debt picture, how much credit they have access to, and how frequently payments are late, among other things. They then assign a score ranging from 300 to 850, which is consulted before one rents an apartment, gets a loan, opens a credit card, buys a car, or even gets a cell phone. Much of an individual’s ability to improve his or her finances is predicated on his or her ability to maintain a high credit score. To do that, he or she needs to be able to see accurate credit reports that reflect the information that lenders see when they assess them. The actions of Equifax and Transunion prevented that. And that’s especially troubling because the American credit system is a reinforcing cycle. Good credit often comes from having enough money to pay bills off in a timely manner, which raises one’s score and provides access to more credit at better interest rates. That can amount to tens of thousands of dollars in savings on mortgages, business loans, and   card interest. And having good credit means that a person’s score can sustain the decline that comes with lender inquiries for new credit cards or loans, which then gives them access to more credit —  and raises their score once again. For Americans with bad credit and little income, they system works in exactly the opposite manner, and leaves people relegated to pricey and predatory options for basic financial needs. In 2010, the CFPB found that 26 million Americans had no credit history, and another 19 million had such limited credit history that they were considered unscorable. These groups were primarily made up of   and minority households. Credit scores and the agencies that provide them have long been a point of contention among consumer advocates, not only because the system further marginalizes those who are already struggling, but also because it offers very limited opportunities to improve one’s financial standing. Even obtaining, understanding, and correcting official credit reports can be tricky,   and, in some cases, costly.  As a result, consumer advocates have called for greater accessibility and pushed  alternative credit indicators. That two major providers of score data have been intentionally deceiving Americans confirms what those advocates have been saying all along: This is a deeply dysfunctional system that is hurting the Americans who can least afford it."
The Growing Urban-Rural Divide Around the World,Atlantic,Jon Emont,2017-01-04,"Immediately following the U. S. presidential election on November 8,   Trump demonstrations sprang up in New York, San Francisco, and Los Angeles —  cities that vote overwhelmingly Democratic. The protesters felt robbed: Hillary Clinton had won the majority of voters nationwide. But, like Al Gore in 2000, Clinton was hamstrung by the Electoral College, an institution designed to ensure a voice for sparsely populated states in America’s early years —  and one that, of late, has spelled doom for candidates with   coalitions. 10 Elections to Watch in 2017, The outsized influence of rural voters may seem like a unique feature —  or bug —  of the American political system. But a similar story recurs in places around the world. In over 20 countries, from Argentina, to Malaysia, to Japan, the structure of the electoral systems gives rural voters disproportionate power, relative to their numbers, over their more numerous   counterparts. And on certain issues, this can shift national priorities in favor of rural ones. In the United States in 2016, for example, the Republican platform called for eliminating federal funding for public transit, arguing that it “serves only a small portion of the population, concentrated in six big cities,” implying that Trump’s expected infrastructure bill could focus on highways rather than on urban transit networks. Global warming, of special concern to urban coastal voters, has been described essentially as intriguing speculation by the  . In America, each state, regardless of population size, receives at least three electors, and a candidate who wins a majority of a state’s popular vote wins all of its electors, assuming all those electors accept the vote (with the exceptions of Nebraska and Maine). Effectively, this means that the 259, 000 registered voters of   mostly conservative Wyoming, have around three and a half times as much representation in the electoral college as the 12. 5 million and 18 million voters, respectively, of large, heavily urban states like New York and California. Perhaps the nightmare scenario for this kind of electoral imbalance is Argentina. The country’s upper house of parliament is modeled off the U. S. Senate —  where each state is represented by two senators —  so underpopulated states have the same voting power as densely populated Buenos Aires. But in Argentina’s lower house, each province, no matter its population, receives at least five representatives, thanks to reforms passed by the outgoing military government in 1983 that, in effect, gave a leg up to conservative politicians. As a result, the voters of Tierra El Fuego, a sparsely populated province, have 180 times as much representation per person as Buenos Aires voters in the Chamber of Deputies. This has a major impact on policy. Ezequial Ocantos, an associate professor of comparative politics at the University of Oxford, said that voters in Argentina’s outlying provinces receive massive cash transfers from the federal government even as the country as a whole struggles to maintain fiscal solvency. “Some people would say [this is] at the heart of Argentina’s fiscal problems. There’s some truth to that,” Ocantos said. By many measures, outlying provinces are dramatically   by Argentina’s central government than is Buenos Aires, which contains around 40 percent of the country’s population. “Lots of studies show these [outlying] provinces get more infrastructure and [state] employment,” said Maria Victoria Murillo, a political science professor at Columbia. This contributes to Buenos Aires’s mounting struggles to provide affordable housing and   infrastructure for its ballooning population, as well as the province’s disproportionately high unemployment rate compared with the rest of the country. Japan’s legislature does not fare much better on this score. Its apportionment of representatives was never fully updated to reflect   migration to urban areas after World War II, when the country rebuilt its   cities and quickly industrialized. In 2013, the country’s highest court ruled that Japan’s elections existed “in a state of unconstitutionality,” due to the extra voting power wielded by rural voters. (This warning, however, failed to prompt   changes to the system.) The result has been policies that hurt the urban majority but benefited the rural minority. Michael Thies, a professor of political science at the University of California, Los Angeles, credited the power of the rural vote in Japan with delaying structural reforms to the economy, such as lowering the country’s onerous food import tariffs and decreasing   agricultural subsidies. The dominant Liberal Democratic Party has “been trying to wean the party off the organized rural vote in favor of market liberalization for nearly 20 years, but they have struggled with the ability of those rural interests to fight back,” Thies said. It’s only now, with the country’s dwindling rural voters representing such a small percentage of the population, that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has succeeded in pushing through   agricultural reforms. In particular, the power wielded by elderly rural voters has, arguably, contributed to widespread pessimism among Japanese urbanites about their economic future. Japan has one of the world’s oldest populations and, as in the United States, rural voters tend to be substantially older than urban voters. The power of the elderly rural vote has made it very difficult for Japan, already saddled with one of the world’s greatest debt burdens, to reform its expensive social security system in a way that would curb benefits and attempt to make it sustainable for future generations. “If representation was shifted to a more     result, then the power of the agricultural lobby and the social security lobby   …     would be reduced,” Robert Feldman, the head of Japan economic research at Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities Co. told Bloomberg. But     remains a pipe dream in Japan, which could help explain why the country’s largely urban youth are the most pessimistic young people in the world, with 37 percent expecting to work until they die. Meanwhile, globalization is polarizing urban and rural voter decisions throughout the world, including in the United States. Jonathan Rodden, a professor of political science at Stanford who is writing a book about   voter cleavages, said, “The people who benefit from globalization and trade live in cosmopolitan city centers, and the people who feel left behind typically live outside the city centers.   …     I would anticipate a growing   cleavage based on that. ” There’s plenty of evidence for this. In Austria’s national elections in December, Alexander Van der Bellen, the Green Party candidate, triumphed narrowly over Norbert Hofer of the   Freedom Party, after getting a majority in nine of Austria’s 10 largest cities the Freedom Party, by contrast, won most rural districts handily. In Britain, those who voted to leave the European Union were concentrated in rural areas. The same goes for the support base of France’s   leader Marine Le Pen. Donald Trump lost cities by historic margins but made up for that with his rural support base. The worry is that if globalization leads urban and rural voters to embrace starkly different political agendas around the world, democracies like the United States that give rural voters extra power will face crises of legitimacy as national policy is determined by a political minority. “Politics is just a pitched battle between these two geographically based groups,” Rodden said. There is already reason to worry that Donald Trump will exacerbate this divide. He has emphasized social issues that strongly polarize rural and urban voters, by promising to appoint judges who will modify Roe vs. Wade as well as protect the second amendment. His economic policies may be just as polarizing. “If his economic policy is primarily an effort to bring back manufacturing in the Rust Belt and bring back coal [at] the expense of the innovation economy and knowledge economy in the cities   …     that would presumably have an impact on how people evaluate” the fairness of the constitutional system, Rodden said. The risk for the United States is that a failure to reform its democratic system will lead to the same crises of legitimacy seen in democratic systems elsewhere, as its urban majorities question why their priorities go ignored. Kai Ostwald, a professor of Comparative Politics at the University of British Columbia, compared America’s situation to that of Malaysia, where urban voters are disillusioned after failing to unseat the ruling party despite winning the popular vote in the 2013 election. This happened thanks to a districting system that favors rural areas in terms of parliamentary representatives, he said. “It will certainly take time before we get the kind of disenfranchisement and sense of helplessness in the U. S. that is pervasive in Malaysia, [one where] the political system is so fundamentally biased that there is no sense in participating. But I’m not sure that that sense isn’t already quite strong in the U. S. electorate,” he said. Certainly there is a sense of desperation among some American voters, now that the loser of the popular vote has won the presidency in two of the last five elections —  both times, at a Democrat’s expense. (Some Democratic electors reportedly plotted a futile,   effort to select someone other than Trump as President.) Prominent Silicon Valley titans have latched onto plans to have California secede from the union out of frustration with the Electoral College. Those frustrated with the Electoral College can take inspiration from Argentina, which succeeded in abolishing its own ahead of a 1995 national election, as part of a political compromise that allowed voter in Buenos Aires to be equally represented in elections for this one branch of government. (The legislature is another matter.) But such a compromise is almost impossible to imagine in today’s polarized Washington where the Republicans that now control the government have no incentive to tamper with a political system that benefits them. “If the frustration level gets ratcheted up I don’t know where we go. There’s either institutional reform or secession. Neither of those things happen easily given our constitution. That’s just the predicament that we’re in,” Rodden said."
Hedge-Fund Managers With Flashy Sports Cars Make Worse Investors,Atlantic,Nicholas Clairmont,2017-01-04,"   For most lay investors, figuring out how to allocate money presents a dilemma. A dizzying maze of experts, investors, fund managers, and advisors exists to allow people to outsource their questions to a financial professional who can make responsible decisions on their behalf to grow savings. But to reliably figure out who won’t rip them off or make bad calls, regular people have to know so much that they could almost invest the money themselves in the first place. Finance writers and others in the   business offer some shortcuts to try to keep things simple. These range from the objectively good —  making sure that the people in charge of money have an obligation to put clients’ interests first, without which they’re likely to look out for themselves and their employer —  to the more dubious and  . To wit: One famous old rule has it that clients looking to hand over their money should avoid advisors who drive flashy sports cars, since they’re likely to be   unscrupulous, or both. Conversely, those with a practical,   car are said to perform better. Turns out, this is one of those bits of folk wisdom that happens to be true. A group of researchers from NYU’s Stern School of Business, the University of Central Florida, the University of Florida’s Warrington College of Business Administration, and Singapore Management University set out to test it empirically, looking at a sample of 1, 774 vehicles owned by 1, 144   managers. Based on information that financiers are required by law to disclose to the government, he and his fellow researchers looked up   data on car purchases, and matched the   to the autos. Sure enough,   cars signal   investors: The study finds that leadfoots make more trades, bring in smaller returns for clients, exhibit a greater volatility in the returns their investments earn per year, and are more likely to have been caught violating financial regulations. The researchers, Stephen Brown, Yan Lu, Sugata Ray  and Melvyn Teo, began with a hypothesis about a psychological trait called “sensation seeking. ” As they write, the trait is “defined by the seeking of varied, novel, complex, and intense sensations and experiences, and the willingness to take physical, social, legal, and financial risks for the sake of such experience. ” Major sensation seekers, in other words, are the sort of people who probably make for good Hollywood protagonists, and they are more likely to step outside the law. Among other correlates established by earlier research, people with the trait are less careful with spending and engage in risky driving. So when their disposable incomes start to swell, the researchers reasoned, they are more likely to stop by a Ferrari showroom than a Subaru lot. The study’s authors reason that   managers make for perfect subjects for observing the upsides and downsides of being a sensation seeker, since they work in a relatively unconstrained sector of the finance industry, where personal tendencies towards risk and crime are less likely to be reined in by regulation or norms, as well as more likely to show up in   records and mandatory disclosures of past violations. But the researchers theorize that the same would be true of other finance professionals who make investment decisions, though it may be less pronounced. It’s important to clarify that investing is inherently risky, and that there is such a thing as good risk, versus bad risk. For instance, if one can afford to, it’s rational to bet on a   chance that pays out more than double. But the researchers found that the    managers are more likely to take bad risks their   strategies don’t produce greater rewards. Quite the opposite, Brown and co. write: We find that hedge fund managers who own powerful sports cars take on more investment risk. Conversely, managers who own practical but unexciting cars take on less investment risk. The incremental risk taking by performance car buyers does not translate to higher returns   …     In addition, performance car owners are more likely to terminate their funds, engage in fraudulent behavior, load up on   stocks . .. and succumb to overconfidence. The data show that the returns from investments made under   managers who drive sports cars are about 17 percent more volatile than returns from ones who don’t have sports cars. These people trade in big sums these numbers mean millions. An even more instructive finding comes from the data on the correlation between car type and violations reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). According to disclosures that traders are required to file with the government,   owners are 17. 3 percent more likely to have committed an SEC violation than are other car owners. On the other extreme, minivan drivers are a full 44. 6 percent likelier than the rest to have a clean record. To be glib, fraudsters like roadsters. One of the things the researchers worried could skew their results is the subjects’ possible biases towards particular car companies. If   tend to buy a certain brand, and that brand happens to make lots of   with high horsepower, then the results would reflect the automakers’ characteristics, not the investors’. The study contains an analysis of the data controlling for these potential   biases —  say, against a dowdier automaker (like Volvo) or towards one could that makes lots of peppy sports cars (the paper mentions BMW, though Porsche is a more likely culprit). Yet the findings hold when controlling for this possible bias, among other potential confounding variables. One quibble automotive enthusiasts may have with the study’s methodology is how it distinguishes between performance cars and   cars. Like any good study, this one sets out an objective definition for the things it measures. But the way it defines performance cars, looking for   with big power and torque numbers to see if they correlate with undesirable investing behavior, doesn’t map all that well on to the array of fast automotive offerings currently available to the   managers of the world. Now happens to be a golden age for high performance  . A decade ago, only the clunky and exotic Maserati Quattroporte filled a market niche that Porsche, Aston Martin, and even Dodge, with its Charger Hellcat, now compete in. So while “I know it when I see it” makes a bad legal definition of smut because it’s too subjective, it would be fascinating to see the study conducted based on a definition of “performance car” derived from polling the opinions of a group of automotive journalists and car obsessives. It seems likely the study’s results would be even more pronounced. Still, regardless of exactly how the cars are categorized, the lesson is clear. Before putting their trust in financial professionals, consumers should find out what those professionals drive."
’Repeal and Delay’ Won’t Prevent Obamacare Repeal Chaos,Atlantic,Vann R. Newkirk II,2017-01-04,"Over the next few weeks, Republicans will probably vote to repeal Obamacare. Though Republicans and vice   Mike Pence are huddling to come up with replacement plans, the general framework of action over the immediate term seems clear. Republicans will likely delay its   so as to not immediately cancel millions of plans and “create a transition and bridge so that no one is left out in the cold,” as per Speaker Ryan. Barring defections, Democrats have little power to stop them. There’s one big problem with this approach, however. While the “repeal and delay” tactic seems like a way to keep people from becoming suddenly uninsured or having to make inconvenient changes —  or to keep kicking the can down the road —  in reality the mere announcement of a   repeal or pledge to end government support for   markets could cause severe disruptions in how those markets operate. And those disruptions could mean turmoil for millions of people. Obama: The Ocean President  The secondary currency of any insurance market is risk —  or the amount plans can be expected to pay in claims for each beneficiary. Originally, insurers hedged against risk by finding healthy patients and charging sicker patients more or denying them coverage altogether. Obamacare effectively eliminated many of those hedges by creating qualifying health plans, by removing lifetime spending caps, and by prohibiting companies from refusing to insure based on   conditions bans. In order to make the health plans work work and entice health insurance companies to participate in the health insurance exchanges, Obamacare mandates healthier people to join and offset sicker people’s costs, and also uses federal money to offsetting risky bets in several different ways. Those shopping for plans on the exchanges are often inherently risky bets, and only federal funding and the promise of more such funding in the future keeps insurers insuring them. Even in 2016 before Donald Trump’s presidency became viable and the threat of an Obamacare repeal became real, the exchanges had grown increasingly unstable and brittle. The administration had difficulty in attracting younger, healthier people to sign up, so enrollees were sicker and riskier than expected. Although stakeholders expected risk to be high as the country adjusted to a   healthcare paradigm and the individual mandate pushed stragglers into exchanges, Congress later authorized lower payments than expected to offset that risk. The   premium increases of exchange plans and the withdrawal of major insurers like Aetna were signs of this inherent instability. Although they are certainly fixable problems, fixing them requires money, which requires action by Congress. Though some of this instability can be attributed to hype from insurers seeking to maximize government subsidies and payments to offset risk, several firms do run in the red now with the expectation that they’ll be in good position to make money when the market settles down. What’s the incentive for them to continue to insure people if they believe the market will no longer exist —  or if they believe that the tax credits in a Republican replacement plan are less than what they receive now? Insurance plans have to decide by May of 2017 if they’ll participate in the exchanges, and it might not be a surprise to see insurers with smaller enrollee bases or higher losses bow out. Also, those plans that do stay can pass on the costs of increased uncertainty in the markets in the form of increased premiums, which would cost the federal government and enrollees even more money. At MarketWatch, former   executive J. B. Silvers explains how this might all work in practice: Some in Congress seem to think that passing the “repeal” part immediately but delaying its implementation for two or three years will somehow leave everything as it is now. But this naive notion misses the fact that the riskiness of the Obamacare individual insurance exchange markets will have been ramped up to such a level that continuing makes no sense. Even if a company reaches   in the “delay” years, it will lose when the repeal is effective. If the premium subsidies now available to   enrollees go away immediately and the mandate to sign up for an insurance plan disappears, then the number of people purchasing individual policies on the exchanges will drop like a rock. In fact, it is clear that even debating this scenario is likely to be   since insurers must decide on their participation for 2018 by the late spring of 2017. Look for many to leave then. A plan to repeal and delay would also likely have some effects on the individual mandate to purchase insurance. If that plan immediately eliminates the mandate, the final lever to maintain the health of exchange risk pools evaporates, and there will be much less impetus for healthier, younger people to participate in them. Even if the plan phases the mandate out over time, news of a repeal might be easily misconstrued as eliminating the mandate, which could still spur millions of healthy people to leave the exchanges and penalize them at tax time next year for doing so. At the same time, even the rumor of a repeal can send millions of sicker people into the exchanges to receive some kind of vital services before the well runs dry, which are bound by law to cover them. In fact, this may already have happened. As long as an indefinite purgatory between repeal and replacement exists, adverse selection will be impossible to fix, as would be the “death spiral. ” The   scenario would be the   withdrawal of insurers from markets and the inversion of risk pyramids, with sicker and sicker patients seeking coverage while they can. Without available insurers or a public option, people without employer coverage or who make too much to qualify for Medicaid might just not have any insurance to buy. If Congress and state governments don’t actively enforce “rate review” and   ratio rules that give states oversight over large premium increases and mandate that insurance plans spend a certain percentage of premiums on healthcare, insurers could enter markets that don’t have plans and raise premiums for vulnerable people who need insurance most. Alternatively,   insurers —  which already profit on the mandate despite providing barebones services that don’t qualify as full plans —  could continue to fill in the gaps. Millions of people in the exchanges may have to change insurance or enter the ranks of the uninsured. And though the delay may not immediately affect people with employer coverage or public coverage, downstream challenges for insurers in exchanges could affect the products they offer for those markets. None of this would be good politically for Republicans, who already have to contend with a voter base that actually kind of likes having insurance. Compare that scenario to the political damage that Democrats suffered in the 2016 elections over much less dire and   problems. Republicans could pin these woes on Obamacare itself, but then their inability to fix those woes despite campaigning on promises to do just that could come back to haunt them. As conservative   American Enterprise Institute reports, the fact that Republicans are aware of the destabilizing effect that a delay might cause and intend to build a reform in increments indicates that there isn’t really a plan in place. But the longer the delay goes, the more political capital will have to be expended in fixing the issues that it causes. A piecemeal plan with a delay could also exacerbate the instabilities in the marketplace, and continue to widen gaps in the current healthcare system. The market risk grows with each day without a clear picture of what comes next, and many people who have children, lose jobs, lose spouses or have other serious life events in the interim will be placed at the mercy of a volatile market, where   plans might evaporate, subsidies may suddenly dry up, or death spirals may collapse entire markets altogether. What comes next for them?"
How Design Thinking Became a Buzzword at School,Atlantic,Jessica Lahey,2017-01-04,"At a recent teaching conference in Richmond, Virginia, a session on “design thinking” in education drew a capacity crowd. Two   teachers demonstrated how they had used the concept to plan and execute an   project in which students were asked to develop a hypothetical city or town given factors such as population, geography, the environment, and financial resources. The teachers in the audience were enchanted by the details of the project and if the photographs in the presentation were any indication, the students who participated in the lesson enjoyed it, too. The presenting teachers were bubbling over with enthusiasm for what they saw as the potential inherent in teaching design thinking. Many of the teachers in attendance were flummoxed, however. As we filed out of the room and headed toward our next sessions, I overheard one woman remark to another that while the   project looked like something she’d like to try in her own classroom, “I think I missed something. I still don’t understand what design thinking is. Do you?” The other teacher shook her head and said, “I think it’s a curriculum, but I’m not really sure. ” The Common   Tool That’s Banned in College, Confusion around the precise definition of design thinking is understandable, said Neil Stevenson, the executive portfolio director at IDEO Chicago, one of the   purveyors of design thinking. “Design thinking isn’t one thing,” he told me in a phone interview, “but a bundle of mindsets and philosophies all wrapped up in one term, which obviously has the potential to lead to ambiguity and misunderstanding. ” While Stevenson spent plenty of time talking around a definition —  explaining mindsets, the nature of creativity, and the evolution of design —  even convincing him to offer a brief definition proved difficult. Finally, Stevenson outlined what he sees as the foundational aspects of design thinking as it relates to educators: First, he emphasized, design thinking starts with empathy. When designing anything meant to be used by another person —  whether that’s a lesson, curriculum, classroom layout, or an imaginary city —  the designer must understand what that person (an “” in design lingo) needs. In the case of the   project, for example, the students can’t just design a pretty building they must think about the needs of the people who will live there, as well as the available resources, the budget, and the impact that building will have on the surrounding landscape. “The   philosophy requires the designer to put his or her ego to the side and seek to meet the unmet needs, both rational and emotional, of the user,” Stevenson explained. Once the student designers have gathered all their research together, they must organize and make sense of it all. Again, in the case of the   project, after the students have gathered interviews and research about the needs of their city’s future residents, students must figure out what to do with all that information. If, for example, the future residents’ top priorities include affordability and opulence, the student designer is going to have to find a way to integrate the residents’ conflicting needs. Finally, design thinking requires designers to generate ideas —  lots of ideas —  and prototype them. In order for this part of the process to work, students and teachers must be comfortable with failure. For many students, particularly those who want to look smart, this phase can be frustrating. “People tend to come up with an idea early on, and know that this idea is it, the perfect idea, and get emotionally invested in that one thing. Then, when their perfect idea fails, they fall apart,” Stevenson said. Design thinking forces students to keep their minds open, to try out lots of ideas early in the process before they let their egos or emotions get too invested in just one. There will be a time to put spitballing aside, of course. Once ideas have been prototyped and tested, students begin to work toward one effective, final solution —  an end product that can be assessed, presented, displayed, or put to work in their classroom or community. The beauty of the design process, proponents say, is that the value of the experience does not lie solely in the end product. Learning happens throughout the process, from the early research phase to the final presentation. This allows students and teachers to focus on what’s most important in learning: the process, rather than the product. One scene from the film Apollo 13 provides a great illustration of the   process. After Apollo 13 is crippled by an explosion, the astronauts are stranded in the lunar module. The air filters in the lunar module are failing, so the engineers at NASA must find a way to make a square filter fit into a round hole using only the materials available to the astronauts. The engineers find a solution through design thinking: by understanding the needs and resources of the astronauts, organizing the resources available on the lunar module, then working together to develop and prototype many ideas. The ultimate solution may not have been pretty, but it was creative and it was effective. Their design saved the lives of the Apollo 13 astronauts. This sort of    formulaic approach to creative   was revolutionary and counterintuitive when it was first developed in reaction to the launch of Sputnik in 1957. When Russia leapfrogged ahead of the rest of the world in the space race, the U. S. needed to respond with a rapid and radical acceleration in technological innovation. The process of design thinking emerged as an effort to encourage all scientists —  even the least creative, most inflexible thinkers —  to be novel, brave, and innovative in their  . Historically, creativity has been portrayed as a mysterious, elusive force —  a gift from the gods or the muses. Creativity can’t be summoned, the thinking goes, let alone taught to the mentally inflexible, unimaginative,   masses. Design thinking upends that perception and assumes that anyone can be a creative  . At its best, design thinking incorporates   teaching techniques such as   inquiry and collaborative   and dovetails nicely with   learning curricula that emphasize interpersonal skills such as collaboration and empathy. And the end result of a   project is often a tangible product, such as a model city, a robot, or a better mousetrap.  It’s no surprise, then, that many educators are eager to adopt design thinking as a way to plan their own teaching and as a strategy for helping their students learn through solving   problems. The popularity of design thinking, however, might be precisely what’s contributing to the confusion I witnessed in Virginia, says Stevenson: It’s been extremely gratifying for all of us practicing design to see the ideas taken on by so many people. There’s a downside, though, which is that when something becomes popular, now suddenly everyone wants to learn it and lots and lots of people will spring up and teach it. For the sake of communication, we tend to define design thinking as A followed by B followed by C, but in doing this, we are guilty of oversimplifying. As teachers seek to learn more about design thinking and its application in their classrooms, conference sessions and certificate programs have emerged to accommodate demand. Stanford’s   and IDEO offer two popular courses, but there are many flavors, colors, and brands of design thinking for educators to choose from. In other words, the lack of a clear definition makes explaining, evaluating, and studying design thinking a challenge. And some teachers at that conference in Virginia —  myself included —  were skeptical, and attended the   session to better understand whether the concept is actually an effective learning strategy or simply another education trend gone viral despite scant objective data regarding its effectiveness for learning. When executed with a clear understanding of its purpose as a method for fostering empathy, creativity, and innovation, design thinking can be a powerful tool for learning and change. If it is hastily and inexpertly implemented by educators with a weak or incomplete understanding of its principles, however, it is likely to be a waste of energy and precious classroom time. Design thinking, like Carol Dweck’s work on fixed and growth mindsets and Angela Duckworth’s research on grit, are best understood in context, as a complex and nuanced approach to learning rather than a checklist of executable tasks. Dweck was so alarmed by the rampant oversimplification of fixed and growth mindsets that she wrote an article for Edutopia to clear up common misconceptions about her work. Just as Dweck’s work can’t be conveyed adequately in a Life Hack infographic, and Duckworth’s research is apt to be misunderstood when reduced to a listicle, design thinking seems likely to fail as an educational tool when communicated in terms of “Five Simple Steps. ” Mindsets, grit, and design thinking are all victims of their own massive popularity, and in the rush to incorporate these concepts into existing lesson plans, have sometimes been reduced to checklist items on teachers’ overcrowded   lists. When treated as a classroom culture, however, rather than an action, design thinking (as well as mindset and grit) may revolutionize the way teachers and students think about failure, creative   and teamwork. Ultimately, design thinking is not a curriculum, advocates like Stevenson say, but a process for   a strategy to elicit creativity rooted in empathy and comfort with failure. Teachers can use design thinking to create a classroom layout that conforms to the needs of their students, they say, or to plan lessons that will work best for the students in a given school or classroom. Entire school districts are embracing design thinking to create spaces and curricula around the intellectual and emotional needs of their students. Teachers are also helping students use design thinking to apply what they’ve learned to   problems, such as the   project described by those   teachers in Virginia. While there is not a lot of data to support any particular brand of design thinking as an effective teaching or learning strategy, the key elements of design thinking will be familiar to any teacher   in the basics of effective teaching: start with empathy, move ego to the side, and support students in the process of failing often and early on their way to learning."
Obama: The Ocean President ,Atlantic,Ed Yong,2017-01-04,"In August 1961, Barack Obama was born in Honolulu, Hawaii, thousands of miles from the American mainland. He spent 14 of his first 18 years on those islands, bodysurfing off Sandy Beach Park, surrounded by the expansive blue of the Pacific. He later moved inland, to Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, and eventually the White House. But he never lost his childhood connection to the sea. When he leaves the Oval Office this month, he will have safeguarded more of the ocean than any other president, and increased the amount of protected waters around the U. S. by four times.* His administration has also worked to improve American fisheries, clamp down on illegal fishing, and create national policies for protecting the oceans. Such measures are vital at a time when the oceans are imperiled by many threats, including overfishing, acidification, pollution, and climate change. “We don’t see the effects of climate change every single day with our own eyes,” Obama said last September, at a State Department conference in Washington, D. C. “We just see this great, big ocean —  we assume that it’s too big to be wrecked.  It’s easy, as a consequence, to dismiss the urgency of the challenge. ” “When you look at what he has done in terms of ocean protection, it’s really remarkable, and partly because it was so unexpected,” says Jean Flemma, a former policy advisor at the U. S. House of Representatives. “When Obama was elected, he was known for being good on environmental issues. But I don’t think anyone thought at the outset: Here’s the president who’s going to be the ocean president. ” “This administration has made the ocean a centerpiece for international diplomacy,” says Jane Lubchenco, a marine ecologist and former administrator of NOAA. “They used to be out of sight, out of mind. The only people who would talk about ocean issues were science ministers or fishery ministers. Now, when the President talks to other heads of state, oceans are often on the agenda. ” “People tend to make issues like this partisan,” she adds. But many of Obama’s actions to improve ocean health “have their roots in previous Republican administrations and have strong bipartisan support in Congress. ” And Obama himself took a while to wet his conservation feet. In January 2013, the Center for American Progress criticized him for having protected less public land than any of the four preceding presidents, and for having leased 2. 5 times as much acreage to oil and gas companies for drilling. Since then, there’s been a dramatic  . Under Obama’s administration, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has expanded several marine sanctuaries, and created the first new ones in 15 years. He himself has created or expanded several national monuments using the Antiquities Act —  a 1906 law passed by Teddy Roosevelt, which allows presidents to unilaterally protect areas of land without congressional approval. Obama has used this power 29 times, most recently to create the Bears Ears and Gold Butte monuments just last week. These, and most of the other monuments, are on land. But the biggest ones, by far, are in the ocean. In September 2014, Obama took the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument, which George W. Bush had created five years earlier, and expanded it  . The monument comprises seven disparate U. S.  islands and atolls. It’s a bustling haven for sharks, groupers, whales, dolphins, turtles, and seabirds, and is now completely closed off to drilling, mining, and commercial (but not recreational) fishing. Covering 490, 000 square miles, it’s three times the size of California, and bigger than all the   national parks combined. For two years, it was the world’s largest marine reserve, until Obama smashed his own record in August 2016. Working off another Bush legacy, he quadrupled the size of Hawaii’s Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument to 583, 000 square miles —  twice the size of Texas. The area houses over 7, 000 marine species including many found nowhere else in the world. Among them are the endangered Hawaiian monk seal, a ghostly octopus dubbed Casper, and a newly discovered fish named Tosanoides obama. Animals aside, the monument also contains the wrecks of five aircraft carriers that were sunk during World War II, and what Native Hawaiians see as a boundary between the living world and the spiritual one. “Obama not only conserved a really unique ecosystem, but also a part of our history, and an area with very important cultural links,” says Kris Sarri who works at the Department of the Interior. In September, Obama added the first marine monument in the Atlantic. Situated off the coast of Cape Cod, the    zone includes   corals and   sperm whales, three underwater canyons that are deeper than the Grand Canyon, and four dormant undersea volcanoes that are taller than the Appalachians.   Obama has been even busier in the final months of his term. In October, he was reportedly instrumental in persuading a reticent Chinese government to join the U. S. and 23 other governments in setting up the world’s largest marine protected area in the Ross Sea off Antarctica. In December, as my colleague Robinson Meyer reported, he established an “indefinite” ban on oil and gas drilling in virtually the entire   stretch of the Arctic Ocean, as well as parts of the Atlantic. In the same month, he created a 112, 000 square mile “climate resilience area” off the west coast of Alaska —  a region that hosts vast numbers of migrating mammals like bowhead whales, belugas, and walruses. His executive order maintains bans against   fishing, adds partials prohibitions against oil and gas exploration, and gives indigenous Native Alaskan communities a greater voice in managing the area. “Any time you are willing to set aside an area for the health of the environment, it’s an act of courage,” says Jeff Watters, director of government relations at the Ocean Conservancy. “Conservation will always make people upset. But the choices that Obama and Bush made were made after extensive public comment and feedback. It’s not like they just came in the dead of midnight. ” Indeed, after protests from fishing groups, Obama decided to allow lobster and red crab fisheries to operate in the Atlantic monument for seven more years. He also pulled back on creating a second monument at the kelp forests of Cashes Ledge in New England. For many critics, that’s not enough. They argue that the Antiquities Act, and the monuments that result from it, represent a gross overreach of Executive Branch authority. Rob Bishop, a Utah representative and chairman of the House Committee on Natural Resources, described it as “the most evil Act ever invented” to a group of land managers. “If anyone here likes the Antiquities Act the way it is written, die,” he added. He and others have repeatedly tried to weaken the act, or repeal it entirely. Such complaints aren’t new. A miner challenged the Antiquities Act in 1920, claiming that Roosevelt had overstepped the mark in establishing a large chunk of the Grand Canyon as a monument. The Supreme Court unanimously ruled in Roosevelt’s favor, and in doing so, set an important precedent. But some say the time is right to set a new one, and are looking to Donald Trump to make the historic move of revoking existing monuments once he takes office. Speaking to The Salt Lake Tribune, Bishop said that he had had “positive and encouraging” talks with the Trump transition team about this. “However, some legal analyses have concluded that the Antiquities Act does not authorize the President to repeal proclamations, and that the President also lacks implied authority to do so,” wrote Alexandra Wyatt, an attorney at the Congressional Research Service. Or, as my colleague Robinson Meyer said, “The president can giveth land to conservation, but he or she cannot taketh it away. ” Any attempt to do so would likely meet lengthy legal challenges. Trump might not have any appetite for such battles. Earlier this year, he told CBS News that he doesn’t like the idea of handing federal lands to states. “I want to keep the lands great, and you don’t know what the state is going to do,” he said. “This is magnificent land. And we have to be great stewards of this land. ” Speaking to  Field  Stream magazine, he said, “I am for energy exploration, as long as we don’t do anything to damage the land. And right now we don’t need too much —  there’s a lot of energy. ” And in a   speech, he claimed that he would follow the legacy of Theodore Roosevelt and “conserve and protect our beautiful natural resources for the next generation, including protecting lands. ” Such promises will ultimately count for little if his administration maintains its denial of climate change.   carbon emissions are warming and making the oceans more acidic if the U. S. reneges on its commitment to reducing such emissions, marine life will eventually suffer. But in the short term, protected waters can help its residents to cope with climate change, by removing extra stresses like drilling, fishing, and noise pollution. “We have good evidence that protected areas are more resilient and recover faster,” says Lubchenco. That’s good news for people who depend on the sea for their livelihood. In sanctuaries and monuments, depleted populations of fish can recover, grow, and reproduce. “Fish aren’t like mammals as females get bigger, they make lots more eggs, so if you allow fish to get big and old, you get a lot more babies,” explains Rebecca Goldburg, director of ocean science at the Pew Charitable Trusts. And since those babies can travel over long distances, protected areas act as conveyor belts that continually seed nearby fisheries with fresh stock. Historically, most of the ocean was effectively protected, by dint of being remote and inaccessible. Now, our technology allows us to fish, mine, and drill everywhere. And the sad truth is that even the unprecedentedly large areas that Obama has protected, combined with similar reserves set up by other nations, comprise just a few percent of the total ocean. It’s a dramatic increase from a decade ago, but still “just a drop in the bucket,” says Lubchenco. “Scientists think we’ll need upwards of 30 percent. ” “While it is our oceans’ contours that shape our coastlines, it is what we decide and do here that will shape our oceans’ future,” Obama once said. “I spent my childhood on those shores, looking out over the endless ocean, and was humbled by it. And I know that, in a contest between us and the oceans, eventually the oceans will win one way or the other.  So it’s us that has to adapt.  Not the other way around. ” *  This article originally stated that Obama “increased the amount of protected waters around the U. S. by 20 times,” which is true for the continental U. S. The increase for the nation’s waters, however, is just  . We regret the error."
Mistakes in ’Paleo’ Eating ,Atlantic,James Hamblin,2017-01-04,"Advertising is screaming at us: New year, new you. New, new, new. Everything will be better when it’s new. The old you was probably great, but it’s harder to sell things to people who honestly believe that. The most common January undertaking in that quest is dietary —  shifting the actual molecules that fuel everything we do. Most of us will fail to meaningfully change, and then feel only more inadequate in that failure. We fail because absurd goals can never be maintained, and because sometimes our own bodies (partly the way we were born, but mostly the way we’ve trained them to demand constant supplies of simple carbohydrates and insulin) make it almost impossible not to fail —  to live without feeling deprived and hungry and joyless. Maybe most importantly, many people fail when they don’t truly believe in what they’re doing. The gratification of sugar is immediate, and the idea of a paralyzing stroke decades hence is remote. It seems there are more important things to worry about right now. One solution might be to think beyond yourself. I’m reminded of that because this week the good people at Bon Appetit magazine tweeted a story under the headline “Don’t Make These Common Mistakes When Going Paleo. ” (Tell me I’m making mistakes, and I will click every time.) The “Paleo” approach to eating is, in brief, using evolutionary history to inform consumption. Some mistakes described in the article differed from what I think are the most important to consider —  for Paleo or most any diet. Their first piece of advice is to avoid eating too much saturated fat. That’s a contentious claim packed into a paragraph of a culinary magazine. Books have been written on the subject, and many nutrition experts have come to disagree that the weight of evidence supports limiting saturated fat. (Within reason —  don’t test them and try to subsist on lard alone.) The Paleo movement itself arose in step with the realization over the past two decades that saturated fat had been wrongly blamed by some experts as the central dietary culprit in heart disease. While other experts disagree that saturated fat intake should be unlimited (and some research has found that substituting polyunsaturated fats can be beneficial) it’s unclear to many that strict limits are prudent. I’m not convinced it’s worthwhile for most people to think about saturated fat at all —  to avoid it or to gorge on it. So here are what I see as more pressing mistakes related to Paleo, and the opportunities that those mistakes present. Eating in a way that’s not sustainable for the planet, Speaking of packing entire books into one paragraph:   animal agriculture has become a primary driver of climate change. We are eating and producing much more meat than ever before. The human population is on pace to hit 10 billion by the middle of the century that’s 10 times as many people as there were in 1800. When we find a way to grow delicious red meat in petri dishes, then we can discuss exactly how much is healthy to eat. For now, the only way forward for our species seems to be to consider meat as something closer to a delicacy. Forgetting fiber, Of all the “probiotics” on the market, one of the few with actual evidence that it serves our microbes well is plant fiber. Fiber is the carbohydrate that humans can’t digest, yet we’ve long known that people who eat   diets tend to be healthier. Among multiple studies with similar results, one with 40, 000 subjects found that a   diet came with a   lower than average risk of heart disease. Fiber also seems to protect against metabolic syndrome. One of the mechanisms behind these benefits appears to be that fiber essentially feeds the microbes in our guts, encouraging diverse populations. Those microbes are implicated in a vast array of illnesses and wellbeing. A diet heavy on meat and dairy is necessarily lower on fiber.   In that light, the idea of “ ” is an interesting one. Loosely defined, it could mean eating minimally processed,   diets. If a flaw in veganism is that some people think they can drink juice and eat white bread all day and be healthy, that might be sustainable for the planet but not good for you.   (again, loosely defined lest we descend into madness trying to discern the plant varieties this would include) might work as a rule of thumb that generally keeps us focused on the sorts of foods that promote health. Rejecting the idea that technology can improve our lives, The basic idea behind Paleo is that humans evolved under certain circumstances over millennia, and then those circumstances changed tremendously in the last century, and our bodies did not keep pace. We find ourselves sedentary and overfed on amalgamations that distort our body’s expectations of “food. ” There’s almost no doubt these changes underlie epidemics of obesity and cardiovascular disease, but it’s easy to take that reasoning too far —  basically to adopt a worldview in which all modern food technology is evil. It seems clear that the future of health research will involve anthropological study of our history in determining how we (and our microbes) evolved to process and prosper from food, and where we’ve gone wrong in recent decades. As we come to better understand that history, it’s important not to lose focus on the fact that for all its problems, our modern food system has us living longer and less deprived than centuries past. The challenge is striking balance. Telling people all about how you’re “going Paleo” unless explicitly asked to do so, Other people’s diets are no more interesting than their sleep habits or their children. Breaking into a screed about your own diet shows contempt for the listener. It’s like talking about how you went to the dentist, or about something you were going to post on Facebook but didn’t. Being hypocritical, Take, for instance, this advice from the Bon Appetit article: It’s a   to plan a week’s worth of dinners, but don’t forget about breakfast, lunch, and snacks. Kenzie Swanhart [author of a Paleo cookbook] brings raw vegetables like carrot sticks and peppers with guacamole to work. She’s also a fan of homemade plantain chips and   granola bars. Those all sound like fine things to eat, but the philosophy behind them is disjointed. The “ ” part is based on the idea that our bodies didn’t evolve to eat grains (which were not a significant part of human diets before the dawn of agriculture).   books have also been written about this, citing evidence selectively. But more compelling to me, whole grains have consistently shown to be parts of the diets of the   healthiest people. (Also is it a   to plan a week’s worth of dinners?) If you choose to avoid grains because they weren’t part of an ancestral diet, then it’s difficult to justify any granola bars, plantain chips, and guacamole. Unless you can point to some ancient people who ate all three of those things.  The point is, if you’re going to go around talking about “going Paleo” for whatever reason —  ritual,   adventure —  it’s strange to be militantly inflexible about rules that are barely more than arbitrary. Lacking a meaningful reason for what you’re doing, Changing the way we eat is a major change. It will involve multiple decisions every day. Presumably our old habits existed for reasons —  convenience, enjoyment, availability, cost, marketing, etc. Modifying the habits that these conditions created means hard work and requires dedication to a cause. I’m not convinced that concern for the health of our bodies years in the future is sufficient. I’m not even sure the promise of modifying our appearances is enough. The neurologist Viktor Frankl wrote in Man’s Search for Meaning that the key is to avoid the temptation to pursue happiness —  like that being sold to us through all of the   deals —  but to pursue meaning. Piles of research have shown that a sense of purpose is a central to long, healthy life. There’s purpose to be had in how we eat —  in how conscientious we can be, how minimally we can disrupt the world for those that will come after us and those working to produce and procure our food. I think this is a sustainable and worthy resolution for a healthier way to eat, if you’re intent on making one. It works for the mind and body at once, and, most importantly, not just our own."
The Republicans Who Want Trump to Fight Climate Change,Atlantic,Kate Aronoff,2017-01-04,"Not everyone interested in curbing climate change is tearing their hair out about Donald Trump’s election. Though the   seems to be packing his administration with climate deniers and fossil fuel industry veterans, a small, unconventional band of environmentalists sees potential. “We hope,” says Bob Inglis, “that Donald Trump sees an opportunity to complete the sentence this way: Richard Nixon went to China, Bill Clinton signed welfare reform, and Donald Trump did climate change. ” In the last several years, Inglis —  a former Congressman from South Carolina —  has emerged as a spokesperson of sorts for “the ” a suite of think tanks, activists and politicos making the case for a   approach to environmentalism, grounded in conservative values. He now serves as the Executive Director of RepublicEn, a small advocacy outfit of   “energy optimists,” keen to dispel rumors that the GOP is the province of climate denialism. Inglis’s optimism notwithstanding,   activists have ample reason to fear a Trump administration. The  ’s pick to run the EPA has spent years challenging the agency in court. And his Secretary of State nominee, the former ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson, could green light new   pipelines like the Keystone XL, along with new partnerships between oil companies from Houston to Moscow. A previously squashed $500 billion Arctic oil deal between Exxon and Rosneft, a   Russian oil firm, might well be on the table again if Trump lifts   sanctions against the country. For Inglis and his colleagues at RepublicEN, though, the cabinet picks causing other greens to lose sleep have been welcome additions. “If Rex Tillerson led Exxon Mobil away from the disputation of climate science, perhaps he can lead the Administration away from disputation too,” Inglis says, and he takes Tillerson’s support for a carbon tax as an encouraging sign. When it comes to climate action, Inglis adds, the “environmental left” —  encompassing everyone from Al Gore to   activists —  have been steering the conversation about climate change for too long. It’s time to “let ExxonMobil drive,” he says. Inglis might seem out of step with the climate movement’s increasingly   bent, defined by efforts like   divestment and the battle against the Dakota Access pipeline. But members of the   see little contradiction between   companies’   and a   future. Like other members of the   Inglis believes that efficient markets are the ultimate problem solver, and he has a general skepticism about all but the most basic of regulations. “The essence of [the  ] is all about internalizing negative externalities,” Inglis says, referencing the hidden expenses of carbon’s seepage into the atmosphere. He says that polluters are “socializing their soot and climate costs. ” By making them pay and stripping out all energy subsidies, the thinking goes, firms will shift their business models accordingly, weeding out wasteful fuels, making the Paris Agreement and Obama’s Clean Power Plan superfluous. “Our view of the Clean Power Plan is that it’s precisely the worst way to deal with climate change,” Inglis explains. UN agreements and regulatory pushes, Inglis argues, represent the kind of policies which keep conservatives out of the conversation on climate, because they are both too complicated and too confrontational. “I think the path in is mostly through the business community, where unlikely partners could really step forward and say, ‘There’s a free enterprise solution to this. Don’t give us regulations. Don’t try to tell us how to run our business. Just internalize the negative externality and we will deal with it,’” he says. The holy grail of Inglis’s brand of   is a “   ” carbon tax. This kind of pricing mechanism offers a more elegant solution to the   than the patchwork of regulations involved in Obama’s landmark climate rule, wherein each state arrives at its own plan. Greens across the political spectrum have long backed versions of a carbon tax as part of a broader slate of   policies, some proposals for which would see dividends given out directly to taxpayers or put toward investments in clean energy. What’s unique about the   position on the tax is their view that it should act as the centerpiece of a climate plan, as opposed to one component among many   and regulatory measures. In contrast, when Bernie Sanders and his “environmental left” ilk advocate for pricing carbon, they tend also to favor putting hard limits on polluters’ ability to spit greenhouse gases into the air. Key, too, to the   is swapping a carbon tax out for others —  say income or corporate taxes —  rather than adding the revenue to government coffers. “You put a tax on things that you want less of,” Inglis says, while allowing the price signal to drive   firms toward natural gas and renewable energy. Importers to the U. S. would also be forced to account for the carbon costs of goods produced abroad. Carbon taxes don’t have the best track record. Norway set a reasonably high carbon tax way back in 1991, yet the country’s emissions fell by just 2. 3 percent from 1990 to 1999. In British Columbia, where a tax was implemented in 2008, modest emissions reductions have been traced back to the fallout from the Great Recession rather than the tax itself. It’s not clear how a new tax would affect corporate behavior. Oil majors have been factoring the likelihood of a price on carbon into their   financial planning for some time. Exxon first started accounting for a tax in 2007, setting its estimations for a price as high as $80 per ton in some regions. The company’s own spokesperson told the Houston Chronicle in 2016 that curbing warming to a 1. 6 degree target —  “well below two degrees,” per the Paris Agreement’s text —  would drive the cost of carbon up to $2000 per ton, far beyond the level set out in any proposal currently on the table. A failed carbon tax measure in Washington state, for example, would have started the tax at just $10 per ton in 2017, and gradually scaled up to $100 by  . Among the countries already taxing carbon, Australia’s fee is the equivalent of $23 per metric ton. Chile’s will be set at just $5 per ton when it takes effect in 2018, and apply to just 55 percent of emissions. Sweden has one of the highest carbon prices at $150 per ton. It doesn’t apply, however, to the country’s electric power providers, and major industries pay about half of the standard tax. Exxon’s Alan Jeffers affirmed the company’s commitment to a   carbon tax in an email to The Atlantic. Among the state and federal proposals the company had studied, Jeffers wrote, “The most significant common shortcoming is their failure to   existing greenhouse gas regulations. The   issue is important because a   carbon tax that replaces the existing regime of emissions regulations would be a beneficial policy rationalization. ” In simpler terms, an   carbon tax shouldn’t just avoid regulations. It should dismantle them, and place as little strain as possible on the company’s operations. Exxon has gone so far as to back the Paris Agreement and its ambitious warming target. Even so, regulatory caps on warming —  and strict ones at that —  may be the only path to meeting them. A recent study from Oil Change International estimates that nearly 70 percent of   coal, oil and natural gas reserves —  not counting the ones   firms are keen to start mining —  have to stay buried in perpetuity for a reasonable chance of limiting warming to 2 degrees celsius, the “guardrail” of acceptable warming that the international community agreed to in Paris. To do that, the historical record seems to favor regulatory action over price signals alone. In contrast to British Columbia’s 5. 3 percent reduction   Ontario’s climate plan was able to scale down emissions by nearly twenty percent over a similar time frame. In large part, they did it by phasing out and then banning   power plants. Asked if climate policy might need to pose a threat to oil industry profits at some point, Inglis suggested that threat would come instead from Tesla, Elon Musk’s luxury electric car company. Inglis reasons that if fossil fuels truly are inefficient, the better product will win out on an open market. But it’s not clear that Tesla will win in the mass market any time soon. The Model 3, the company’s first “mass market” car, intended to be more affordable than its others, will be released next year and start at $35, 000. More than 56 percent of American families, meanwhile, have less than $1000 in the bank. Eli Lehrer is another member of the   looking to harness the power of the free market to save the planet. Back in 2012, Lehrer helped lead an exodus of insurance wonks out of the conservative and notoriously climate   Heartland Institute. The final straw for him at Heartland was their sponsorship of a series of billboards likening those who believe in climate change to the likes of Charles Manson and Osama bin Laden. As an insurance analyst trained to assess risk, Lehrer could no longer square his research interests with his employer’s aggressive stance against climate science. He now heads R Street, another think tank produced out of the  . Even if a carbon tax fails to bring down emissions, he says, “it’s still good tax policy. ” In 2016, the GOP’s climate politics are more complicated than they might look at first glance, with growing divides between voters and elected officials. Along with Inglis and Lehrer, 54 percent of Republicans now believe that the climate is changing and that humankind has played a hand in it. By contrast, just 14 of the 247 Republicans in the House of Representatives signed on to the Gibson Resolution, stating the urgency of climate change and the body’s commitment to addressing it. As Lehrer notes, even if Republicans’ base is starting to believe in climate change, it is still a long way off from becoming a top line issue. For Republicans, in fact, climate change was this year’s least important issue, according to Gallup. In spite of the polling, Lehrer sees   efforts at a carbon tax as “very likely in the next four to eight years. ” If there is to be progress in bringing down emissions under Trump at the federal level, though, Lehrer predicts it will come via policies that have very little to do with the climate outright. “Some of the things that the administration seems to have said it will do seem to be pretty good from a climate change perspective,” Lehrer says, “in particular  …    increased natural gas development, support for nuclear power and pipelines. ” Natural gas development, he and the American Petroleum Institute argue, has been key to bringing down emissions in the United States. Yet while natural gas emits relatively little CO2, scientists say that fracking’s low carbon cost is overshadowed by the amount of methane the process spews into the atmosphere. (As a greenhouse gas, methane is about twenty times as potent as carbon dioxide.) As for pipelines, Lehrer contends they are a safer and more   means of transporting fossil fuels, as compared to train lines. Still, building pipelines in the first place requires that there be fresh batches of oil to flow through them, which means more greenhouse gases. “Can I predict what he’s going to do? No, I don’t think anybody can,” Lehrer wrote of the   in an email to The Atlantic. “I would not be totally surprised if he were to give some speech announcing that [climate change] was a major crisis, announcing a new Manhattan Project to deal with it. And I’d be equally unsurprised if he reiterated his comment that it’s a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese. ”"
Trump Might Be Thinking About a Moon Base,Atlantic,David Brown ,2017-01-04,"Last week, upon leaving the  ’s office, Douglas Brinkley, a historian and conservationist, reported that Trump “was very interested in a man going to the moon. ” Before that point, the entirety of Trump’s utterances of space policy consisted of two sentences: “Honestly I think NASA is wonderful!” and “Right now, we have bigger problems  …     We’ve got to fix our potholes. ” Brinkley’s remark suggests he might be thinking about a moon base, an idea   by Newt Gingrich, one of Trump’s advisers. The constitution of his transition landing team at NASA, which includes lunar advocates, would seem to bear this out. The principal arguments for a moon base involve digging mines and building fuel depots. Though the moon lacks the resources to ever be truly   it only takes a few days to reach from Earth. If the U. S. decides that the goal of human spaceflight should be to gather resources, the moon and its quarry of   will be a compelling target. The isotope is extremely rare on Earth because of our magnetosphere. The moon has no such protection, and for billions of years it has collected the stuff by way of an unyielding fusillade from solar winds. There is an estimated 1. 1 million metric tons of   on the moon. A mere 40 tons could power the United States for a year if scientists are able to build a fusion reactor, we could shovel it into our nuclear power plants for centuries to come. There are also countless scientific questions that can be answered on the lunar surface. A telescope, for example, built on the far side of the moon and thus free of Earth’s ionosphere and radio interference would allow scientists to see the beginning of the universe. Chris Carberry, CEO and founder of Explore Mars, a nonprofit Mars advocacy group, argues that far greater opportunities exist on Mars, and that a return to the moon might delay Mars settlement by decades. Mars has carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen —  everything a colony needs to be  . With those ingredients, you can do everything from manufacturing plastics to cultivating the soil. In other words, you can build a base on the moon, but a civilization on Mars. Moreover, Carberry says that the red planet has never been in a better position politically, culturally, or scientifically. “Right now we have an unprecedented level of support for Mars exploration,” Carberry says. “Frankly it would be foolish to throw that away. There’s a huge amount of support on Capitol Hill. The Senate just passed a transition bill with the strongest Mars language ever put into legislation. The House did a previous authorization bill with very strong Mars language as well. There are many years of bipartisan support for Mars —  also for the moon, but the strongest emphasis is on Mars. That goes for industry as well. Boeing, Lockheed, Aerojet Rocketdyne, SpaceX, and others put quite a bit of effort into designing a mission architecture. ” American moon partisans owe a debt to Europe, which has tended the lunar flame during the ascent of Mars. Perhaps the most prominent moon advocate on Earth is Jan Woerner, the director general of the European Space Agency. Since assuming the post, he has argued persuasively that a “lunar village” is the natural successor to the aging International Space Station. It would be, in his view, a celestial point of harmony for a terrestrial species in discord. There is a problem, however: the Europeans have committed virtually no money to a moon village, and Russia, ESA’s   partner in the venture, has no money to commit. They have already been forced to downsize their presence on the ISS due to costs, and have delayed plans for robotic exploration of the moon. (The head of the Russian space agency admits that Russia “does not have financial capabilities for advanced space projects. ”) Lacking unity among member states, to say nothing of technology development and financial resources, what ESA really needs is for the United States to fund and spearhead such an effort. NASA’s sights, however, are firmly fixed on Mars. With the presidential transition, however, and a new NASA director still to be appointed, lunar champions at home and abroad see an opportunity to abandon the Journey to Mars program and set sights a little closer to the Earth. To that end, ESA is on a moon base   offensive, from the light and easy (magazine spreads and aspirational illustrations) to   politics  (publicly pressing the NASA administrator on the issue.) The overt message from Paris, where ESA is headquartered, is: We’re doing this. The subtext is: While NASA plans a fantasy mission to Mars that will never happen, the rest of the world will be driving moon buggies and mining  . But ESA’s campaign is powered by handwavium, and for all the illustrations of lunar domes and our great big blue marble over the horizon, progress on the moon base ends at Photoshop. If the U. S. doesn’t build the base, it won’t get built. Casey Dreier, the director of space policy for the Planetary Society, a nonprofit space advocacy organization, says that if any space agency really wants to land humans on the moon, let alone build a colony, there’s no getting around the commitment to a program on the order of Apollo —  a colossal commitment that ESA has not addressed.   “First you’d have to see a commitment to hardware that could get humans to the moon,” Dreier says. “Soyuz [the   spacecraft] doesn’t get to you there. ” Even if deep space hardware for   missions existed, however, there’s the more fundamental problem of actually getting it into space. “You would need a new heavy launch rocket or plans that use existing rockets for   assembly of hardware, and that’s just to get to the moon. ” (Only American rockets in development have the requisite lift.) There’s still the most challenging part of the mission: the lander. “Even more basically,” says Dreier, “ESA has to come together formally and commit votes. If there was a serious project, member nations would commit funds and decide things like: What do you do there?” The moon has always been part of NASA’s Journey to Mars program. Though landing on the lunar surface is not part of the current plan, cislunar space —  the 250, 000 miles between the Earth and the moon —  is essential. NASA calls it the “proving grounds,” and intends to develop that part of deep space to test life support and propulsion systems for any Mars expedition. Moreover, the Space Launch System (the colossal “Mars rocket” able to lift heavy payloads into space) and the Orion spacecraft for carrying astronauts into deep space are essentially holdovers from the Constellation program, the Mars space exploration initiative begun by President Bush in 2004 and canceled in 2009 by President Obama. The first stop on Constellation’s roadmap was the moon, meaning SLS and Orion, both soon to roll off the assembly line, are  . Carberry says that if we change focus to the moon, however   we should still do so in the context of going to Mars. He points to the Apollo program as a good example of how not to frame a space mission. The first time NASA went to the moon, it did so based on single reason: to beat the Soviet Union. Once that singular reason was accomplished, there will little will to maintain momentum. The   goal —  Here is what this is all building toward —  never entered the public policy discussion. “If you always have something beyond your current goal, it strengthens resolve to keep moving,” he says. “You strengthen your argument by making sure you have those   goals —  that this doesn’t stop at moon. Hopefully it won’t come to that. If we can use the surface of moon within the framework of going to Mars, and we can stimulate commercial activity there, that’s great, but if we put everything into the moon, we’ll be stuck there for decades. .. Does US want to do a moon program forever? I don’t know. Our advantage is clearly on Mars exploration. ” That advantage goes beyond national pride. NASA has been successfully landing spacecraft on Mars for 40 years. No other nation has succeeded in doing this even once. Exploring Mars is difficult, as the crashed   Schiaparelli EDM lander confirmed in October. NASA has established a cadence of Mars missions, each more complicated than the last, each developing Martian science and engineering with eventual human exploration in mind. As long as the Mars missions continue, the agency can iterate on its carefully accumulated institutional knowledge. If that knowledge is wasted and manufacturing partners spin down, the entire Mars apparatus will have to be regrown from zero. This is the same problem NASA now suffers even in its limited plan to send astronauts to cislunar space. Although SLS and Orion are very far along in development, it will still be another five years at least before a crewed mission can be attempted to lunar orbit, replicating what Apollo 8 did 50 years ago. Wherever NASA is directed to go by the new administration will likely require a commitment that pushes the alternative back by decades. There’s simply no money in the NASA budget for both the moon and Mars. As the ISS demonstrated, building the thing —  moon base or Mars colony —  is the cheap part. It’s the operational costs that bog exploration down. Twenty percent of NASA’s budget goes to keeping the space station crewed and in orbit. A moon base will entail a similar such slice of the pie, which covers things like maintenance, ground support, technicians, engineers, physicians, launches, hardware, supplies, and food. You don’t maintain a moon base and gear up for Mars. Just the opposite: Going to Mars would specifically entail closing the moon base, which places Mars on the other side of lunar exploration, base design, base construction, base operations, base maintenance, and base divestment. NASA and world partners began work on the International Space Station began during Ronald Reagan’s first term. If we build a moon village, we’ll be there for a very long time.                                                                                                                          Casey Dreier maintains that there is no correct destination for human spaceflight. “To me,” he says, “the least interesting argument in space exploration is ‘moon or Mars.’ It’s an important decision, but not an interesting argument. Mars is not objectively the only answer. The fundamental issue at play is what do we do that pays dividends as nation. ” What dividends should we look for? Elon Musk advocates Mars colonization by defining Mars as humanity’s failsafe —  that once we settle and flourish on a second world, no matter what catastrophe might befall Earth, be it an asteroid or atomic devastation, the human species can survive. NASA frames Mars exploration in more hopeful terms, calling it a scientific endeavor through which we can learn about the evolution Earth and life. Either way, those are enticing and worthy goals. Astronauts can press boot prints into Martian soil in less than 20 years, but for that to happen, NASA must stay the course."
Opening Paragraphs Don’t Always Have to Be Exciting,Atlantic,Joe Fassler,2017-01-04,"By Heart is a series in which authors share and discuss their   favorite passages in literature. See entries from Karl Ove Knausgaard, Jonathan Franzen, Amy Tan, Michael Chabon, and more. There’s a widely circulated truism that short stories should start with a   “hook,” a can’   first line that foregrounds conflict right away. (You know the kind of thing: “On the morning of the day my brother killed my father, I spent an hour unburying my truck from new snow. ”) But Emily Ruskovich, the author of Idaho, teaches her writing students not to grab at the reader so directly —  the technique, she says, tends to result in desperate, dishonest openings. In her conversation for this series, Ruskovich discussed Alice Munro’s “The Love of a Good Woman,” a novella that begins in the least flashy way possible: on the musty shelves of a local museum, with   descriptions of the objects displayed there. The dramatic plot includes a murder, a   the discovery of a body, a life destroyed by guilt —  but the narrative proceeds with great discipline, revealing its secrets carefully over time. Ruskovich explained how the story’s power, horror, and beauty derive from Munro’s restraint, and how its central image —  a red box full of optometrist’s tools —  becomes a powerful reminder of what’s missed when we move too quickly to look closely.   Like “The Love of a Good Woman,” Idaho is a murder mystery —  but the mystery is not who did it so much as so much as how, why, and with what consequence. The novel centers around Wade, an Idaho man who has lost both his daughters when his   Jenny, murdered one child, the other fled into the woods and disappeared for good. As Wade slips into dementia —  with catatonic episodes that can turn violent —  we, like his second wife, Ann, try to reconstruct, understand, and ultimately come to terms with the sorrowful events of the past. Emily Ruskovich is a graduate of the Iowa Writers’ Workshop, where she was my classmate, and was a James C. McCreight Fiction Fellow at the University of  . Her fiction has appeared in Zoetrope, One Story, and the Virginia Quarterly Review in 2015 she won an O. Henry Award for her story “Owl. ” She teaches writing at the University of   and spoke to me by phone. Emily Ruskovich: I first read Alice Munro when I was in college, and I’d never heard of her before. My professor, Deirdre McNamer, gave me a copy of her story “Runaway” —  and when I read it, I felt as if I’d been unlocked. It wasn’t that I had something in common with the character. It was that I had something in common with the story, with its very structure. Munro completely captured the mysterious way my own memory works. I remember going up to my professor, having no idea who Munro was, having only read this one story in a bad photocopy. I was just kind of concerned. I said, “I don’t understand why this woman isn’t famous. Does she know how good she is?” My teacher laughed. “She’s pretty famous,” she said. “I think she knows. ” I don’t actually recall the first time I read “The Love of a Good Woman. ” I’ve read it so many times, because I teach it in many of my classes. But every time I read the story, I find something new —  I become obsessed with some new discovery. The story is about a woman, Enid, who finds out that the husband of the sick, dying lady she cares for has committed murder. That plot, in the hands of a lesser writer, would already be interesting. But even though the plot of this story is intense —  there is murder, there is lust, there are secrets, there are many vivid, mysterious scenes —  the whole story, especially the beginning, is so quiet. And the quietness is where the story’s intensity comes from. It begins like this: For the last couple of decades, there has been a museum in Walley, dedicated to preserving photos and butter churns and horse harnesses and an old dentist’s chair and a cumbersome apple peeler and such curiosities as the pretty little    insulators that were used on telegraph poles. Also, there is a red box, which has the letters D. M. WILLENS, OPTOMETRIST printed on it, and a note beside it, saying, “This box of optometrist’s instruments though not very old has considerable local significance, since it belonged to Mr. D. M. Willens, who drowned in the Peregrine River, 1951. It escaped the catastrophe and was found, presumably by the anonymous donor, who dispatched it to be a feature of our collection. ” This opening shows such amazing restraint. Munro is so confident in her writing that she never feels the need to “grab” a reader right away, which is something I think a lot of writing teachers try to get their students to do —  advice that often results in dishonest beginnings. This idea that you’re going to lose your reader if your first paragraph doesn’t contain something really exciting —  I just think that’s false. I don’t want to be hooked or grabbed. I don’t need to be tricked into reading a story. Of course, a story does need to have some kind of tension from the first line. In this case, it’s the confidence of this mysterious voice, the assurance with which the narrator lays out these ordinary details. The mystery is: Why here? Why is this brilliant author starting the story in this seemingly straightforward way? I am grabbed by this beginning not because it is especially exciting, but because I trust Munro’s voice. If she believes that she must begin with a   description of an item in a museum, then I am fascinated by that item because she is fascinated by it, and because I sense all that she is withholding in her attempt to be honest and straightforward. I trust her absolutely, and I don’t think there is anything more important than that to a reader. Making Art at the Painful Margins, But the subdued tone here is more than stylistic. We come to discover that it is intricately tied to character, as everything in a Munro story is. If Munro feels that she wants to start a story in a very restrained way, it’s because the character shows an immense amount of restraint. And though she is not introduced until many pages into the story, restraint is the defining trait of Enid, the protagonist. She’s a nurse, which means she puts aside her needs to attend to the needs of others. Enid has this story she tells herself about who she is: She is the person who gives up what she loves because other people ask her to. It’s this romantic notion she has that seeps out of the cracks in her otherwise very restrained, very orderly and medical outlook on her life. Restraint is central, too, to the murder at the heart of the story. Rupert, the husband of the woman Enid cares for, is an extremely restrained person —  when Enid gives him a compliment about something his smart little girl said, he can’t even acknowledge her compliment, though she senses he’s pleased. He’s the kind of person who spends his life ignoring anything that is remotely emotional or uncomfortable, deflecting those things with idle remarks about the weather or the cutting of the hay. But we find out that, one day, he came home and found the optometrist, Mr. Willens, examining his wife —  he was kneeling on the floor, with his hand on her leg, and accidentally her skirt had been pulled up slightly above her knee. Somehow, this enrages him. Emotion just overflows in him, and he commits murder just like that. A lifetime of restraint builds up to the point that he has an absolute lapse of control. Munro describes the aftermath of the murder this way: “Rupert jumped out of the chair so that it was still rocking, and he started picking up all the things and putting each one back where it went in Mr. Willens’ box. ” To me, that’s such a human response. It’s what most characterizes Rupert, this repression, this obsession with order. Here he’s got Mr. Willens’s dead body in his room, with   foam coming out of his mouth —  and yet, the first thing he does after that lapse of control is put all the   instruments back into this red box. Everything in him is entirely under the surface. And so, later, when Alice Munro puts a hatchet in that man’s hands and has another character tell him that she knows all his secrets, the danger is so much greater. If you only read the story once, it’s easy to miss that we’ve been introduced to this red box already. But it’s right there on the first page: “Also, there was a red box,” with this casual little “also” there, as if it’s an afterthought. Of course, it’s not at all an afterthought —  it’s the key to an unsolved murder, even though we could never know that at the beginning. We can only sense it the quiet intensity of Munro’s voice. The last thing we learn about this box is that Mrs. Quinn, Rupert’s wife and Enid’s patient, hid it somewhere —  Mrs. Quinn will never tell where. Yet, here, at the beginning of this story, we know exactly where it is. It’s in the museum, but how did it get there? The museum offers its own explanation: “It was found, presumably, by the anonymous donor. ” “Presumably”: an   distant, museum word. Yet it contains the whole aching mystery of these characters’ lives, a mystery that the story is too perfect to outright name. It’s so hard to exercise this level of restraint. In flashier stories, I often encounter images that feel to me, ultimately, to be dishonest. I’m thinking of a story I read recently by a renowned author, that begins with a   narrator describing the drowning of his daughter. She’s on a lake playing hockey, and the ice breaks and she drowns —  but the way that this narrator describes his daughter drowning is so beautiful. There’s something about her hair drifting upward as she goes under, the hockey stick left spinning on the ice like a compass. These are amazing similes and descriptors. But I was kind of appalled, because this is not how a father would remember the drowning of his daughter. He simply would not use language that way. There would be absolutely nothing beautiful about it. The story was   and it was published in a great magazine, but something that Alice Munro never does is privilege language over character, or anything over character. This is something I try to think about when I’m writing —  there are times, definitely, when I feel like I have to cut back on what I’ve just written because it’s not quite honest yet. In my novel, I wrote about an event that’s so shocking and ugly —  the murder of a little girl. I struggled the whole book with how to make clear what happened, the actual events of what took place, without the language being too direct as to be vulgar, or too vague as to be beautiful. It was a challenge to describe something so ugly and unfathomable in language that was both plainspoken and mysterious, while also remaining true to the voice of the novel, which is a poetic voice. I had to go back and exercise restraint sometimes, really struggle over certain paragraphs for a long time. The challenge is to word something clearly while also leaving enough room for mystery, to let things remain open and complex for the reader even if I’ve made up my mind. That’s always very hard. At the end of “The Love of a Good Woman,” Enid imagines that she’s going to tell Rupert that she knows he committed murder. In her vision of things, she’s going to lead him back to the police station and he’s going to confess, and they’re going to kind of have this weird romance while he’s in prison. I remember teaching this story, once, and trying to explain about open endings: Even though we don’t get to see Enid follow through, the fact that she has made the decision to do what she’s going to do is an ending in its own. But then one of my students raised her hand. “But Ms. Ruskovich,” she said. “We do know what happens. Or at least we know what doesn’t happen. ” And she read out loud the passage from the very beginning, about the red box: “This box of optometrist’s instruments though not very old has considerable local significance, since it belonged to Mr. D. M. Willens, who drowned in the Peregrine River in 1951. ” And she was right —  though, in all the times that I had read this story, I never saw it. I never saw that the answer to the ending was in this little aside, right here in the second paragraph. Because if Enid had turned Rupert in, the local museum certainly wouldn’t have had a sign saying that Mr. Willens drowned in the Peregrine River. We know, then, she did not do what she’d resolved to do. So how did the box get there? The only conceivable answer is that Enid  …     well, I don’t know, actually. I guess that’s why I love this. The closer you get to a character, the more mysterious he or she becomes. The closer you get to that red box, the more mysterious it becomes. When you start the story, the box is just an object sitting among other objects, covered in dust —  next to a horse harness and an old dentist’s chair and an apple peeler. But as you read and   you start to sense the human history that can be told through these objects. Each one is suffused with a whole lifetime of compassion and secrets and suffering. And though Munro gives us the privilege of looking at one of them, the red box, the other objects are left unspoken for. That’s very moving: you get the sense that you could write an entire novel about the horse harness, too, or the dentist’s chair, or the apple peeler. The story itself is as   as its characters in the way that it’s told, the way scenes are arranged, with no great attention at all paid to the most crucial of details —  even though those details are there, plainly, for everyone to see, infused with a mystery so profound that they can only be articulated plainly. Some of my students have even remarked that these opening passages are “boring. ” And yet this beginning —  this distant, restrained,   beginning —  is the key to everything. It’s so honest. So real. The greatest mysteries of humanity are hidden in plain sight here, hidden inside of such   language."
TV Shows to Look Forward to in 2017 (So Far),Atlantic,David Sims,2017-01-04,"More and more, superheroes are encroaching on the world of TV (though not as much as film). But there’s plenty else to look forward to on the small screen in 2017: debuts of promising original shows, new seasons of critical favorites like The Leftovers and Fargo, and the   return of Star Trek, one of television’s most famous franchises, to its original medium. Below, a list of the 20 most exciting shows in the coming year. Emerald City, Friday on NBCPremieres January 6, In the last 10 years, audiences have gotten Wicked, Oz the Great and Powerful, and a revamped The Wiz, but NBC in its infinite wisdom thinks the world needs a fresh take on The Wizard of Oz, so here’s a “dark and edgy” reboot. Directed by the visually adventurous Tarsem Singh (who made The Fall and the Snow White update Mirror, Mirror) Emerald City features Vincent D’Onofrio as the Wizard, steampunk helicopters, and a German Shepherd Toto. Your best guess as to the point of all this is as good as mine. One Day at a Time, Friday on NetflixPremieres January 6, Though Netflix has experimented with the TV format over the years, it’s beginning to embrace the     comedy as well, here revamping Norman Lear’s classic family sitcom for 2017 audiences. One Day at a Time is still a   sitcom about a single mother —  Penelope (Justina Machado) a   military veteran with a teenage daughter and “socially adept tween” son. Rita Moreno   as Penelope’s grandmother, and early reviews are strong. Taboo, Tuesday on FXPremieres January 10, This miniseries comes from   Steven Knight (who wrote Dirty Pretty Things, Locke, and Allied among others) Tom Hardy, and his father, credited as “Chips” Hardy. Unfortunately, Taboo is not about how Chips got his nickname —  it’s an   story about a mysterious man (played by Tom Hardy) who returns to London in 1814 after years in Africa, seeking revenge on the East India Company for his father’s death. A Series of Unfortunate Events, Friday on NetflixPremieres January 13, Fans largely derided the 2004 film adaptation of Lemony Snicket’s series of dark children’s novels. But an   Netflix series might prove a better medium for translating the   series, with author Daniel Handler (who penned the books under the Snicket pseudonym) scripting. Neil Patrick Harris stars as the villainous Count Olaf, with Joan Cusack, Patrick Warburton, and Alfre Woodard among the supporting cast. The Young Pope, Sunday on HBOPremieres January 15, Here’s the pitch: Lenny Belardo (Jude Law) is the new pope (the first American in history to hold the position) and boy, is he young. Created by the operatic Italian director Paolo Sorrentino (behind such films as The Great Beauty and Youth) The Young Pope isn’t going for subtlety, but it has already aired in Italy and the UK to critical acclaim. HBO is positioning the show as its big winter prestige drama, and if nothing else, it looks like opulent fun. Diane Keaton   as Lenny’s mentor and personal secretary. Riverdale, Thursday on The CWPremieres January 26, A millennial revamping of the Archie Comics universe, which features a surprisingly buff Archie Andrews (K. J. Apa) a “philosophically bent” Jughead (whatever that may mean) a mysterious past for Cheryl Blossom, and Luke Perry as Archie’s grizzled dad. Betty and Veronica are on board too, of course.  As silly as some of the details might sound, early word on the show is strong, perhaps because it was developed by the veteran   and TV writer Roberto  . Powerless, Thursday on NBCPremieres February 2, Unlike Marvel’s attempts at television   to its superhero movies, Powerless (which is connected to the DC comics universe) is a show about ordinary folks trying to live their lives around the chaos of Superman, Batman, and their ilk saving lives. Vanessa Hudgens and Danny Pudi star as office drones working in the bowels of Bruce Wayne’s company, with Alan Tudyk as their tyrannical boss. Essentially, it’s a workplace sitcom, just with superheroes whizzing around in the background. Santa Clarita Diet, Friday on NetflixPremieres February 3, Sprung from the truly underrated comic mind of Victor Fresco (Andy Richter Controls the Universe, Better Off Ted) Santa Clarita Diet might be his first series to not suffer an untimely cancellation despite critical acclaim, thanks to the less   honchos at Netflix. Drew Barrymore and Timothy Olyphant star as   agents getting divorced, whose lives then take an unspecified “dark turn. ” 24: Legacy, Sunday on FoxPremieres February 5, After eight seasons, a revival, and a TV movie, Kiefer Sutherland’s Jack Bauer is officially retired, but Fox is reviving the   action of 24 yet again, focusing on a new agent at the fictional   Unit. Eric Carter (Corey Hawkins) an   Ranger, is sure to get sucked into many a deadly conspiracy, with Miranda Otto and Jimmy Smits among the ensemble he has to protect. Will the show work without Kiefer screaming into his cellphone? Legion, Wednesday on FXPremieres February 8, Viewers are getting another superhero   show, but this one’s adjacent to the   universe and based on the character Legion, a schizophrenic who realizes there may be more to his diagnosis. Legion is a tricky character to get right, but the show is from the talented Noah Hawley (Fargo) and has a terrific cast, including Dan Stevens (Downton Abbey) Aubrey Plaza (Parks and Recreation) and Fargo alumnus Jean Smart. Girls, Sunday on HBOReturns February 12, Much ink has been spilled about Girls since its debut in 2012, but this is everyone’s last shot to weigh in on Hannah Horvath (Lena Dunham) and company’s antics —  season six will be the last. These final 10 episodes will surely air free of controversy and nary a hot take will be written about them, especially ones about what the show has meant for millennial culture. Crashing, Sunday on HBOPremieres February 19, One potential successor for Girls is another HBO   shepherded to screen by comedy vet Judd Apatow. Pete Holmes, a brilliant   who has long been in search of the right TV project (his TBS   talk show was canceled too soon) created Crashing and based it on his own life in the   world. It follows Pete (Holmes, playing himself) who’s trying to cobble together a living as a comedian while dealing with the collapse of his marriage. The Good Fight, Sunday on CBS All AccessPremieres February 19, A spinoff of   legal drama The Good Wife, this show is being used to launch CBS’s new streaming service CBS All Access, premiering on the TV network before bouncing over to the online   network. Set a year after The Good Wife’s finale, The Good Fight follows Diane Lockhart (Christine Baranski) as she moves to a new Chicago law firm with her former colleague Lucca Quinn (Cush Jumbo) and her goddaughter Maia (Rose Leslie of Game of Thrones). Delroy Lindo   as a rival attorney. Iron Fist, Friday on NetflixPremieres March 17, The Netflix Marvel universe continues to build out with its most problematic superhero —  Danny Rand (played by Finn Jones of Game of Thrones) a billionaire industrialist who has been missing for 15 years and returns to New York proficient in kung fu. Though Rand (created in the ’70s during the first   boom for   movies in the U. S.) has always been written as white, he may be an uncomfortable sight for Marvel in 2017, especially after the whitewashing controversy over its film Doctor Strange. The Handmaid’s Tale, Wednesday on HuluPremieres April 26, Margaret Atwood’s 1985 masterpiece of speculative fiction, set in a totalitarian theocracy where women’s rights have been erased by a religious movement that seized power in the United States, seems quite relevant to the contemporary political mood, and has never gotten a proper adaptation. Hulu is positioning this   series as its prestige drama of the spring, with Elisabeth Moss starring as Offred Joseph Fiennes, Samira Wiley, and Yvonne Strahovski  . FargoReturns this spring on FX, No official premiere date has been set for the third season of Fargo, but the cast is as stacked as ever, with Ewan McGregor playing dual lead roles, and Carrie Coon (The Leftovers) David Thewlis, Michael Stuhlbarg, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead all involved. Unlike the last season, the show will be set in the   day (2010, according to reports) opening up the possibility that characters from its first season could return (though the creator Noah Hawley is keeping quiet about any plot details). The Leftovers, Returns this April on HBO, In its second season, this TV adaptation of Tom Perrotta’s novel The Leftovers built on its promise to become one of the best, most fascinating, confounding shows on television. Perhaps cognizant that his last great show (Lost) lasted a little too long,   Damon Lindelof is ending the show this year, shifting the action to Australia but keeping the entire main cast (minus Ann Dowd’s dearly departed Patti Levin). The show will struggle to top season 2’s episode “International Assassin,” but whatever Lindelof and Perrotta do come up with is sure to be fascinating. American Gods, Premieres this April on Starz, A   adaptation of Neil Gaiman’s 2001 novel, focusing on Shadow Moon (Ricky Whittle) an   recruited by the mysterious Mr. Wednesday (Ian McShane) who is recruiting the world’s forgotten gods (to say more would be spoiling). Adapted by Bryan Fuller (Hannibal) and Michael Green (Kings) the series, which was initially in production at HBO, promises to be a suitably epic take on Gaiman’s writing. (The first season will cover only the first third of his novel). Star Trek: Discovery, Premieres this May on CBS All Access, The first Star Trek show since Enterprise concluded in 2005, Discovery has a heavy fan burden to shoulder, but an exciting cast and crew aboard. Set 10 years before the original Star Trek series, Discovery will not take place in the world of the recent rebooted film series, instead charting the journey of the USS Discovery after weathering a much discussed but secret “incident” in Trek lore. Sonequa   (The Walking Dead) stars as Rainsford, the ship’s second officer (the first   officer to headline a Trek series). Like The Good Fight, this show will premiere on CBS then move to its All Access streaming network. Game of Thrones, Returns this summer on HBO, Knocked from its usual April perch by a filming schedule that demanded more time in snowier climes (winter has, after all, come to Westeros) the seventh and penultimate season of Game of Thrones will arrive at some point this summer on HBO for an abridged seven episodes. Will George R. R. Martin finish his next book before then? Will Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen become the best of friends? Will Cersei Lannister’s quest for power finally end in glory? All that, and much more, as HBO tries to squeeze as much life out of its big ticket as possible before the whole shebang wraps in 2018."
The Ideological Reasons Why Democrats Have Neglected Local Politics,Atlantic,Emma Green,2017-01-04,"After making it to the top, Barack Obama is looking down. In October, the outgoing president signaled that he will focus on   politics when he leaves office. This promise took on new urgency after the election, which left Republicans in control of 32 statehouses and 33 governor’s mansions, not to mention both chambers of Congress and the White House. “One of the big suggestions that I have for Democrats as I leave   …     is how do we do more of that   building?” the president told NPR in December. “What I’m interested in is just developing a whole new generation of talent. ” Obama seems to be taking part in the larger process of soul searching among Democrats. “I wonder, sometimes, whether the Democratic Party has contributed to [a decline in local politics] by making the president and the federal government the fulcrum of so much, and suggesting that we can solve these problems from the top down,” said David Axelrod, the former senior Obama administration advisor, during a recent panel discussion at the University of Chicago. “Democrats have ceded a lot of statehouses and legislatures. Congress has been gridlocked. And the notion has been: What can the president do with the power that he has to try and create some progressive action? It just puts a lot of weight on the presidency, when maybe we have to be a bit more innovative. ” The Atlantic  Politics  Policy Daily: Congress Clocks In, These explanations are not primarily philosophical. They’re about winning. In the face of painful electoral losses, Democrats are rediscovering the strategic case for activism at the state and local level. Yet there are deep historical and ideological reasons why the party has tended to focus on the federal government as a means of making policy. An ideological shift would be much more important, and is more unlikely, than a strategic one. As Democrats move to focus on state and local politics in 2017, this distinction between ideology and strategy will be important to watch. The party, and progressives more broadly, could take up a friendly posture toward state and local governance on the grounds that Americans should directly influence the laws that constrain them and the policies that supposedly benefit them. Alternatively, this sudden impulse toward state and local organizing could prove instrumental and temporary, doomed to reversal whenever the party wins back the U. S. Senate or the White House. Democrats’ approach to federalism will matter for the future of the party and the permanence of its policies. But ultimately, it will show what Democratic leaders really believe about people’s proper role in their government. For some progressives, a renewed focus on state and local politics is primarily about obstructing Washington Republicans. Heather Gerken, a Yale law professor, wrote a piece for Vox about why the left should embrace federalism in the coming years —  essentially, she argued, it offers ways to counteract federal policies. “Progressives at the state and local level can influence policy simply by refusing to partner with the federal government,” she wrote. “If blue states and cities refuse to implement Trump’s agenda, Republicans will sometimes be forced to compromise rather than pay a political and fiscal price. ” For others, local politics are more important in their own right. “We think there’s a lot of importance in protecting local democracy,” said Nikki Fortunato Bas, the executive director of the Partnership for Working Families, a network of regional advocacy organizations that work on economic and environmental issues. “It’s in the communities [where] we live [that] we’re most connected to the need of our neighbors, and lawmakers are most connected to the needs of their constituents. ” Regardless of their reasons for wanting to focus on state and local politics, Democrats will be limited by the enormous imbalances of party power in governors’ mansions, state legislatures, and city halls. Especially during Obama’s second term in office, the party lost control and influence in a number of statehouses. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, the party controls roughly half as many state legislatures as it did in 2010, and roughly half as many states will enter 2017 with a partisan split compared to the same year. Similarly, Democrats have been losing governships steadily since Obama took office in 2008: Compared to the 29 states held by Democrats that year, the party now holds 16. The only place where Democrats still dominate across the country is in large cities, where they control many city halls. The unevenness is partly a reflection of progressives’ reluctance to push their policy agendas through states. Historically, arguments against federalism —  or the principle that power should be robustly shared between state and national governments —  have centered on race. “Progressives are deeply skeptical of federalism, and with good reason,” Gerken wrote in a 2012 essay in Democracy. “States’ rights have been invoked to defend some of the most despicable institutions in American history, most notably slavery and Jim Crow. ” Others see the decentralization of governing power as a way of stifling dissent, she argued. This is one reason why the national Democratic Party has often looked to Washington to make and enforce policy. But there’s another ideological explanation, argued Ernest Young, a professor of law at Duke University, in an interview: The progressive project is ultimately about working toward a society built on one unified vision of policy and culture, rather than a diverse array of policies and cultures. “If you’re confident that you can get the right answer to something, like   policy, or welfare, or any number of very difficult social problems, it’s hard not to say that right answer should be equally available to everyone,” Young said, meaning that progressives believe their “right answers” should be legislated through federal policy. “If you’re a more Burkean type of conservative, and you’re skeptical that we’re ever going to find out right answers to these questions, you might favor different solutions in different jurisdictions, and see from experience what works out. That tends to lend itself to a commitment to federalism, and local governments, too,” he said. Not all progressives believe that most policymaking should happen at the federal level. Especially in recent years, some policymakers have looked to cities and municipalities to lead reform efforts. “Cities were the original sites of disruption: They disrupt class orders they disrupt social practices they disrupt businesses,” said Jennifer Bradley, the director of the Center for Urban Innovation at the Aspen Institute. No matter what Obama and other national Democrats may say, this work has already been in progress, she added. “This notion that Democrats were relying too heavily on the federal government is belied by eight years of what actually happened,” she said. In part because Washington is so dysfunctional, “cities and states have learned to rely less and less on the federal government, and I think that trend will sharply accelerate. ” Practically speaking, the narrative that progressives favor federal policymaking while conservatives favor state and local action is far too simplistic. Both parties tend to use federal power when they have it. “George W. Bush, as a matter of ideology, cared a lot about states,” Young pointed out. “But the first thing he did as president was to shift power to the federal government in the area of education, which had been a terribly important area of state predominance. ” Conversely, both parties have used   litigation to intervene in federal policymaking when they’ve been out of power. Take Massachusetts vs. Environmental Protection Agency, the   Supreme Court case in which 12 states, several cities, and advocacy groups sued to force the EPA to begin regulating greenhouse gases. During the Obama years, other states pulled a similar move —  Texas sued the administration over deferred immigration enforcement for people in the country illegally, for example. “Broadly, I think federalism is not a conservative or liberal thing, or a Republican or Democrat thing,” Young said. “It offers a way of not having all your eggs in one basket when changes in who controls various institutions occur. ” It’s also a way of making sure one party doesn’t force the other permanently out of power at the national level: As Democrats are now discovering, it’s hard to get elected in districts that   state legislatures have gerrymandered to favor their own party. But there’s a reason why the United States is not a constellation of    . Federalism is a political orientation, not a body of   policy prescriptions. The negotiation of power between national and state governments —  and, relatedly, between state and local governments —  is complicated and partisan. Larger bodies of government, led by Democrats and Republicans alike, often threaten smaller bodies with litigation or funding cuts if they don’t follow certain policies. During the Reagan years, the federal government famously used this method to get states to comply with its policy on the legal drinking age. And in 2016, the Obama administration used a similar method when it sent a letter to school districts instructing them to comply with federal guidance on accommodations for transgender students. States often write laws limiting cities from legislating certain issues as well. North Carolina’s H. B. 2 may have been the most notorious of these kinds of prohibitions in 2016: Among other things, the statute prohibited cities from passing   ordinances to protect LGBT residents. Preemption on LGBT issues is fairly new, according to the Partnership for Working Families. States preempt cities and municipalities most frequently on issues like transportation regulations,   standards, labor agreements, and policies on earned sick days, the organization reports. If national Democrats are truly interested in revitalizing state and local governance, perhaps they’ll push to repeal these kinds of preemption laws, which force policy decisions into the realm of larger and larger legislative bodies. Or maybe they’ll swear off executive orders, on which the Obama administration heavily relied, whenever they eventually regain federal power. It’s not like voters are big fans of the federal government, anyways: According to Pew Research Center, Americans’ trust in bodies like Congress has been declining for at least the last decade, while their belief in state and local bodies is much higher and has remained relatively constant over the years. This might be the most compelling of all arguments for a new era of federalism: Voters simply don’t like or trust the federal government. As a new administration prepares to take office, “The one thing I really hope states and locals can do is model a different kind of political behavior,” Bradley said. “What I would hope is that the actions of state and local lawmakers can restore people’s faith and trust, honestly, in democracy. ”"
Republicans Grapple With the Risk of Overreach,Atlantic,Russell Berman,2017-01-03,"“Let us not be timid,” Paul Ryan exhorted members of the House on Tuesday, moments after 239 Republicans had, in   fashion,   him as speaker. He was girding his party for what he called “the opportunity of a lifetime” —  the chance to remake Washington under   Donald Trump and unified Republican control of government. Ryan needn’t have worried about his members’ gumption: They had committed their first act of political overreach before the 115th Congress was even sworn in. The night before, a majority of House Republicans had voted behind closed doors to gut the Office of Congressional Ethics, a   independent body that had arisen out of the last era of GOP scandal. They had acted against the better judgment of their leaders, including Ryan, who had accurately warned them that such a move would undermine the party’s effort to open the new Congress in a mood of unity and optimism. A predictable uproar ensued, and with a modest push from Trump, Republican lawmakers hastily reconvened to rescind their amendment barely five minutes before the 115th Congress gaveled into session. The GOP’s Ethics Disaster, The episode was, in a sense, a test of political boundaries for a party that sees itself as having won a broad mandate from the voters. If Trump could get away with all manner of offensive comments, damaging revelations, ethical malfeasance and still get elected president, what would stop lawmakers from neutering a pesky ethics office that had ensnared many of them (and Democrats, too!) in investigations? As it turned out, Trump’s victory did not mean the end of public scrutiny it did not immunize politicians from nasty headlines or angry phone calls, emails, and tweets. Republicans backed away from their ethics gambit, but as Ryan made clear, they are intent on acting swiftly on an ambitious policy agenda to dismantle key parts of the Obama presidency and replace them with   conservative reforms. “We have a lot to do —  and a lot to undo,” House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy wrote in a message to lawmakers over the weekend. GOP leaders plan to devote the next two weeks to teeing up legislation that Trump can sign in his  first weeks in office. The House will vote this week on bills to prevent Obama from issuing a slew of new regulations on his way out of office and to ensure Congress has a say in major new regulations going forward. The first day in the Senate brought the introduction of a budget resolution that will lay the groundwork for repealing core pieces of the Affordable Care Act. The two chambers hope to send the actual repeal bill —  sans an Obamacare replacement —  to Trump’s desk in the next month or so. “The people have given us unified government,” Ryan said in his    opening address. “And it wasn’t because they were feeling generous. It’s because they wanted results. How could we live with ourselves if we let them down? How could we let ourselves down?” If Republicans are feeling pressure to deliver results for their voters, so too are Democrats under pressure to deliver a fight for theirs. The beginning of a new Congress usually brings a brief respite from the usual partisanship. Young children clog the Capitol halls as lawmakers bring their families to their   the two chambers gavel in with rituals of pomp and circumstance, and   members learn the way to their offices (and to the bathrooms). But on this opening day, Democrats in both the House and the Senate were digging in for battle. In a   of Republican rules designed to punish actual member protests, Democratic House members embellished their speaker votes for Nancy Pelosi by adding the preamble, “Because the people’s House should be ethical, accountable, and open to free debate. .. ” During her ceremonial introduction of Ryan upon his election as speaker, Pelosi digressed to warn Republicans that if they tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act, cut Medicare, or otherwise roll back Obama’s legacy, “Democrats will stand our ground. ” And in the Senate, the new Democratic leader, Charles Schumer of New York, used his own opening remarks to warn both Trump and the Republican majorities that Democrats would hold them accountable across the full range of promises that they made during the campaign. “We will hold Trump accountable to the values that truly make America great,” Schumer said. “But we’ll fight him tooth and nail when he appeals to the baser instincts that diminish America and its greatness —  instincts that have too often plagued this country and his campaign. ” Democrats are banking on Republicans falling short —  that the party unity on display in Ryan’s election on Tuesday will quickly fade, that the slim GOP majority in the Senate will stumble and bicker, that an inexperienced and impatient president will grow frustrated with his party’s struggle in Congress. And most of all, Democrats are waiting for Republicans to overreach, to interpret a narrow presidential victory as an endorsement of conservative dogma and push forward with   changes to entitlements, the tax code, and consumer protections. That, they believe, would invite a public backlash —  much like the one that greeted Republicans on Tuesday after their   ethics maneuver. Republicans may have learned that the law of political gravity still applies to them. But their chastening on ethics isn’t likely to humble them on policy. GOP leaders have been waiting for this moment for a decade, and don’t expect them to be timid. "
Why Christians Are Disproportionately Powerful in Congress,Atlantic,Emma Green,2017-01-03,"The 115th Congress is back in session, and at least one thing looks the same as usual: 91 percent of its members identify as Christians. This proportion has basically remained constant for more than five decades, as long as this kind of data has been available, according to a new study from Pew Research Center. What has changed is the U. S. population: Only 71 percent of American adults identify as Christians. Some religious minorities, including Muslims, Hindus, and Buddhists, are slightly underrepresented in Congress relative to their population sizes in the United States, while others, including Jews and Mormons, are slightly overrepresented. But these groups aren’t the source of the demographic mismatch between Congress and the rest of the country. The Americans who are vastly underrepresented in Congress are those who don’t identify with any religion at all: Only one member of Congress, Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, says she is religiously unaffiliated, while 10 others declined to state their affiliation in surveys and interviews with CQ Roll Call. The Futility of Representing Religion With a Bar Chart, There are at least two good explanations for this phenomenon. The first is that religiously unaffiliated Americans don’t vote. Another way of putting that is that young people don’t vote: According to the Public Religion Research Institute,      are three times as likely to be religiously unaffiliated compared to people over 65. Even though the religiously unaffiliated share of the American population has significantly increased from 14 to 22 percent between 2004 and 2014, the share of religiously unaffiliated voters only increased from 9 to 12 percent. This chart offers a stark illustration of how politically disengaged these voters really are: Religiously Unaffiliated Americans Don’t Vote  Scholars and journalists have long decried the civic apathy of the young. But at least in terms of religious demographics, it makes sense that there has not been a political revolution under the banner of irreligion: “Religiously unaffiliated” is a category popularized by pollsters. It is a useful demographic tool, but not a very useful way of understanding how these Americans think about politics. “Religiously unaffiliated” means these Americans don’t feel like they’re part of any particular religious tradition or denomination. But that includes a huge and diverse group of people. Those who formally identify as atheists and agnostics are actually a minority, representing roughly 3 and 4 percent of the American population, respectively. Others in this group, which includes roughly 23 percent of Americans, might be in the process of changing religions or feel like they have no spiritual home in a formal house of worship. They include people who believe in God and people who might be married to a spouse with a different faith background. And they include lots of people who don’t find religion particularly important or relevant in their lives. This, above all, is why it’s suspect to suggest that religiously unaffiliated people are underrepresented in Congress: They are not actually a coherent demographic group. It makes some sense that people who have mixed feelings or don’t care about religion wouldn’t bother organizing to get more of their kind in Congress. It’s also possible that at least some of the members who claimed a specific faith on their CQ Roll Call survey are only nominally religious, anyways. After all, any pollster worth his galleons knows it’s tough to elect atheists to political office.   If this is truly a crisis of representation, there’s good news. Religiously unaffiliated Americans who are bothered by their lack of a voice in Congress can use one simple trick to start making change: They can vote."

Can Trump Enforce His Red Line on North Korea?,Atlantic,James Acton,2017-01-06,"It was only eight years ago that the United States had just one president at a time. Yet those days have felt much more distant over the past two months as the   Donald Trump, has set about merrily reshaping U. S. policy 140 characters at a time. Tuesday evening saw what might turn out to be one of his more consequential Twitter proclamations. In a New Year’s address, North Korea’s supreme leader, Kim Jong Un, had stated that his country had “entered the final stage of preparation for the test launch of intercontinental ballistic missile. ” In response, Trump tweeted that “North Korea just stated that it is in the final stages of developing a nuclear weapon capable of reaching parts of the U. S. It won’t happen!” How to Stop a Nuclear Missile, If Trump’s tweet is to be taken literally —  and perhaps, as the saying goes, it should be taken seriously but not literally —  he appears to have committed to preventing Kim from acquiring the capability to threaten the United States with a   missile, as opposed to necessarily stopping the test that Kim says he is planning. Yet, regardless of Trump’s actual intentions, the tweet could come to be seen as a “red line” and hence set up a potential test of his credibility. Much will depend, of course, on whether Trump subsequently doubles down on his pledge, but now that the tweet is out there, he has only limited influence on how it is viewed by North Korea, U. S. allies, and the American people. Past U. S. presidents have discovered that red lines against North Korea are easy to set but difficult to enforce. On June 29, 2006, when North Korea was preparing to test another   missile, President George W. Bush declared that launching it would be “unacceptable. ” Not only did Pyongyang go ahead with the launch anyway, but it did so on July 4. North Korea crossed other U. S. red lines too that year. In October, Pyongyang conducted its first nuclear test in spite of a warning by Bush, a year earlier, that “a   North Korea will not be tolerated. ” The United States has been putting up with the Kim dynasty’s possession of nuclear weapons ever since. Over the last year, North Korea’s   efforts have made significant progress due to an unprecedented level of testing. Unless those efforts are somehow checked, there can be little doubt that, even without foreign assistance, they will result in a   intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) —  though there is some uncertainty about timing. It is difficult to conceive how Trump could enforce his red line —  if that is what he decides to do —  without ultimately reaching a negotiated settlement or authorizing   military action. The other policy tools he might try to wield —  economic sanctions, pressure from China, military threats, and even limited strikes (such as blowing up a missile on the launch pad) —  are not ends in themselves. They might be able to provide the United States with leverage at the negotiating table. If they don’t, they could provide justification for a major attack. By themselves, however, they cannot deny North Korea a   ICBM indefinitely.   military action would be fraught with risks, of which two stand out. First, strikes against North Korean   missiles and their production infrastructure —  the absolute minimum target set required to enforce Trump’s red line —  would risk terrible retaliation. Seoul, for example, is within reach of a prodigious quantity of North Korean artillery. U. S. bases in Japan could be hit by   North Korean missiles, some of which may already be  . Broadening the target set to include more North Korean military assets would merely increase Pyongyang’s incentives to employ whatever survived in even less discriminate ways. Second, after a strike, North Korea could —  and almost certainly would —  attempt to rebuild its missile force. As a result, the United States would either need to occupy the country or else launch periodic strikes to “mow the grass. ” Diplomacy, then, is the better option, though “better” is a relative term. In theory, Trump’s goal could be met if North Korea agreed to suspend nuclear and   missile tests in return for some    concessions from the United States. This approach would stop North Korea from developing a   ICBM through trial and error. And, while it would not stop theoretical and   research, it would severely curtail the reliability of any resulting weapon. In practice, the challenges to even reaching —  let alone enforcing —  a deal are manifold. For starters, it is far from clear that North Korea actually wants a deal, at least at any price that the United States and its allies might be willing to pay. Diplomacy would probably be more difficult if North Korea asked —  as it might well do —  for an end to joint U. S.  Korean military exercises or a peace treaty to replace the armistice that stopped the Korean War but didn’t formally end it, as opposed to economic aid. In return for such   concessions, South Korea might want much more on disarmament from North Korea than just a testing moratorium —  though how much Trump would take Seoul’s concern into account is an open question. Moreover, even if a reasonable quid pro quo can be reached, there is the surprisingly thorny question of how to define a   missile. On February 29, 2012, Pyongyang agreed to a moratorium on nuclear and   missile tests (among various other measures) in return for food aid from the United States. Only 16 days later, North Korea announced plans for a satellite launch, which the United States argued was an ICBM test in disguise. The deal fell apart shortly thereafter. Then there is the challenge of negotiating the timetable for the deal’s implementation. To maintain as much leverage over North Korea as possible, the United States is likely to want to provide whatever concessions it agrees to make only after a prolonged period of compliance by Pyongyang. North Korea is likely to argue that it can’t trust Washington to cough up later and that it should be rewarded early. Yet in spite of these and other challenges, there is really very little reason for the great dealmaker not to try his hand at diplomacy with Pyongyang. In the very best case, he could prevent the emergence of a grave new threat to the United States indefinitely. More plausibly, he could delay it by a few, potentially valuable years. Even in the    worst case —  that no deal is reach or it falls apart almost immediately —  it is hard to see what the United States would lose from trying. Besides, if it all goes wrong and North Korea successfully demonstrates a   ICBM, Trump could always just deny he said it wouldn’t happen."
Bright Lights Captures the Magic of Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds,Atlantic,Sophie Gilbert,2017-01-06,"   Toward the end of Bright Lights: Starring Debbie Reynolds and Carrie Fisher, Reynolds rests on a couch, frail but sparkling after receiving a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Screen Actors Guild. “There’s no business like show business,” she says. Fisher, resting her head on her mother’s shoulder, senses an opportunity. “You know what, I have to say something,” she says, perfectly deadpan. “Everything about it is appealing. ” Reynolds frowns intently, and joins in. “Nowhere can you get that special feeling. ” The pair work through the impromptu skit, perfectly serious, and perfectly in sync. There are moments like this peppered throughout Bright Lights, a documentary by Alexis Bloom and Fisher Stevens airing Saturday on HBO that captures the forceful personalities and extraordinary charisma of both women, and their fierce but complex love for one another. The film debuted at the Cannes Film Festival last year, and was originally scheduled to air in March, but was moved up after Fisher and Reynolds died at the end of 2016, just a day apart. Given the context, it functions as an adoring tribute to the two performers, but it’s also a snapshot of the kind of relationship documentarians dream about: two eccentric, outgoing personalities, living in almost   proximity, recalling their glory days.   Grey Gardens,   Jane without the malice, Bright Lights is endlessly charming and sometimes deeply moving. Considering Creativity and Addiction in The Life and Times of DJ AM  It helps that Reynolds and Fisher are such perfect representatives of their respective Hollywood generations, the first a disciplined, controlled product of the studio system, and the second a messier, unfiltered, unflinchingly honest star, whose candor about her   and addiction issues made her achievements more tangible. Bright Lights gets most of its scenes from Fisher, following her to London, to a Star Wars convention, and around her house, with its quirky decor and errant artifacts (a Princess Leia sex doll, a suitcase named Robert). Reynold’s moments are more discreet, more choreographed. But her wit is   and her harmony with Fisher completely in tune. “I share everything with my daughter, especially the check,” she remarks in one scene. The film’s structure is loose, almost nonexistent, and its main arc seems to be Fisher’s concern for her mother’s health, which comes across now as sharply poignant. Reynolds continues to book performances, which wear her out, so Fisher accompanies her to a cavernous hall in Connecticut and to a shopworn casino in Vegas, where Reynolds zips across the floor on a motor scooter, almost unrecognizable. “You’ve heard of a tsunami, see, she’s ” Fisher quips early in the movie. The pair live in separate houses within the same Beverly Hills estate, but they’re a constant presence in each other’s lives. “I usually come to her,” Fisher explains, walking across the lawn clutching a cheese soufflé she’s baked for her mother. “I always come to her. ” (“That is a beautiful puff,” Reynolds exclaims when she tastes the wares.) Bloom and Stevens feature a treasure trove of snapshots,   footage, film scenes, and previously documented family moments, thanks largely to Reynold’s passion for amassing Hollywood memorabilia. (One of the documentary’s subplots features her longtime attempts to found a museum along with her son, Todd, a supporting player in Bright Lights who tends to shrink next to the wattage of his mother and sister.) There are scenes of baby Carrie, perfectly groomed for stardom even as an infant, and even    Carrie, compelled by her mother to guest in her cabaret act, singing “Bridge Over Troubled Water” with the power and sass of a teenage Janis Joplin. “My mother wanted to be able to groom me for show business,” Fisher says. “The biggest thing I did that broke [her] heart was not do a nightclub act. ” Fisher allows the filmmakers virtually everywhere. In one scene, she works out with a trainer sent over by Lucasfilm, who tries to throw out her   cans and cigarettes, to no avail. In another, she chats with her friend Griffin Dunne while the pair sits on her bed, recalling how he generously helped her out with the loss of her virginity. The cameras are rolling, too, when she has a manic episode sparked by her distress at Debbie’s frailty in the   to the SAG Awards. She huddles on the floor in tears, then later launches into impassioned Hamlet quotes and songs while she’s having her nails done. Her concern for her mother is matched by Reynolds, who frequently tears up when talking to the camera about Fisher’s many battles. But the overarching sense of the film is that the pair have found an easy peace together, and that Reynolds is battling through each day mostly to be able to spend this time with her daughter. While Fisher insists Reynolds continues to perform because it “feeds her in a way that family cannot,” the impression in watching the pair interact is that their closeness means something more. In some moments, the two almost morph into each other by way of shared duets and  . If Bright Lights is, at times, a sharp reminder of what’s been lost, it’s also convincing evidence that wherever Fisher and Reynolds are now, they’re almost certainly together."
The Hacking Investigation Trump Wants Instead,Atlantic,Kaveh Waddell,2017-01-06,"  Donald Trump wants to get to the bottom of news reports that revealed that intelligence agencies had intercepted chatter among Russian government officials celebrating Trump’s election. But although he was scheduled to get briefed on the matter on Friday, he doesn’t seem very interested in the intelligence itself. Instead, he wants to find out how details from an unreleased intelligence report  —  the results of an investigation President Obama ordered last month —   made their way to the press. He tweeted Friday: I am asking the chairs of the House and Senate committees to investigate top secret intelligence shared with NBC prior to me seeing it. The   wasn’t specific about the committees he was referring to, and questions to his transition team went unanswered. But it’s likely Trump was talking about the House and Senate intelligence committees, whose leaders are privy to state secrets and were briefed on the classified report on Thursday. The committees could ostensibly hold hearings or perform an investigation into the leaks. But when Trump tweeted that he would reach out to the committees, he hadn’t yet communicated anything to their top members. A spokesperson for Devin Nunes, the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and a member of Trump’s own transition team, said that Nunes had “not received an official request on this yet. ” Neither had Adam Schiff, the Democratic ranking member of the same committee and an outspoken Trump critic, according to a representative. There was also no outreach to Mark Warner, the Democratic   of the Senate Intelligence Committee, a spokesperson said. The office of Richard Burr, the Republican chair of that committee, did not respond to a request for comment by press time. Schiff replied to Trump’s tweet shortly after it was sent, criticizing him for pursuing misplaced priorities by focusing on the leak: Of all issues implicated by Russian active measures, this is what you want to investigate? This is your top priority for intel committees? https:  .  And although Trump called for an investigation into the leaks “prior to [him] seeing” the intelligence community’s report, the Associated Press reported that the Director of National Intelligence and the heads of the FBI and the CIA arrived at Trump Tower at 1 p. m. Friday to deliver the classified briefing. Trump has repeatedly cast doubt on Russia’s role in hacking Democratic operatives and organizations. He’s questioned the intelligence community’s abilities and motivations, calling the focus on   hacking a “political witch hunt” in an interview with The New York Times on Friday, just hours before he was set to receive the   briefing. Now, as he’s being clued into the spy agencies’ classified findings, he’s looking to deflect attention from the report itself onto its leak to the press."
Run the Jewels’ Gloriously Obscene Rebellion,Atlantic,Spencer Kornhaber,2017-01-06,"   “Welcome to fuckyoupalooze,”   offers on Run the Jewels 3, and it might as well be the album’s alternate title. Since the initial 2013   of the rappers Killer Mike and   Run the Jewels have built a rep as fierce protest musicians, but their work is best understood as an omnidirectional middle finger. Over the course of their latest release, they threaten nuns, bunny rabbits, “moms from jazzercise,” and general politeness: “I don’t know how to not spit like a lout,”   says, adding, “I’ll spill a pound of my kids on your couch. ” It would seem like a good moment for loutish spitting, given the tenor of online discourse and given the    headed to the Oval Office. Not long ago, Run the Jewels came across as total outsiders, with the smart sorrowful conscience of Atlanta’s Killer Mike and the   agitation of Brooklyn’s   combining for a vibe out of step with the rap mainstream and much of American popular culture. But lately their finely detailed,    bombast seems strangely  : In style if not in substance, they indulge the rush of giddy, combative pessimism on the rise for both sides of the ideological spectrum. A Tribe Called Quest and the Shadow of Trump, To be clear, they stand firmly on the left side of that spectrum.   stopped wearing red hats because of Donald Trump Killer Mike worked as a Bernie Sanders surrogate. But Mike also opposed Hillary Clinton throughout the general election, saying she was “the same” as her opponent and alternately issuing “stay the fuck home” and “vote locally” messages to black people in the campaign’s final days. He’s possibly the leading cultural champion of the    mindset that took such a hold on portions of the traditional Democratic base that it may have swung the election, and he’s not softening now. “Choose the lesser of the evil people, and the devil still gon’ win,” he raps. “It could all be over tomorrow, kill our masters and start again. ” The fantasy of erasing the powerful and starting society again, of justice achieved through total rupture, has always been essential to the thrill of Run the Jewels’ music. It’s in the mechanized warfare of  ’s production, where   textures click and clack over propulsion recalling The Prodigy’s angry breakbeats. It’s in the  .  verbal teamwork creating rhyme patterns and   that are complementary,   and out of step with what you’re hearing elsewhere. And it’s in the   lyrics that swirl raunch and introspection and agitprop. Run the Jewels 3 is the longest of their releases —  14 songs, 51 minutes —  and it must be said their shtick at this scale does become a bit repetitive. Still, the highlights are enormous. “Down” makes a poignant start, putting the entire Run the Jewels project into perspective by establishing how a desperate past can color someone’s successful present. Over downbeat washes of sound, Mike talks about his fear of having to return to drug dealing and summarizes the Bill of Rights as it most urgently pertains to those like him: “One time for the freedom of speeches   Two time for the right to hold heaters   Just skip to the fifth, with the cops in the house, close your mouth and pray to your Jesus. ” From there, the duo vaults through a series of brag jams that double as   sessions, the musical geography defined less by verses and choruses than by clusters of epic moments. One comes when a deadpan female voice interrupts  ’s claim about what’s between his legs: “I got a unicorn horn for a —  ‘stop. ’” Another comes as the beat switches between the songs “Legend Has It” and “Call Ticketron,” the latter a   rave spiked with snippets of old commercials for Madison Square Garden seats. While the swagger often betrays a political sensibility —  Mike: “Domain eminent, we the preeminent” —  eventually they shift back into more serious, solemn modes. It’s especially solemn, and memorable, when the two give their own individual spins on grief for “Thursday in the Danger Room. ” As is typical,   focuses more on self and Mike more on community, but both deliver potent testimony. Earlier, the spacey “2100” contemplates pending civilizational catastrophes, with the title hinting either at the date of total disaster or of   repair —  though in Run the Jewels’ worldview, of course, these can be the same thing. The talk of inevitable holocaust and war hits hard after, say, recent famous tweets about nukes, but the song was written before the election and the sentiment has been the same all along for the band. “I’ve felt this dread pretty much my entire life,”   told Vulture. “I think we live in a bit of a bubble here. And that bubble’s popping. Everybody’s like, ‘Holy shit, things might not be fine if we turn the TV off. ’” Throughout, the rappers display South   disregard for decorum, most especially on the religious defilement anthem “Panther Like a Panther. ” This obscenity isn’t simple hijinks to hear them tell it, it’s a side effect of political bravery.  “I’m a pervert with purpose that make you question your purpose,” Killer Mike raps.  ’s take: “You talk clean and bomb hospitals   So I speak with the foulest mouth possible. ” Is this stuff actually going to shock people out of complacency? Maybe a few. But Run the Jewels raps first for its   fanbase, and the people who shell out for remix albums made entirely of cat meows are presumably already converted. The spectacle of       rhetoric works best to cinch performer and listener, a dynamic that’s   these days —  even outside of music."
Why Employers Are Rolling Back Raises,Atlantic,Adam Chandler,2017-01-06,"Just a few weeks ago, over four million Americans were poised to benefit from new overtime regulations at the start of the new year. The new rule —  which would require     pay for those working more than 40 hours a week —  was part of an executive order signed by President Obama in 2016. The order would have effectively doubled the salary threshold for mandatory overtime pay from $23, 660 to $47, 476 —  forcing employers to either pay many more workers overtime, or bump their salaries beyond the reach of the threshold. But with a new administration poised to take over, it looks like many of those workers won’t be getting higher pay after all. The implementation of the executive order was temporarily blocked by a federal judge in Texas back in November, and is now expected to be fully undone by Obama’s successor,   Donald Trump. While it’s not certain that Trump will roll back the  measure —  which would aid the many of the   voters that elected him —  the  ’s nomination of   executive Andy Puzder as his labor secretary suggests it’s a likely bet. As my colleague Alexia Campbell noted last month, Puzder has been a vocal critic of Obama’s overtime order saying that the measure “will simply add to the extensive regulatory maze the Obama Administration has imposed on employers, forcing many to offset increased labor expense by cutting costs elsewhere. ” Some employers aren’t waiting for official word from the federal government and have, in several cases, canceled raises that were meant to push workers salaries above the overtime threshold. “The clawbacks seem mainly to have occurred at nonprofits and smaller   businesses,” Politico’s Ted Hesson reported on Tuesday. According to Hesson, raises related to overtime have been rescinded at Massachusetts General Hospital, Iowa State University, the University of Iowa, Michigan State University, Rutgers University, the University of North Carolina Wilmington, Wayne State University in Michigan, and the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee. The expansion of overtime pay is a microcosm of the battling philosophies that animated voters during the 2016 election. Republicans, including Trump and Puzder, have characterized the rule as a   regulation, a hubristic act of bureaucratic overreach. Obama and Hillary Clinton, who supported the order, touted it as a small analgesic for underpaid and     workers. Like those currently insured under the Affordable Care Act or protected by immigration measures like the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) Americans impacted by the overtime pay rule —  or the raises to avoid it —  may see their plans upended by the transition of presidential power. But unlike those awaiting the federal government’s decisions on ACA or DACA, decisions about many pay raises can be made by independently by employers, without government policy. Some employers will choose to   with existing salary hikes: As The Washington Post reported last month, Walmart says it plans to keep the pay raises it instituted for   manager salaries. In September, the retailer bumped pay for the position to $48, 500 up from $45, 000 in order to avoid the   threshold. But others who were once promised similar raises may not be as lucky."
Obama Was Too Good at Social Media,Atlantic,Ian Bogost,2017-01-06,"President Obama has been called the “first   president. ” It’s both a true and a misleading characterization. On the one hand, the Obama White House was indeed the first presidency to make use of services like Twitter, Facebook, Snapchat, and Instagram. But on the other hand, these services either didn’t exist or weren’t used by a broad public before Barack Obama took office in 2009. The White House brags that Obama was the first to tweet from @POTUS on Twitter, to go live on Facebook, to use a filter on Snapchat. But in truth, any president in office during the last eight years probably would have become the first   president. That doesn’t mean that any president would have been good at it, however. John F. Kennedy is widely considered the first television president, but he wasn’t the first one to appear on TV. Franklin Roosevelt was the first president to appear on television, and Truman was the first, in 1947, to make a televised presidential address. But it was Kennedy who mastered the medium, starting with his famous televised debate with Richard Nixon in 1960, and continuing with the televised news conferences and interviews that characterized his presidency. Like JFK was good at TV, Obama is good at social media. Before his presidency, Obama was already inseparable from his BlackBerry, and as a   “nerd” and “geek,” his interest in science and technology helped spur his administration to pursue and manage public communication and engagement with today’s digital services and tools. But what if Obama was too good at social media? Maybe America didn’t need a   president, but a president whose technological savvy could apply to legislation and governance as much as public communication. * * * Last October, the White House announced a “digital transition” —  the process by which the Obama presidency would hand over the reins to its various   accounts, their followers kept intact, while also resetting and archiving their former contents in compliance with the Presidential Records Act. Normally, such preservation seals materials up in physical repositories, such as those maintained at the National Archives or the various presidential libraries. But the Obama White House hoped to “ensure these materials continue to be accessible on the platforms where they were created,” a savvy acknowledgement of the fact that a tweet or an Instagram post doesn’t make sense stripped from its context. In addition to these expected steps, the White House also expressed its commitment to share its   content with the American people —  both via accessible, downloadable archives, where possible, and also through tools and gadgets that might present the content in new and synthetic ways. In service of the latter goal, the White House invited the public to submit “creative ways to archive this content and make it both useful and available for years to come. ” The White House demonstrated remarkable astuteness toward this end, both culturally and rhetorically. It explicitly invited “students, data engineers, artists, and researchers” to contribute —  just the communities likely to feel adept and engaged with the technological sphere. It reaffirmed that the Obama administration was up on the latest trends, suggesting Twitter bots, query tools, and metadata services as examples of possible submissions. It used keywords commensurate with the values and rhetoric of the technology community. And most importantly, it issued the call in the form of a   contest, of sorts: submissions were to be completed “no later than   [2016],” or about two months after the call was first issued. History is slow, but technology is fast. Despite the real purpose of a presidential archive —  to produce an accessible record for posterity —  The White House knew that urgency would give it one last chance to tout Obama’s technological acumen to the public. The results are now in. This week, the White House announced the “innovative” archival projects they selected from the December submissions. And for anyone who follows and enjoys technology services, the results are indeed delightful. The GIF search engine Giphy created a landing page for   animated GIFs and White House Vines (the   short video service that shut down last fall). The archiving platform ArchiveSocial launched a search engine that consolidates queries across all the White House social media platforms. Students at the University of Texas, Austin and NYU’s Interactive Telecommunications Program (ITP) announced plans for an “Obamathon” hackathon, to take place today. And the creative technology studio Feel Train announced @Relive44, a Twitter account that will repost White House tweets in real time over the next eight years. The MIT Media Lab’s Electome project offers a visualization of how @POTUS communicated with citizens. The language White House Office of Digital Strategy Director of Product Management (and former Facebook employee) Joshua Miller used to announce the projects could just as easily  have been penned by a Silicon Valley tech entrepreneur in a Kickstarter campaign or a Medium post. Innovation is celebrated, along with the wherewithal of students, companies, and organizations to “answer this call to action” to tell the story of how the Obama presidency has used digital platforms for civic engagement. As is common practice in politics as much as technology, the unpaid labor of volunteers is heralded as the great promise of the current and future historical project. The White House hopes, Miller writes, “that their creations would inspire people (like you) to dive into the archives themselves. ” In its final act, the first Social Media presidency offers an Obamaesque nod to the values of the technology industry it used to the point of obsession. * * * To sneer at the White House’s efforts in this regard is sure to make me seem like a spoilsport or a killjoy. Haven’t you been charmed by the Barack and Michelle GIFs at GIPHY? Won’t you find Feel Train’s performance of Obama’s tweets both tender and wry in their future juxtapositions? Will ArchiveSocial’s search tool not prove useful to amateur and professional historians alike? Yes, of course. But these projects also affirm the dark underbelly of the social media era. The compression of complex ideas into tweetable  . The victory of sentiment and affect over reason and fact on the internet. The belief that large information archives can produce knowledge of the present, and of history, by exalting data correlation over all other methods of knowledge production. The tendency to privilege technological discourse over all other topics. The celebration of   contests and hackathons, pursued with an entrepreneur’s   attention, as the ultimate means of invention. The silent privileging of those with the time and resources to jump at the invitation to work for free, on no notice, over a period of weeks to curry favor and attention. For all the tweets and Facebook posts and YouTube videos and Pinterest pins and Snapchat snaps the Obama White House produced and disseminated, the main work it did was to further establish the unquestioned utility and righteousness of digital communications technology in the modern era. Citizens are dazzled and drawn to an image of Barack Obama staring into a smartphone or looped in a short GIF or Vine because such images condone and affirm their own fixation with these technologies. Even when those technologies dramatically alter civic and personal life, as companies like Facebook, Google, and Twitter have also done since 2008. As Obama leaves office, the digital tools he quietly celebrated have also hollowed out American life. Surveillance capitalism has made data extraction, aggregation, resale, and speculation the hidden engine of wealth and progress (for those few fortunate enough to pursue rather than to be pursued by it). The ability to create and widely disseminate information as credible and accurate, no matter its relationship to reality. The obsession with immediacy and attention over longevity and conviction. The consolidation of media and information, particularly local media, in the hands of a few large companies with limited commitment to civic good. While the first social media presidency was busy tweeting and Snapchatting, supposedly for public engagement, it did precious little to address the impacts of these and other effects of technology on the American public as matters of public policy. Ultimately, history will judge the 44th president, online and off. But instead of the “first social media presidency,” I wonder if Obama’s legacy won’t instead be that of the “cool dad presidency. ” What people liked about Obama’s relationship to technology is that it was so much like their own. Obama was relatable and  . He clutched his smartphone as much as anyone. He could make a post go viral and deserve it. But maybe what America needed from 2009 to 2017 wasn’t a cool dad to tweet and stream alongside its citizens. Maybe it needed a guardian to watch and safeguard it against its own worst habits."
Obama’s Anger Translator Takes a Final Bow,Atlantic,Megan Garber,2017-01-06,"There’s perhaps been no better satire of the Obama presidency than the figure of Luther, Obama’s anger translator. Key  Peele’s serialized sketch, in which the title character says all the things Obama won’t and can’t say as president, was multifaceted in its insights: about the performative demands of the office, about Obama’s own cool demeanor, about the collision of all those things in the person of the country’s first black president. Key  Peele’s Luther sketches —  including, and perhaps especially, the one performed with the actual President Obama, at the 2015 White House Correspondents’ Dinner —  were, in all that, as profound as they were wacky, and as much about the country Obama governed as they were about the president himself. Since that country elected a new president in November, Key  Peele fans have been clamoring for a return of the character —  to “translate” the calm, hopeful messages Obama has been sending about the transition into some angry (and, in that, cathartic)  . On Thursday evening, during   Key’s appearance on The Daily Show, they got their wish: After a brief conversation with Trevor Noah, Key introduced the sketch he had made with Jordan Peele —  one in which Peele’s “Obama” gives his final address to the nation as its president. One in which Luther, as always, is there to translate. Trevor Noah Finds His   Voice, It’s everything you’d expect of such a sketch, expertly executed. Obama informs Luther to keep calm Luther is completely unable to do so. “Don’t you understand?” Luther asks. “This is how The Hunger Games starts!” To Obama’s exhortations that now someone else will be calling the shots, Luther screams, “Yeah! Vladimir Putin!” To the president’s reminder that “it was a close election, but the people have spoken,” Luther replies, “Yeah! They voted for Hillary Clinton, but then this outdated electoral college   voodoo bull[bleep]!” and walks out of the room in uncontainable exasperation. To Obama’s note that “it’s more imperative than ever that we move on as a country united,” Luther replies “united in the fact that we can’t [bleep] stand each other!” So the   Luther sketch is made mostly the stuff of the   versions: “No drama Obama,” next to the      Luther. But as the sketch wraps up —  as “Obama” concludes his farewell address to the nation —  the whole thing pivots. It’s Obama who gets angry. It’s Obama who, more significantly, no longer feels the need to disguise that anger. When Luther excoriates the new president’s immigration policy —  “the only good immigrant is a   white one!” —  Obama ads, “who plagiarizes speeches. ” Luther stands in a moment of stunned silence as he realizes that the president has left nothing for him to translate. Later, Obama mentions the tradition of the outgoing president leaving the incoming one a note, in the desk of the Oval Office, offering advice. The contents of that note have been confidential, Obama says, “until now. ” Luther grabs the note out of the president’s hand and reveals that the message Obama has left to President Trump reads, “Go [bleep] yourself. ” It was, for a series of sketches that has always operated on several dimensions, a fitting conclusion: In Luther’s (ostensibly) final appearance, he cedes his outrage to the president himself —  who, soon to be freed of the many constraints of his office, seems to be out of patience with the requirement that he keep his cool. After eight years of partisan gamesmanship, and eight years of stoicism, Key  Peele’s version of Obama has had it with all the  . He no longer needs someone to translate his anger. “In summation,” the outgoing president tells the nation, “it’s been real. It’s been good. But it hasn’t been real good. ”"
Why Do Humans Still Have a Gene That Increases the Risk of Alzheimer’s?,Atlantic,Ed Yong,2017-01-06,"When the former nurse Jamie Tyrone learned that she carried two copies of a gene called ApoE4, she “lost hope and direction,” and her “days were filled with fear, anxiety and sadness. ” It meant that as she got older, she would likely develop Alzheimer’s disease, as her father had done before her. The apoliprotein E gene, or ApoE, comes in three forms —  E2, E3, and E4. The last one is the problem. People who carry one copy have a   higher risk of Alzheimer’s than those with none. And those with two copies, as Tyrone carries, have   to   higher risks. Between 51 and 68 percent of them will develop the disease by the time they are 85. The risk is so large that some people who get their genomes analyzed (including James Watson, a   of the DNA double helix) deliberately decide to redact their ApoE4 sequence. They’d rather not know.   Even if ApoE4 carriers manage to dodge Alzheimer’s, they aren’t out of the woods. Compared to the general population, they tend to have higher cholesterol levels, a higher risk of heart disease, and a faster pace of mental decline during old age. Despite all these drawbacks, the ApoE4 variant is surprisingly common. A quarter of white Americans carry a single copy, as do more than a third of African Americans. In other parts of the world, especially in the tropics and in northern Europe, the variant is even more common. “It doesn’t make sense,” says Ben Trumble, from Arizona State University. “You’d have thought that natural selection would have weeded out ApoE4 a long time ago. The fact that we have it at all is a little bizarre. ” Trumble has now found an answer to this puzzle after studying the Tsimane, a group of indigenous people from the Bolivian Amazon. They live traditional lifestyles involving   horticulture, fishing, and foraging. They don’t have access to sanitation or running water, and more than   of them are infected with worms and other intestinal parasites. Among the Tsimane with the heaviest parasite burdens, ApoE4 actually protects against mental decline in old age. The variant has been described by some publication as “the forgetting gene,” but that’s because scientists have mostly studied it in Western and Asian populations. Among the   Tsimane, it’s more of a “the remembering gene. ” Trumble’s team has been studying the Tsimane since 1999 to see how their health compares to people from urban Western societies. He and his colleagues travel between the 90 or so communities with a team of Bolivian doctors and biochemists, and a few Tsimane whom they trained as anthropologists. They draw blood, collect stool samples, and do medical exams. They check for parasite infections by measuring levels of immune cells. And recently, they interviewed 372 villagers between the ages of 6 and 88, giving them a battery of tests designed to measure their attention, memory, and other mental skills.   Among the Tsimane as a whole, adults with E4 got poorer scores in these tests. But when the team focused on the people with high parasite levels, they saw that the E4 carriers had better mental skills, even outperforming E3 carriers who were  .   It’s not clear why. The ApoE gene affects the movement of cholesterol and fatty acids through the brain. Perhaps the E4 variant keeps these nutrients away from parasites and so keeps their populations in check. That might, in turn, protect the brain. “Having parasites is bad for cognitive performance,” says Trumble. “If you’re having to spend a bunch of energy on ramping up your immune system, those are calories you can’t spend on growth. ”   Even with 372 volunteers, the team’s study is small, but they’ve been working to increase their numbers by almost four times. “That’s the big problem with   studies,” says Trumble. “In most   populations, there just aren’t enough older individuals. The Tsimane are an interesting test case because more than 1, 300 are over 40. And since they have no birth control, and now access to metal axes and motorized canoes, they’re growing faster than the baby boom in the U. S. That’s one of the reasons we started working with them. ” “It’s consistent with other studies indicating that E4 isn’t always the bad guy,” says Ruth Itzhaki, from the University of Manchester, whose own work showed that E4 might protect against liver damage caused by hepatitis C. Other researchers have found that   children in Brazilian shanty towns did better in mental tests when carrying intestinal parasites, while those in Mexico City were better able to cope with lead exposure. This doesn’t explain why E4 remains common in many Western populations, but it does at least hint that the variant might be beneficial in other contexts that we haven’t discovered. Indeed, E4 seems to be the original version of the ApoE gene, which existed at the dawn of humanity before the E2 and E3 versions arose. For most of our history, we had to cope with parasites galore, and perhaps the E4 variant helped our ancestors to cope with that burden, as it seems to do in today’s Tsimane. And perhaps the variant’s benefits that have since diminished as some societies embraced sanitation, clean water, and refrigeration. “This highlights the importance of accounting for the wide variety of environments in which humans lived for most of our evolution, and in which we currently live,” says Trumble. “  city life is just a blip in our history. ”"
Trump vs. the Spies,Atlantic,Amy Zegart,2017-01-06,"Something stunning happened on Capitol Hill yesterday: Republican and Democratic members of the Senate Armed Services Committee practically stood shoulder to shoulder with senior officials from the U. S. intelligence community as they declared that America’s spies were right after all: The Russian government sought to interfere in the U. S. presidential election by hacking into   email and leaking information. It was a striking bipartisan rebuke to   Donald Trump, who has consistently cast skepticism on allegations of Russian involvement and seemed to disparage the intelligence community. Perhaps in anticipation of that committee hearing, Trump was already backpedaling on Twitter before it started, declaring, “The media lies to make it look like I am against ‘Intelligence’ when in fact I am a big fan!” What Did the Senate Hearing Reveal About Russian Hacking? Trump’s “never mind” tweet is unlikely to repair the dangerous breach between the incoming president and the intelligence agencies that serve him. Presidents often throw intelligence agencies under the bus when they fail. Never before has a   thrown them under the bus for succeeding. But that’s exactly what Trump has been doing for weeks, in an unrelenting frenzy. Since his election, Trump has spent more time fighting Langley than ISIS. He has called the CIA’s assessment of the Russian government’s role in election hacking “ridiculous” and has insisted, repeatedly, that the culprit could be anyone, including a   hacker or “somebody sitting in a bed some place. ” His transition team has disparaged and discredited the CIA as “the same people who thought Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction” —  even though they aren’t the same people, Russian cyber hacking isn’t the same intelligence target as Iraq WMD, the Iraq failure was 14 years ago, and intelligence agencies have radically overhauled their analytic process since then. The   has also said he won’t bother getting daily intelligence briefings —  making him the first president since   to skip them —  because he’s smart. And just a day before Trump declared himself an intelligence fan, The Wall Street Journal reported that his team was cooking up a   scheme to purge the CIA and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence of suspected politicization in the ranks by trimming and reorganizing both agencies. (The Trump team has denied this report, which was based on the accounts of sources “familiar with the planning,” including at least one close to the transition.) With fans like this, who needs enemies? Some skepticism toward intelligence is healthy. And tension between presidents and their intelligence agencies is nothing new. Lyndon Johnson was said to compare the intelligence community to his boyhood cow, Bessie, who would swing her “shit smeared” tail through a bucket of milk as soon as he’d finished milking her. Bill Clinton met so infrequently with his CIA Director, Jim Woolsey, that when a plane crashed on the White House lawn, aides joked that it was Woolsey trying to get a meeting. (Woolsey, incidentally, had been advising the Trump transition team until resigning yesterday, reportedly due to “growing tensions over Trump’s vision for intelligence agencies. ”) Nearly all presidents leave office disappointed and disgruntled with their intelligence apparatus, for two reasons: because presidents want crystal balls and even the CIA’s smartest people don’t have them and because presidents resort to covert operations for the toughest of problems, when all else fails —  which is why covert operations usually fail, too. But no president until now has entered office with such a profound, publicly vented distrust of his own intelligence establishment. Trump’s doubts are both understandable and alarming. Understandable because we live in an era where threats are moving faster than bureaucrats, and where hacks, tweets, leaks, and internet “news” (both real and fake) make information available everywhere, all the time, instantly. In this digital age, it is reasonable to ask just what America’s intelligence community still brings to the table. The answer is a lot. U. S. intelligence agencies have one overriding mission: giving the president   advantage in a dangerous and deceptive world. Intelligence officials risk their lives to recruit foreign assets, they intercept foreign email and   communications, they build and deploy spy satellites, they track obscure foreign government reports and trends for vital clues about the stability of a regime or the health of a foreign economy. Sure, you can find a Wikipedia page on just about anything these days. Where intelligence agencies add value is by integrating the best   information and integrating it with the secret nuggets they gather. All intelligence is information. But not all information is intelligence. Agencies like the CIA or NSA sort through a crushing daily stream of information and marry it with secrets to yield insights that keep Americans safe and advance the country’s national interests. Do they get it wrong sometimes? Of course. In 1962, just weeks before an American   spy plane discovered unmistakable evidence of Soviet nuclear missile installations in Cuba, the intelligence community completed an assessment that concluded the Soviets would not dare place missiles in Cuba. Today Americans remember the   photos but forget the intelligence failure that preceded them and led the United States to the nuclear brink. The intelligence failures of   and Iraq WMD are still fresh and searing. But castigating intelligence officials because they don’t succeed every time is like saying Stephen Curry is a terrible NBA basketball player because he doesn’t make every   shot he takes. Intelligence agencies are paid to pierce the fog of the future as best they can. They tackle the toughest targets —  trying to divine the capabilities and intentions of adversaries who hide in caves, send children to be suicide bombers, enrich uranium in secret underground facilities, seek space weapons that could destroy GPS and every digital system people use, and would detonate a nuclear bomb in a New York minute to take out New York City if they ever got one. As one former senior intelligence official told me, if the intelligence community is getting it right 100 percent of the time, then they should be fired because they aren’t asking hard enough questions. This is serious business, and intelligence agencies take it deadly seriously. They are the silent warriors of America. There’s no holiday in their honor. There’s no big public memorial on the National Mall. There are no Air Force flyovers or standing ovations at football games for them. There are only unmarked stars on the walls at Langley and Fort Meade honoring those at CIA and NSA who died in silent service to their country. Mr. Trump should visit those walls and feel their sacrifice. Better yet, he should honor America’s intelligence professionals by listening to what they have to say —  starting with the daily intelligence briefing. The president cannot afford to delegate intelligence briefings to underlings in today’s threat environment, for three reasons that Mr. Trump should know well from his experience in the business world. First, nothing generates knowledge and results like    meetings. That’s why CEOs fly around the world to meet in person instead of Skyping. Whether in the boardroom or the Oval Office, good briefings are   interactions that build trust and insight. They’re golden moments for a senior intelligence official to converse with the nation’s leader, to better understand what’s on his mind, what he wants to know, what he finds unconvincing, and how the vast assets of the intelligence community can better serve him. Second, good briefings inform —  they arm the    with a view of what matters right now and what could matter tomorrow, so that he isn’t surprised. Because in foreign policy, surprises are never the good kind. Third and finally, the daily briefing boosts morale. It says to the men and women of the intelligence community, “you matter. ” Nothing signals importance like minutes of the president’s schedule. Given the dangers America confronts, the nation needs the intelligence community now more than ever. The 45th president needs to show that he thinks so, too."
Obama’s Final Jobs Report Marks 75 Consecutive Months of Growth,Atlantic,Bourree Lam,2017-01-06,"The final jobs report for 2016 shows that the U. S. economy has added just over 2 million jobs last year. The Labor Department reported on Friday morning that the U. S. economy added 156, 000 jobs in December, while the unemployment rate ticked up slightly to 4. 7 percent. The numbers slightly missed expectations: Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal were expecting 183, 000 jobs to be added. Nevertheless, the December jobs report concludes a year of steady economic growth: For most of the year, the unemployment rate has been hovering just under 5 percent, the lowest levels since 2007. Although the pace of employment growth in 2016 slowed compared to 2014 and 2015 —  the height of the economic recovery —  last year’s numbers put outgoing President Barack Obama ahead of George W. Bush (but behind Bill Clinton) when it comes to job creation. In 2009, when Obama took office, the U. S. labor market was facing   unemployment —  the highest since the early 1980s recession —  and job losses due to the financial crisis. In January of 2009 —  the month Obama was inaugurated —  the American economy lost 791, 000 jobs. Now —  eight years later —  the U. S. has experienced 75 consecutive months of job growth. “When President Obama took office we were losing 800, 000 jobs a month. The job loss associated with the Great Recession was enormous, but a record long recovery has put people back to work including the   unemployed and those who left the labor force,” said Betsey Stevenson, a labor economist at the University of Michigan and former member of Obama’s Council of Economic Advisors, in an email. “Unemployment is low, wages are rising, and     participation is recovering. ” Wages were an especially important indicator in 2016, since the improving labor market should, theoretically, increase pay for American workers. There’s been some improvement on that front: In December, average hourly earnings reached a high of $26. 00, compared with $24. 76 in January of this year. For the year, wage growth amounted to 2. 9 percent —  the strongest since the recession. Harry Holzer, former chief economist of the U. S. Department of Labor and author of Where Are All The Good Jobs Going? echoed Stevenson’s sentiments. “The job market has almost totally recovered from its devastating decline during the Great Recession   …     significant wage growth, which was lacking early in the recovery, has returned,” he said in an email. Job creation has been particularly good in the private sector. “During the past 8 years, the labor market has steadily created jobs —  adding 11 million jobs. Today, the labor market is tightening, and we are approaching near ” said Ahu Yildirmaz, the lead economist and head of ADP Research Institute (which puts together the   jobs report). Yildirmaz says that according to ADP’s data, small and   companies in the U. S. created the most jobs since 2008. Still, several sectors —  such as energy and manufacturing —  continue to struggle. Stevenson says that the trouble in these sectors will require innovative ways of approaching the changing job market. “The challenge for the future will be solving the mismatch between the types of jobs people used to have and the types of jobs the economy is currently creating,” she said. When he takes office later this month,   Donald Trump will be inheriting a strong economy. During the campaign, Trump often painted a dire portrait of the American economy despite statistics showing a strong labor market, an increase in American household incomes, and rising consumer confidence. Critics of Obama’s job market performance often point to the drop in   participation and the rise in underemployment as weak spots in the U. S. labor market, as proof that there’s still room for improvement. While   participation has seen some declines in the past few years, it was steady throughout the year. In December, it hovered at 62. 7 percent, which is near a   low. The root cause of declining participation remains disputed, with demographics and discouraged workers cited as some of the possible explanations. In 2017, the   participation number will likely remain a major focus. “About half of the decline reflects Baby Boomers whose retirements we anticipated it’s the other half, among   workers, that we worry about most,” said Holzer. “It is possible that the   participation rate among   workers might improve just a bit more. But the improvements will be limited for two reasons: First, we are approaching the limit in labor supply of workers who are available and who have the skills needed for existing openings and second, growth in demand will be limited as interest rates rise. ” Yildirmaz at ADP also points to the limits in labor supply: “The greatest challenge employers will face in 2017 will be finding skilled workers in the tightening labor market,” says Yildirmaz. A recent ADP study found that 80 percent of employers believe their top management challenges stem from the shortage of skilled workers. Overall, 2016 has been a good year for the U. S. labor market. Looking forward to 2017, there’s evidence that the job market can continue to gain strength. Some economists expect that   Trump’s promised fiscal stimulus will bring   job growth. But with the Federal Reserve likely raising interest rates to keep inflation in check, the impact of the stimulus on   growth might be hampered. In the recently released minutes of the latest Federal Reserve Open Market Committee meeting, members said that potential fiscal stimulus from the new administration would inform how the committee chooses to adjust interest rates in the future."
Ranked: Twitter Wars That Came a Little Too Close to Real Wars,Atlantic,Matt Peterson,2017-01-06,"A fun new feature of 2017 is that Twitter is getting a lot more dangerous. With Donald Trump leading the charge, individuals who control actual armies have started shooting from the hip on social media. We are yet to see a real war come out of a Twitter war, but at the rate we’re going, it won’t be long. Here are five instances in which politicians ratcheted up global tensions in 140 characters or less. 5. Iran menaces Obama. In 2015, Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, tweeted an image of a man resembling Barack Obama holding a gun to his head: “We welcome no war, nor do we initiate any war, but. .. ” The threat falls into the category of calculated menace: aggressive, to be sure, but given the intense focus by all sides on the state of U. S.  relations, it would be hard for words to spill over into   actions. At least, it’s been hard under the Obama administration. 2017 may be different. 2016: The Year in Quotes, 4. Greece snaps at Turkey. In the midst of a diplomatic uproar after Turkey shot down a Russian plane flying missions in Syria, Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras —  or someone with access to his Twitter account —  decided to escalate matters further. In a series of   tweets, Tspiras alluded to shooting down Turkish planes that violated Greek airspace: “Fortunately our pilots are not as mercurial as yours. ” The Turkish leader, apparently having enough on his hands with the Russians, all but rolled his eyes and urged a focus on the positive agenda. The path from tweet to war is a long one in this case, but when your neighbor is actively shooting down airplanes, it might be wise not to stick up your hand and say, “Me, too!” 3.   erupts. Tensions spiked last fall when Baghdad started to vigorously protest the presence of uninvited Turkish troops in northern Iraq. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, in characteristically undiplomatic style, chose to respond by insulting Iraqi Prime Minister Haider   insisting that the Iraqi is “not on my level. ” Abadi responded on Twitter: “we sure are not your equal, because we liberate our land with men not via Skype. ” That low blow referred to the video call Erdogan made at the height of last summer’s coup attempt against him, when he was trying to rally his supporters. Compared to U. S.  relations, the danger is more real here, as   tensions could more easily escalate. Though the dispute remains unresolved, the two have opted to take their arguments offline and have since spoken by phone. 2. Pakistan threatens Israel. Late last month, Pakistan’s defense minister, Khawaja Muhammad Asif, apparently read a fake news story alleging that Israel would nuke Pakistan if Islamabad sent troops into Syria. Ignoring the absurdity of the premise, Asif took to Twitter to warn his Israeli counterpart: “Israel forgets Pakistan is a Nuclear state too. ” The Israelis wrote back attempting to   and Asif ultimately thought better of it and deleted his tweet. But the danger in this type of incident is particularly acute: Unlike Khamenei’s calculated aggression, in the Pakistani case, someone in power reacted online without thinking. That’s how accidental escalation happens. 1. Trump goes nuclear. 2017 is shaping up to be a year of resurgent nuclear politics. Exhibit A is this recent Trump tweet: “The United States must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes. ” Though Trump’s precise meaning is in dispute —  arguably, he could be referring to modernizing the nuclear arsenal —  political scientists will tell you it doesn’t matter. If states with nuclear weapons, and those that aspire to join the club, perceive that an arms race is likely, they have incentives to join the race so to avoid being left behind. Plus, the  ’s words alone force the U. S. national security community to focus on nuclear weapons. Is it too late to suggest that we #nevertweet? This article has been adapted from Matt Peterson’s weekly newsletter for Eurasia Group, Signal."
The USSR’s Futurist Film and Sweden’s Sweet Tooth: The Week in Global-Affairs Writing,Atlantic,Anna Diamond,2017-01-06,"Nomads No More: Why Mongolian Herders Are Moving to the CityPatrick Kingsley | The Guardian“Look down on Ulaanbaatar from the hills at its edge, and you will see a central hotchpotch of new skyscrapers and crumbling Soviet tower blocks surrounded by an unplanned periphery of white yurts, or, as they are known in Mongolia, gers. Thousands and thousands of gers. These are the homes of around 600, 000 former herders who —  like Altansukh —  have migrated to the Mongolian capital in the past three decades.

President Vladimir Putin, who has overtly stated his aversion to revolution, has been trying to come up with a way to celebrate the one that defined modern Russia. It’s a far cry from what Soviet leaders thought this year would be. Back in the U. S. S.

Amid all the threats, school can be their only refuge. Education is a challenge because of the fees, but it is also a source of hope. A high school degree can give them more economic freedom and a chance to forge their own lives, perhaps by enabling them to attend a university or get jobs that require more skills.

Once a week, Swedes are given a free pass to indulge in all the gummies, chocolates, and salty liquorice their Nordic hearts desire. (  hearts will most likely take a pass on the salty liquorice.)

Silence Is Easier to Admire Than to Love,Atlantic,Christopher Orr,2017-01-06,"   Silence, the new film by Martin Scorsese, opens with almost as literal a vision of Hell as one could imagine. The year is 1633 the place, a craggy, volcanic expanse near Nagasaki called Unzen. Through the sulphur fumes and scalding vapor, we see European men, their hands tied, being led by Japanese soldiers to the boiling springs that dot the landscape. Their robes are parted and searing water poured on their skin. In voiceover, it is explained that the ladles used are perforated such that each individual drop may strike the skin “like a burning coal. ” The springs themselves are called, aptly enough, jogoku, or “hells. ” The man narrating this excruciating torture is Father Cristóvão Ferreira (Liam Neeson) a Jesuit missionary. The victims, who number in the dozens, are his fellow Catholic priests. Christianity has been outlawed as a threat to Japanese culture and it is being burned out of the country in the most direct manner available. Martin Scorsese’s Radical Act of Turning Theology Into Art  Father Ferreira’s observations are committed to a letter, and it is in that context that we hear them again. It is now 1640, seven years after the horrors he recounted, and a senior Jesuit (Ciarán Hinds) is reading the letter to two young priests who were once Ferreira’s pupils, Sebastião Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) and Francisco Garupe (Adam Driver). The elder priest also informs them that Ferreira subsequently disappeared and is rumored to have “apostatized” —  that is, renounced God. Rodrigues and Garupe refuse to believe this of their beloved mentor, and they vow to find him and dispel the slander. Their superior accedes to their mission, though he reminds them of the extraordinary danger they will face from the moment they set foot in Japan: “You will be the last two priests ever sent. ” Silence is based on the celebrated 1966 novel of the same name by Shūsaku Endō, and Scorsese has been vowing to bring it to the big screen ever since he first read the book in 1989. At the time, he was dealing with the blowback to his controversial The Last Temptation of Christ, and in Endō’s story of faith and doubt, he felt echoes of both his recent experience and his longtime relationship with the Church, of which he had once intended to become a priest. Nearly 30 years in the making, Silence is a heartfelt and serious work. But through length and redundancy —  both, no doubt, the product of Scorsese’s deep admiration for Endō —  as well as an underwhelming central performance by Garfield, it ultimately falls short of its powerful ambitions. The two priests, Rodrigues and Garupe, are smuggled into Japan by Kichijiro (Yōsuke Kubozuka) a fickle and intemperate drunk. (There is a noticeable echo of the legendary Toshiro Mifune in the performance.) There, they encounter a town populated by secret Christians, and their mission begins to shift, from finding and rescuing Ferreira to ministering to these devout peasants, who live in terror of discovery by the authorities. The Japan of these early scenes —  conjured by the cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto —  is a misery of rock and rain, in which   villages can hope for little more than not to be swept entirely out to sea. Eventually, official “inquisitors” do come to the town in which the priests are hiding, and the two men are forced to split up. For the remainder of the film, we follow the journey of Rodrigues as he witnesses atrocities against his fellow Christians —  crucifixions, drownings, a beheading —  grapples with his own faith, and is himself captured. Most of all, he suffers from the apparent “silence” with which God answers his prayers. The tradeoff repeatedly extended by the authorities to those suspected of Christian belief would seem a simple one. Just place one’s foot on a   a small plaque bearing a likeness of Christ or the Virgin, and one will escape punishment and perhaps be freed. Refuse, and one will face torture or worse. Many of the peasants questioned refuse to step on the   and suffer accordingly. But many are willing to make that concession —  and are, in fact encouraged by Rodrigues to do so —  in order to keep their lives. Among the latter is the priests’ initial guide, Kichijiro, whose continued vacillation between apostasy and confession makes him one of the film’s more infuriating and provocatively human figures. As is no doubt apparent, Silence is not an easy film to watch, its   running time awash in images of pain and cruelty. But neither is it a mere cinematic exercise in physical endurance or the punishments of the flesh, such as Unbroken or even The Revenant. Scorsese is attempting something far more interesting: a portrait of the endurance of the soul. It is not, after all, Rodrigues’s body that is being tormented, but those of the people around him. And it is made abundantly clear that it is within his power to make it stop if only he will himself apostatize. As the chief inquisitor, Inoue, cunningly played by Issey Ogata, explains: “We learned from our mistakes. Killing priests only makes them stronger. ” Another interrogator puts it still more directly when Rodrigues insists that the victims around him “didn’t die for nothing. ” “No,” he replies. “They died for you. ” But for all the torments they inflict, the Japanese inquisitors are no generic movie villains. They truly believe that Christianity is incompatible with the Japanese spirit, an alien pathogen imported by arrogant and incurious Europeans. And the film gives this case its due. It is notable, for instance, that none of the Jesuits we encounter speaks more than a tiny smattering of Japanese, but peasants and inquisitors alike manage to make themselves understood in Portuguese (rendered in the film as English). One of Rodrigues’s captors —  played superbly by Tadanobu Asano —  is fluent enough to function as a   translator. Indeed, one of the chief weaknesses of Silence is that so many of the characters in orbit around Rodrigues convey more narrative gravity than he does himself: Asano’s translator, Ogata’s inquisitor, Kubozuka’s fickle Kichijiro, Driver’s Father Garupe, a village elder played by Yoshi Oida. Andrew Garfield is a fine actor, but his calling card has always been a kind of boyish ingenuousness, and here it is tested beyond its limits. Garfield’s previous major role of the year, Hacksaw Ridge, is illustrative. In it, as in Silence, he plays a devout Christian —  one who served as an Army medic in World War II and, despite his refusal to carry a firearm, rescued 75 of his gravely injured comrades from the battlefield. But in Hacksaw Ridge, this Christian spirit was emphatic, uplifting, a source of   strength. It was the solution to the problem at hand. In Silence, by contrast, Garfield faces the far heavier challenge of grappling with the possibility that it might be the problem. Far from saving lives, Rodrigues’s faith is costing them. Scorsese does Garfield no favors by extending his protagonist’s torments to such extreme lengths. The film is full of moments that, for all their elegance and power, feel repetitive: yet another scene of peasants being commanded to step on the   another brutal torture another confrontation between Rodrigues and the inquisitors in which each side talks past the other —  universal truth versus cultural difference —  without success. These philosophical disputes, too, rarely achieve the depth or richness for which one hopes. Late in the film it is suggested, intriguingly, that perhaps the Christian faith of the Japanese peasants isn’t really Christian at all, that due to a   error of translation, they worship not the “Son,” but the “Sun. ” Alas, Scorsese’s film is more interested in cataloguing Rodrigues’s ongoing spiritual anguishes than in pulling further on such theological threads. It all comes to an end —  though I should warn, there’s still a   left —  when Rodrigues finally completes his mission and learns the fate of his mentor, Father Ferreira. I will not reveal what he discovers, but I will say that it feels like a moment that could easily have taken place far earlier in the film. Let there be no misunderstanding: Silence is an indisputably worthy film from one of our greatest living directors, one that searchingly tackles questions of faith and doubt and duty. The visuals supplied by Prieto are themselves worth the price of admission —  the desperate peasants crawling up over the side of a boat, like pirates or mermen a town abandoned to a community of feral cats a sea cave that functions like a portal from one world to the next. Scorsese’s abiding passion and respect for his source material is everywhere in evidence. For once, perhaps, it is a little too great."
Mnuchin’s Bank Was Reprimanded by the Same Department He May Lead,Atlantic,Alexia Fernández Campbell,2017-01-06,"In 2011, at the peak of the housing crisis, regulators for the Treasury Department ordered Steve Mnuchin and directors at OneWest Bank in California to fix the bank’s questionable handling of home loans. In a consent order filed that year by the department’s Office of Thrift Supervision, regulators accused the bank of using “unsafe or unsound” methods for dealing with mortgage loans and foreclosures in 2009 and 2010. They found that bank employees and   providers lied in foreclosure paperwork filed in state and federal courts about information related to the ownership of many home loans, money due on the loans, and the fees chargeable to the borrower. They also accused employees of filing court documents with signatures that were not notarized and initiating foreclosures and bankruptcies without all the necessary paperwork. The office additionally claimed that the bank “failed to devote to its foreclosure processes adequate oversight, internal controls, policies, and procedures, compliance risk management, internal audit, third party management, and training. ” As a result of the examination, the Treasury Department’s Office of Thrift Supervision (which later merged into the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency) ordered the bank to work with an independent monitor to address these issues. That involved requiring Mnuchin and other bank executives to write rules about how employees are supposed to work with borrowers to handle foreclosures, creating a process to ensure employees’ statements in court documents are accurate, plus a long list of other rules to make sure employees don’t break the law. Regulators found the same problems at the nation’s largest mortgage lenders, including Bank of America and Citibank, and ordered them to do the same. OneWest complied with this legal order and in 2015, the Treasury Department released the bank from the monitoring agreement. Mnuchin —  a former   partner —  is now preparing to lead the same department that once reprimanded him for his banking practices. The Treasury Department’s findings mirror some of those found by state prosecutors in a 2013 memo leaked this week to the The Intercept, which alleges that Mnuchin’s bank broke foreclosure rules and engaged in “widespread misconduct” during the housing crisis. In the confidential memo,   lawyers for the California attorney general’s office claimed that employees at OneWest Bank were manipulating home auctions, failing to properly notify homeowners about foreclosure proceedings, and backdating signatures, possibly to speed up foreclosures. Of the 913 subpoenaed loan documents they reviewed, they found that 909 were likely backdated. Barney Keller, a spokesperson for Mnuchin, told me in an email that the Treasury Department’s findings are “garbage” and the leaked memo is “meritless. ” Regarding the regulatory findings, he said that “the exact same consent order was agreed to by all 14 of the major financial institutions that were heavily involved in the mortgage industry. This order required all of the institutions to complete the independent foreclosure review, which OneWest was the only bank to successfully complete. ”  While this is true, it’s important to note that, as a result of the review, OneWest still had to pay roughly $8. 5 million in remediation to more than 10, 000 customers for “errors that resulted in financial harm. ” Keller added that Mnuchin had ”helped modify over 100, 000 mortgages he did not even originate and in thousands of cases even reduced borrower principal.” Of course, banks in many cases were already required to do that. Mnuchin’s investment in OneWest Bank was a profitable one. He purchased the failed   bank, then known as IndyMac, in March of 2009 and renamed it OneWest. The purchase came with tens of thousands of troubled mortgage loans, most of which were  . These mortgages had monthly payments that ballooned during the housing crisis and led many homeowners to default. When prosecutors sent the confidential memo detailing their allegations to California’s   General Kamala Harris in 2013, OneWest had foreclosed on 35, 000 homes in the state and was in the process of foreclosing on another 45, 000. The results of the state’s investigation match many of those highlighted by the Treasury Department’s regulators, though California’s prosecutors went a step further by alleging that the bank was breaking the law, specifically the state’s Unfair Competition Law. In their memo, prosecutors for the state urged Harris, the attorney general, to sue the bank for unfair business practices, but she declined to take on the case, according to The Intercept. A review of federal court records shows that more than 800 lawsuits were filed against OneWest while Mnuchin owned the bank. About a third of those lawsuits came from homeowners who claimed that the bank improperly foreclosed on their properties. A recurring complaint was that the bank didn’t give owners a chance to modify their loans to avoid losing their homes, something the federal government required the banks to do. In a $5 million,   lawsuit filed in 2012, more than 100 homeowners sued OneWest Bank for refusing to modify their loans even though they met all the program’s requirements under the law, they claimed. They also accused bank staff of encouraging them to default on their mortgage payments to qualify for the   program, and telling them that the bank was missing documents that homeowners said they had already sent. “Because of OneWest’s breach, [plaintiffs] have been injured, including suffering negative credit consequences and some losing their homes through foreclosure sales that should have never occurred,” the complaint states. The bank, now under new ownership, settled the case this past August for an undisclosed amount. Other cases against the bank were dismissed or settled, and several remain open. In 2015, Mnuchin sold the bank, which Bloomberg estimates earned him $380 million in personal profit. It was a lucrative investment that now poses a huge hurdle for him during the confirmation process to become Treasury Secretary. Senator Ron Wyden, the lead Democrat on the committee that will hold his confirmation hearings, told The Wall Street Journal last month that Mnuchin has a “history of profiting off the victims of predatory lending. ” But while the hearings might become heated, if Mnuchin has enough support from Republicans, in the end that heat won’t really matter."
Kids Aren’t Interested in Moral Conflict,Atlantic,Christina Starmans,2017-01-06,"When was the last time you were tempted, even briefly, to do something a little immoral? To lie, betray a friend’s confidence, cut in line, or take a little more than your share? I’m willing to bet it was today. Maybe in the past hour. Larger temptations hound us too, especially those involving sex or money. And yet, perhaps to a shocking extent, we often rise above these temptations and act morally nonetheless. But how does the inner struggle with temptation affect how our actions are viewed by others? Who is the better person: the one who acts morally while tempted or the one who is never tempted at all? There are two strands of moral philosophy that, loosely speaking, make opposite predictions about which kinds of actions will be seen as most moral. One argument, associated with Aristotle, is that a truly moral person will wholeheartedly want to do the right thing, and no part of her will be tempted to act immorally. Another argument, associated with Immanuel Kant, is that an action is truly moral only if it is not something you want to do —  otherwise, a person is just acting on her own desires, and although the result might be positive, it should not be considered especially moral. These philosophers are arguing about which actions we should see as most moral. But which of these views best captures how ordinary people actually do reason about morality? To answer the question and uncover how people reason about overcoming temptation across a lifespan, my team recruited more than 250 children, aged three to eight years, and nearly 400 adults. Each participant was asked to consider several   scenarios depicting two characters who both acted morally. One story, for example, described two children who had each broken something of their mother’s. Both ultimately told their mother the truth about what they had done. And both children wanted to tell the truth, and wanted to do the right thing. But one child was also tempted to lie to avoid punishment, yet told the truth even though she found it difficult. The other child found it easy to tell the truth, and wasn’t tempted to lie, because she wasn’t concerned about the punishment. We then asked which of the two   was more morally praiseworthy. We found a striking developmental difference:   to    children judged that someone who does the right thing without experiencing immoral desires is morally superior to someone who does the right thing through overcoming conflicting desires —  but adults had the opposite intuition. And these judgments showed up across a number of different immoral temptations, including lying, not helping a sibling, and breaking a promise. They appeared whether we asked about which character should be rewarded for her actions, which character was “more good,” or which character was most likely to act morally in the future. That adults favored the conflicted character was somewhat surprising, because plenty of previous research has found that adults judge negative intentions and desires to be morally blameworthy. Yet here we have identified situations in which adults award more moral credit to people who have some negative desires, rather than only positive desires. This may be because, like Kant, adults see the desire to act immorally as an essential component of what makes a truly moral act instead of an enjoyable action that happens to have a positive result. In this view, it’s only when we want to be bad that we have the ability to choose good. Of course, there are other kinds of immoral temptations that adults might judge just as harshly as children. For example, a person who is tempted to molest a child but overcomes that temptation is unlikely to be seen as more moral than someone who was never tempted to molest a child in the first place. Uncovering the characteristics of temptations that lead to moral praise and those that lead to condemnation is something we are looking more closely at in continuing studies. Meanwhile, our findings to date suggest that children start out with an Aristotelian moral psychology, judging individuals who don’t struggle with moral decisions as more moral than those who do. But sometime after age eight, they transition to a more Kantian framework, judging the worth of moral actions according to how difficult the actions were for the actors. So what changes as we age? One possibility is that children lack firsthand experience with inner conflict. At first blush, this seems odd —  children certainly misbehave frequently, and so it might seem like they must be experiencing the temptation to act immorally all the time. But it might be that kids don’t often simultaneously experience both the desire to be bad and the desire to be good, and that gaining experience with this kind of personal inner struggle as they grow older helps them to value it, or at least not to condemn it, in others. A related factor might be a growing appreciation of willpower itself. Finally, and intriguingly, it might be that children inherently prefer people with a unified self. As we grow older, though, we come to appreciate the nuances of a more complex character that allows for both temptation and the willpower to overcome it. So the next time you find yourself guiltily experiencing immoral temptations, relax. It might even earn you some extra praise from your adult friends, so long as you do the right thing in the end. Your children, on the other hand, will be judging you quite harshly! This article appears courtesy of Aeon Magazine.  "
From Diversity to Desk Chairs: This Week’s Top 7 Education Stories,Atlantic,Hayley Glatter,2017-01-06,"A School Championing Diversity in a Town That Resists It, Steve Kolowich | Chronicle of Higher Education,  The majority of the Somali students at St. Cloud State [in Minnesota] had spent most of their lives in America.   …     They are part of a generation of refugees who are trying to do what immigrants in the United States have done for years: get educated, expand their horizons, and build better lives for themselves while also staying connected to the culture that sustained their elders through the traumas of war and dislocation. For the younger Somalis, a college degree represents a chance to avoid the powerlessness of life in the   working class. What it might not offer them is a privilege afforded to many Americans regardless of education: the freedom to speak for themselves, and no one else. * * * The Grassroots Movement to Get Black Men to the Front of the Classroom  Kristen Graham | The Philadelphia Inquirer,  Black male teachers in Philadelphia would reach out to [Sharif  ] periodically, asking to talk about the often lonely spot in which they found themselves.   didn’t go out looking for peers —  they all gravitated toward one another. The dinners at 48th Street Grille began —  talks about how to get beyond being pigeonholed as disciplinarians, about what it’s like to be constantly called upon to be experts on black culture or diversity, about how to bring their experiences to the table without being viewed as “hardheaded and uncoachable,” as   said. Eventually, the group formalized its work into the fellowship, now a nonprofit with 50 paid members. * * * The Empathy of John King  Melissa   | Elle,  “Just think about that scene [in It’s a Wonderful Life],” Secretary King told me as we sat in his office at the Department of Education. “If you are 22 years old and just out of college, you may not have the perspective that if you are calling a parent at 7 p. m. you are not calling a blank slate. ” That parent is like George Bailey, King says, living his own life, filled with challenges. “If the parent just got an eviction notice, it is not going to be a very productive   conference!” Using this unexpected film as an object lesson in empathy perfectly captures our current secretary of education. He is an unapologetic nerd. Spend more than a few hours with him and you will likely hear some version of his  : “I was a teacher, I’m the son of teachers, and teachers saved my life. ” You’ll hear King say this, not because it is a practiced mantra, but because it is the truth of who he is. * * *  Replacing the Antiquated Desk Chair  Megan Raposa | Argus Leader,  Students in Sheremy Haas’s classroom don’t work in rows of desks with chairs. Many don’t sit in chairs at all. The   Harvey Dunn Elementary School teacher encourages choice in where her students sit. Some find cushions on the floor. Others sit on yoga balls or wobble chairs, hard plastic stools shaped like empty spools of thread that tip gently side to side and require both feet to stay firmly planted on the ground. * * * The Most Unequal Schools on Earth, The Economist, [In South Africa] the gap in test scores between the top 20 percent of schools and the rest is wider than in almost every other country. Of 200 black pupils who start school, just one can expect to do well enough to study engineering. Ten white kids can expect the same result. Many of the problems have their roots in apartheid. * * * How Design Thinking Became a Buzzword at School, Jessica Lahey | The Atlantic, At a recent teaching conference in Richmond, Virginia, a session on “design thinking” in education drew a capacity crowd.   …     Many of the teachers in attendance were flummoxed, however. As we filed out of the room and headed toward our next sessions, I overheard one woman remark to another that while the   project looked like something she’d like to try in her own classroom, “I think I missed something. I still don’t understand what design thinking is. Do you?” The other teacher shook her head and said, “I think it’s a curriculum, but I’m not really sure. ” * * *   on Their Heart Conditions, Tori McElhaney | The Red and Black, Having one athlete with a heart condition is uncommon. Having two athletes with heart conditions on the same team is almost unheard of, and that is where we find Georgia. Junior forward Mackenzie Engram and freshman forward Kortney Eisenman have both battled through various heart conditions in the past year. The heart conditions have left one, after months of recovery, finally able to come back to the game she loves this season, and the other with the prognosis of never playing basketball again. "
Putin and the Populists,Atlantic,Ronald Brownstein,2017-01-06,"Donald Trump is practically alone in mainstream American politics in his consistent praise of Vladimir Putin and insistence that the United States would benefit from warmer relations with Russia. But that inclination to view Putin more as ally than adversary places Trump squarely in line with the racially infused,   movements gaining ground in both America and Europe. And that means the   friction over Russia between Trump and more traditional   thinkers like Senators John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina points toward a much larger debate over the priorities that should drive American foreign policy. The Key to Putin’s Cyber Power, Across the political spectrum, mainstream   thinkers in both the United States and Europe view Putin as a threat largely because he is pushing to expand Russian influence across eastern Europe and the Middle East in ways that could destabilize the U. S.  system of alliances and global rules that has defined the international order since World War II. That concern has spiked amid a succession of provocative actions from Putin, ranging from his 2014 incursion into Ukraine and brutal military campaign against   rebels in Syria, to the U. S. intelligence community’s conclusion that Russia hacked Democratic Party email accounts to influence the 2016 American presidential election. (Trump, due to receive an intelligence briefing about those conclusions on Friday, has steadfastly resisted and belittled that conclusion.) But the   nationalists in both the United States and Europe view Putin as a potential ally because they are focused on a sharply contrasting set of international priorities: resisting Islamic radicalization, unwinding global economic integration, and fighting the secularization of Western societies. Top Trump advisers like incoming White House chief strategist Stephen Bannon and National Security Adviser Michael Flynn have expressed strikingly similar views. In that way, the clashing perspectives on Putin reflect not only differences on how to relate specifically to Russia, but on what goals should guide American foreign policy in the 21st century, and what allies are necessary to advance those aims. On both sides of the Atlantic, the push to reset with Putin reflects a desire to elevate a different set of   concerns while downplaying, or even abandoning, the alliances that have bound European nations more tightly to each other, and to the United States, for decades. One critical variable of the Trump presidency may be how far this radical shift in perspective advances in a Republican Party where most elected officials and   analysts still believe global stability depends on an   network of rules and alliances, and still view Putin as an escalating threat to that order. Though the   embrace of Putin common in Europe remains confined to the GOP’s margins, it appears to be establishing a beachhead under Trump, noted Richard Fontaine, president of the centrist Center for a New American Security, and the former top   aide to McCain. “It’s already going further than I expected it to go,” Fontaine said in an interview. “The fact that     Republicans are going out and suggesting we don’t know who hacked what [in the 2016 campaign] and the sanctions may be an overreaction is not a terribly encouraging sign. ” The major conservative nationalist and populist movements in Europe, including France’s National Front, Britain’s U. K. Independence Party, Germany’s Alternative for Germany, the Netherlands’s Party for Freedom, Austria’s Freedom Party, and Hungary’s Jobbik, don’t completely overlap in their views of Putin. Geert Wilders, the leader of the Party for Freedom, for instance, has been cooler toward Putin than the National Front’s Marine Le Pen, who borrowed from a Russian bank to help fund the party’s 2014 electoral campaign, or the Freedom Party, which recently signed a “cooperation agreement” with Putin’s United Russia party. But the European populist parties share a common set of priorities focused on restricting immigration, unwinding global economic and political integration (by renouncing the European Union, and, for some of these parties, NATO as well) taking tougher steps to fight Islamic radicalism, and, in most cases, opposing cultural liberalism and secularization at home. On all those fronts, they view Putin not as a threat, but as an ally. “It’s certainly not that they follow him the way Communist parties used to follow the Soviet Union. That’s a misrepresentation,” said Cas Mudde, a University of Georgia associate professor of international affairs who studies these movements. “But   …     they do like his strength, what they perceive as defense for strong traditional values, nationalism, and opposition to Islam. ” On each of those concerns, Putin has positioned himself as a bulwark of conservative values. First in Chechnya and more recently in Syria, he can claim to have taken the fight to Islamic extremists, perhaps more aggressively than any Western nation since America overthrew the Taliban in Afghanistan (of course, Russia’s Syria campaign has focused far less on combating the Islamic State than on obliterating opponents of President Bashar  ’s regime). Conservative populists like Le Pen have hailed Putin’s hostility toward global institutions as a model for prioritizing nationalist independence over multilateral cooperation and integration. “The model that is defended by Vladimir Putin is radically different to that of Mr. Obama,” Le Pen told a British television interviewer last November. “As for me, the model that is defended by Vladimir Putin, which is one of reasoned protectionism, looking after the interests of his own country, defending his identity, is one that I like, as long as I can defend this model in my own country. ” Particularly since his return to the Russian presidency in 2012, Putin has portrayed himself as a defender of traditional social values, especially in opposition to gay rights, and as a religiously devout alternative to Western countries that he has said “are denying moral principles and all traditional identities: national, cultural, religious, and even sexual. ” While the idea of Putin lecturing the world on “moral principles” grates on mainstream ears, that stance has also drawn praise, not only from conservative populists in Europe, but also   American activists, like columnist Patrick J. Buchanan, whose 1996 bid for the GOP presidential nomination presaged many of Trump’s insular themes. Against these shared priorities, the European populist parties almost universally downplay Putin’s destabilizing moves, including those in Ukraine and the annexation of Crimea, as, at most, a   concern. Nigel Farage, a founder of the U. K. Independence Party and the European populist leader personally closest to Trump, has said that while Putin’s incursion in Ukraine was not justified, it was an understandable response to Western overreach. “The Ukrainian crisis actually was sparked by the European Union saying they wanted to extend their borders to take in the Ukraine, which Putin took as being a direct threat,” Farage told Fox News last summer. “Now, my view on Putin and the Russians is, don’t poke the Russian bear with a stick. If you do, you’re bound to get a response. ” Farage’s take is common among Europe’s conservative populists. “They don’t think that Russia wants to reinstate a Soviet Union. They consider Russia pretty much defending itself against globalism, and they would like to have the EU or NATO out of central and eastern Europe,” Mudde said. “But they don’t assume that Russia then moves back in. Russia is of no concern to them. They don’t believe Russia has ambitions to threaten western Europe. ” To a striking extent, top Trump advisers Flynn and especially Bannon have expressed similar views in recent years. In an extensive 2014 speech at the Vatican unearthed by Buzzfeed, Bannon echoed common arguments from the European nationalist parties to explain why people he called “traditionalists” were drawn to Putin. Bannon portrayed Putin as championing both nationalism and conservative cultural values. “One of the reasons [Putin is attractive to ‘traditionalists’] is that they believe that at least Putin is standing up for traditional institutions, and he’s trying to do it in a form of nationalism —  and I think that people, particularly in certain countries, want to see the sovereignty for their country, they want to see nationalism for their country,” Bannon said. “They don’t believe in this kind of   Union or they don’t believe in the centralized government in the United States. ” Later, Bannon added: “Putin’s been quite an interesting character. He’s also very, very, very intelligent. I can see this in the United States where he’s playing very strongly to social conservatives about his message about more traditional values. ” To a greater extent than the European populists, Bannon was careful to also criticize the Russian leader, saying “Putin and his cronies [are] a kleptocracy, that are really an imperialist power that want to expand. ” But like Europe’s   populists, Bannon immediately argued that the potential threat Putin posed ranked below more pressing concerns, like allying with the Russian leader against Islamic terrorism. “I really believe that in this current environment, where you’re facing a potential new caliphate that is very aggressive that is really a situation —   I’m not saying we can put it on a back burner —  but I think we have to deal with first things first. ” Flynn, former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, similarly suggested sublimating American concerns about Russian behavior to the struggle against Islamic terror during his controversial visit to Moscow in December 2015. “I am speaking as [a] private citizen, but the U. S. can’t sit there and go: ‘Russia, you’re bad’ Russia can’t sit there and be ‘U. S. you’re bad! ’” Flynn said in an interview on RT, Russia’s     television network. “I think that we have to step back and we have to say: ‘Okay, what are the common interests, and what are the common goals that we want to achieve’ —  and   …     I believe, the number one goal is to eliminate this cancerous idea that exists inside the Islamic religion. ” Expanding the argument, Flynn suggested that the new threat of global terror required a fundamental shift in priorities that would position the United States and Russia less as competitors than as collaborators in a common fight. “[W]e have to begin to understand that this is not an   world, folks, [that it’s] actually more of a   world, and we have to decide —  U. S. Europe, Russia and other, other countries, countries in South America, maybe, and even China and India, how do we want the world to be over the course of the next 10 years, 25 years, 50 years?” Flynn added. “[I] don’t believe for a second that we’re going to defeat the Islamic State in two years. This has been described as a   War. ” How many of these views Trump personally shares is unclear. He has said strikingly little about why he believes better relations with Putin would advantage the United States, other than to broadly suggest the two nations could work together more effectively against ISIS. Many analysts see Trump’s attraction to Putin as mostly a personal connection driven both by Trump’s admiration for his   style, and Putin’s careful flattery of the  . But Fontaine, the former McCain aide and CNAS president, said a tilt toward Putin would be compatible with two larger   tendencies Trump has hinted at. One is an inclination to view “China as the bigger threat” to the United States both because of its aggressive posture in Asia and because it represents a much more formidable economic competitor than Russia. Second, Fontaine noted, Trump at various points has suggested —  particularly in his comments about Asia —  that he is more comfortable trying to maintain global stability through regional “spheres of influence” led by locally dominant powers than through “one unified world order in which American power is the ultimate foundation. ” Through that lens, Fontaine continued, Russia’s attempts to expand its reach in eastern Europe “may not be as concerning to you than if you are concerned that it is undermining the   system of the world. ” So far, Fontaine said, this more benign assessment of Putin has very little support among elected officials in either party. “Almost everybody thinks if we can find some way to work with Russia on discrete issues, [then] sure [let’s pursue those opportunities],” he said. “But that there is no overarching deal, or friendly bond between the U. S. and this Russia that can be had either without compromising fundamental interests or principles, or seeing the agreement go up in smoke when Russia violates it. ” McCain offered the rallying cry for that competing view in his bristling opening statement at Thursday’s Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on Russian hacking and other cyber threats. “It should not surprise us that Vladimir Putin would think he could launch increasingly severe cyberattacks against our nation,” McCain insisted, “when he has paid little price for invading Ukraine, annexing Crimea, subverting democratic values and institutions across Europe, and of course, helping Bashar [ ]Assad slaughter civilians in Syria for more than a year with impunity. ” And yet both in America and in Europe, electoral momentum has been growing for the   and populist movements arguing for a fundamental reassessment of global alliances that would include a reset of relations with Russia. The depth of Putin’s commitments to these movements is likely shallow: As Mudde noted, Russia has touted   parties in Europe as well when that suits its interests. But Putin has also clearly demonstrated that he views the rise of conservative nationalism as an ally of convenience in a goal that suddenly seems more obtainable than at any time in decades: loosening the Western alliance from both its American and European moorings. “I don’t think we should underestimate the degree to which the undermining of the fabric of Western society is a fundamental aim of what Putin is all about,” said Ivo Daalder, President Obama’s former permanent representative to NATO and now president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs. “We are in a very different time period that has far more to do with the 1920s and 1930s than it does with 2010. We are at a tipping point where the success of these [populist] movements raises fundamental question about the [viability of the] international order we are living in. ” Atlantic assistant editor Leah Askarinam contributed."
What Donald Trump Owes Wall Street,Atlantic,Conor Friedersdorf,2017-01-06,"Wells Fargo. JPMorgan Chase. Fidelity Investments. Prudential PLC. Vanguard Group. These are among the major financial institutions that own business debt held by Donald Trump, according to an investigation just published by the Wall Street Journal. While the  ’s finances remain murky, due largely to his refusal to release his tax returns, the newspaper reports that he owes at least hundreds of millions of dollars, that the debt is held by more than 150 institutions, and that some of it is backed by his personal guarantee. “As a result, a broader array of financial institutions now are in a potentially powerful position over the incoming president,” it states. “If the Trump businesses were to default on their debts, the giant financial institutions that serve as   special servicers of these loan pools would have the power to foreclose on some of Mr. Trump’s marquee properties or seek the tens of millions of dollars that Mr. Trump personally guaranteed on the loans. ” One wonders whether to be more worried about Big Finance using its leverage to influence the president or the president abusing his power in order to thwart his creditors. Either way, Trump’s decision to hold on to his opaque business empire while president, rather than liquidating his interests to focus on the good of the country, has created unprecedented conflicts of interest that even a saint would have difficulty navigating in office. In a prior column, I noted a New York Times investigation into a portion of Trump’s business dealings in foreign countries, arguing that in India, China, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Brazil, Argentina, and other countries besides, there will be countless occasions where the interests of the United States and the interests of the Trump organization diverge. If the Times story was the best look we’ve gotten at specific conflicts of interest abroad, the Wall Street Journal article is the domestic analog, highlighting facts like this: Wells Fargo  Co. for example, runs at least five mutual funds that own portions of Trump businesses’ securitized debt, according to an analysis of   data conducted by Morningstar Inc. for the Journal. The bank also is a trustee or administrator for pools of securitized loans that include $282 million of loans to Mr. Trump. And Wells acts as a special servicer for $950 million of loans to a property that one of Mr. Trump’s companies partly owns, according to securities and property filings. Wells Fargo is currently facing scrutiny from federal regulators surrounding its fraudulent sales practices and other issues. Once he takes office, Mr. Trump will appoint the heads of many of the regulators that police the bank. The article lists other specific conflicts. And then there’s this alarming detail: “It is impossible to identify all the firms or individuals that now hold Trump businesses’ securitized debt, as these investments often don’t have to be disclosed. ” As a result, it is easy to imagine Trump covertly benefitting or punishing one of his debtors (depending on his analysis of what’s preferable). He needn’t be in a position to directly appoint regulators to do so. He often posts tweets that laud or vilify corporations with huge consequences for their stockholders. How many corporate leaders would quietly forgive debt if the stock of their biggest competitor would be tanked, rather than their own? This should concern even Americans who voted for Donald Trump. The underlying case here isn’t that he is unusually corrupt, but that the extreme power of the presidency requires a responsible country to put anyone who rises to the position under a microscope. Trump’s unusually big business conflicts create even more problems than usual, temptations to which the vast majority of humans might succumb. If Trump merely behaves as most people would, the country will lose, bigly. Tens of millions of people will be harmed. Trump is nevertheless offering less transparency than any predecessor in the modern era, and entering office with both houses of Congress controlled by Republicans who show no inclination to fulfill their responsibility to scrutinize his conflicts. Until members of Congress launch a full probe into Trump’s financial assets and debts, so that at the very least they can understand where his interests and America’s interests diverge, there is no way that they can adequately represent their constituents. And it is particularly ironic that their historic abdication of responsibility is rooted in partisanship, given that it will benefit a man with no loyalty to the Republican Party."
The Desire to Live-Stream Violence,Atlantic,J. Weston Phippen,2017-01-06,"   Two men and two women in Chicago were arrested and charged Thursday with kidnapping and torturing a man, slicing off a piece of his hair, down to his scalp, with a knife. Many people were witness to the assault, because it was streamed on Facebook Live. Jordan Hill, Tesfaye Cooper, Brittany Covington, all 18, and Tanishia Covington, who is 24 (police had earlier said she was 18, as well) have each been charged with felony aggravated kidnapping, unlawful restraint, and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon. And because the suspects are all black, the victim white, and because video of the assault shows the suspects yelling, “fuck Donald Trump,” and “fuck white people,” the four have also been charged with a hate crime. Police said one of the suspects knew the victim, who is 18, from high school. The victim had been reported missing Monday by his family, and is said to have   problems. He was taken in a stolen van from where his family had dropped him off to meet a friend how he ended up with the suspects is still being investigated. In the video, the man sits in the corner of the room, bound, and with tape over his mouth. The suspects cut the sleeves of his sweatshirt, kick and hit him, and threaten his life. It’s a crime Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson called “sickening. ” He said it displayed the “brazenness of the offenders who assaulted the victim and then broadcast it for the entire world to see. ” Which raises the question: Why would someone   a crime? “There’s an easy answer,” N. G. Berrill, executive director of the the New York Center for Neuropsychology  Forensic Behavioral Science, told me, “which is that they’re stupid. ” Most of the approximately   video focuses on a woman who is apparently holding a cellphone and filming the assault. She blows smoke into the camera, flashes a few bottles of alcohol, even checks her hair. The three others in the   pop in and out and talk to the camera. At one point, dissatisfied with how few people have tuned in to watch the group assault the man, the woman with the cellphone says to her internet following, “You all ain’t even commenting on my shit. Ain’t nobody watching my shit. ” A bit later, presumably after someone commented on her   she says, “What up, Devin? ”During all this, the bound victim can be heard pleading  . Stupidity may be one answer for the suspects’ actions. But the group also seems oblivious of their actions and callous to the victim’s suffering. Berrill said part of the reason they might have   the assault can be chalked up to teen impulsiveness. “Obviously, there’s not a lot of   thought here,” he said. The more difficult answer, however, cuts close to a recent internet phenomenon that includes cases like Marina Lonina, the Ohio woman who filmed her underage friend being raped last year on Periscope, another   application. Lonina and her friend, who was 17, went home with    Raymond Boyd Gates, who was convicted last October of rape. Lonina told police later she intended to recorded the assault so Gates would stop, but, in the words of the prosecutor, “she got caught up in it by the number of likes that her   was getting, so she continued to do it.” Violence will always attract attention. And in the Chicago video clip, the four teenagers boast about their intentions to harm the man, almost feeding and building upon each other’s claims, until one man tells viewers they plan to stick the victim in the trunk of a car, put a brick on the gas pedal, then let it, “errrrrrrr   …     . ” “It speaks to a kind of scary place in the culture where people are willing to expose their misled ideas, their sadism, their sexual perversion, their felonious behavior, for the accolades they’ll receive through social media,” Berrill said. Police would later find the victim disoriented, wandering the streets on Chicago’s West Side, an area that experienced heavy violence this past year, as has much of the city. This context is also important in understanding what happened: Last year the city had 762 homicides, a nearly 60 percent increase from the previous year. In certain neighborhoods, violence is normal. Young kids, especially teenagers, can become desensitized to what may seem to the rest of the country as merely one horrific moment. “It is a perfect example of chaos,” Desmond Patton, an assistant professor of social work at Columbia University, and who studied at the University of Chicago, told me. “Number one they are young people, and young people have forever made dumb decisions and mistakes. But when this is embedded in an environment of violence, where violence is unaddressed, and in deprived communities, then these are the types of things that can happen. ” The world in which some of the young men and women live can be horrifying, Patton said, and the   is partly a reflection of that. What may seem appalling and evil to the wider world, may not be too far beyond normal for some of these people —  it’s just not typically broadcast for everyone to see. Many of the people Berrill studies in cases like this are   or   and, like a child repeatedly dropping a toy on the ground, they have trouble differentiating good and bad attention. This will probably get worse, Berrill said. Facebook’s   application is relatively new. It has been used to record the mundane, the exceptionally heroic, the horrific, and in this case the sadistic. In that way, it is a reflection of society. But what’s new, Berrill said, is he wonders if this attack would have even happened if the assailants could not have broadcast it. “It’s an element in these cases that encourages this behavior, because they know immediately there’s a built in audience for it,” he said. As people develop online communities and audiences, there will always be a desire to attract more attention —  whether that’s through Twitter, or  . And a shortcut to attract attention will always be to say or do something absurd, contentious, even violent."
Is NASA Paving the Way for Asteroid Mining?,Atlantic,Marina Koren,2017-01-06,"In March 1852, Italian astronomer Annibale de Gasparis discovered an asteroid orbiting between Mars and Jupiter, one of several he would find in his lifetime. He named it Psyche, after the Greek word for the soul. Many decades later, the name would take on new meaning. Scientists believe Psyche, one of the largest objects in the asteroid belt, may be the exposed metal core of an early planet, the soul of a celestial body. Seven years from now, we’ll find out for sure. Earlier this week, NASA chose to fund an eponymous robotic mission to Psyche, scheduled to launch in 2023. The mission marks the first time spacecraft will visit a metallic asteroid, an extremely rare object in the solar system. Similar NASA missions have only visited rocky and icy worlds, like planets and other asteroids, like Vesta and Ceres. Scientists believe Psyche could have grown to be the size of Mars, but its rocky outer layers were smashed away by a series of collisions billions of years ago. What remains, a world made of metallic nickel and iron, is about the size of Massachusetts. “By visiting Psyche, we can literally visit a planetary core the only way that humankind ever can,” Lindy   the Psyche mission’s lead investigator, told reporters Wednesday. “It’s 1, 800 miles to the Earth’s core, and the deepest humans have ever managed to drill is     miles. ” Psyche is the only known round metal body in the solar system. The Psyche mission, led by researchers from Arizona State University, will launch in 2023 and reach its namesake by 2030. Over 20 months, the spacecraft will collect data about Psyche’s composition and topography, and, as is standard for robotic missions these days, return beautiful,   images of the asteroid. They hope Psyche will help them better understand planet formation, and learn more about Earth’s own iron core. The Psyche mission is part of NASA’s Discovery program, which funds robotic spacecraft usually focused on a specific slice of science. The missions are capped at $450 million, making them pretty inexpensive, as far as solar system trips go. But the payoffs can be big. The Kepler space telescope has discovered hundreds of exoplanets since its launch in 2009 MESSENGER mission put the first spacecraft into Mercury’s orbit in 2011 and Dawn orbited one asteroid in 2011 before zooming over toward another last year, helping scientists understand the formation of rocky and icy bodies. The Discovery announcement suggests a growing enthusiasm for asteroid research. NASA has also approved funding for the Lucy mission, which will launch in 2021 to explore the Trojan asteroids, so called because they’re named after figures in the mythical war, that share the orbit Jupiter takes around the sun. The choices add to a potentially   news cycle for the 2020s. NASA this week announced it would fund for another year the Near Earth Object Camera project, which would launch an infrared telescope into space track potentially dangerous asteroids near Earth in 2021. The space agency is also working on the Asteroid Redirect Mission, an ambitious plan to redirect an asteroid into a stable orbit around the moon, where astronauts will visit it and come back with samples in the 2020s. But this mission is perhaps the unluckiest of them all. The project is costing NASA more than $1 billion, and has found little to tepid support within the scientific and lawmaking community —  and the next administration. Looking beyond the 2020s, NASA’s asteroid kick is especially exciting for supporters of asteroid mining. The development of such technology is still very much in its infancy, but it’s underway. Planetary Resources, a    startup based in Washington State, has been collecting investors for an   satellite, with plans to someday mine the objects. Last summer, the government of Luxembourg announced it would create a fund of more than $227 million for investment in   companies. Planetary Resources received  nearly $27 million of that in November. Little is known about the composition and other properties of the Trojan asteroids near Jupiter. But the resources on   Psyche could be worth billions or even trillions of dollars —  once humans finish developing the technology to mine them, of course."
Can States Make People Pay Even When Their Convictions Are Overturned?,Atlantic,Garrett Epps,2017-01-06,"A decade or so ago, I asked students in an     seminar to write an essay on the following topic: Can we, as lawyers, live “good lives” (in the philosophical sense) when we earn our daily bread from a system devoted to controlling, confining, punishing, and even killing others with scant regard for their individuality or even their guilt or innocence? The answer my students uniformly gave was yes. The system, they said, was livable because “we do our best” with limited funds and in the face of intractable social problems. The system sometimes fails, they said, but it strives for justice. Trump vs. the Spies, What’s interesting is that most of my students had, by that time in their studies, seen enough to know that answer is often not true. In their daily practice, lawyers continually recognize, and often exploit, the ways in which the legal system works  against the poor and the outsider, to the advantage of the rich and powerful. In the system’s    workings, justice is not a goal of which the system falls short it is, by and large, an irrelevance. Yet in their hearts, many Americans, lawyer and   alike, cling to the shining myth: Runnymede, Sir Thomas More, Atticus Finch, Gideon v. Wainwright, Archibald Cox. But every now and then, like a hologram in a   TV show, the myth flickers and fades, revealing ugly truth below the myth: an organized racket by which those on top corral and shear the sheep on the bottom, depriving them of liberty, property, and even life after a mockery of due process and by criteria so arbitrary as to be indistinguishable from whim. Consider the case the Supreme Court will hear Monday. Nelson v. Colorado poses the following question: Suppose you are arrested, charged with a serious crime, and convicted. The court sentences you to prison and orders you to pay various fees and restitution —  seemingly small amounts that are, given your economic circumstances, daunting nonetheless. Then, against the odds, you persuade a higher court that the evidence against you was insufficient or improperly admitted. Your conviction is overturned. You are free to go. Can the state keep the money it seized from you on the grounds that you’re probably guilty anyway? That in essence is the claim advanced by the state of Colorado in defense of its uniquely punitive system of criminal fines and fees. Most states have increasingly turned to forcing criminal defendants to pay the costs of their own prosecution. But only Colorado has decided it can keep defendants’ money even when their convictions are set aside. The petitioners in the case are Shannon Nelson and Louis Alonzo Madden. Nelson was convicted of five counts of sexual abuse allegedly directed at her children. A state appeals court reversed her conviction, however it said that the trial judge had allowed improper “expert” testimony that tainted the jury’s verdict. After the appeal, the state brought Nelson to trial again. That time, a jury acquitted her of all charges. Madden was convicted of attempting to patronize a child prostitute and attempted sexual assault. On appeal, a state court set aside the   conviction and affirmed the assault count then a state trial judge decided that Madden’s lawyer had been ineffective and therefore vacated the assault conviction as well. The state chose not to try Madden again. Both defendants had paid a fee to the state crime victim compensation fund, a “docket fee,” a “time payment fee,” a   fee, and other fees, as well as restitution payments to the victims of the crimes. After their cases ended, each asked for repayment of the sums they had paid. Madden got back his fees, but the court refused to repay the restitution. A different trial court told Nelson she was entitled to  nothing. A state appeals court ordered the money repaid, but the Colorado Supreme Court reversed that decision. Though many other state’ laws permit courts to order similar refunds as a kind of inherent judicial power, the Colorado court decided that the two could only obtain repayment under the terms of a 2013 statute called the Colorado “Exoneration Act. ” That statute was plainly designed to pay money to anyone wrongly convicted of crime and held for years in prison. If such a person can produce “clear and convincing evidence” that he or she was innocent, then the court can award a hefty payment —  as much as $120, 000 a year in capital cases —  for each year wrongly served. That money is not repayment it is an independent payment for the wrong done to the convicted person. But of course, Nelson and Madden weren’t seeking payment, and, more important, they hadn’t proved they were “innocent. ” They hadn’t tried to they aren’t required to under the American system. (Runnymede, Finch, Gideon —  remember? ). The state always has the burden to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, and this it had, in both cases, been unable to do. Nonetheless, the state supreme court held, the state was entitled to the money. It’s hard to see why, if you go by, you know, the law and the Constitution —  there is no legal crime for which either owed fines or restitution. Nonetheless, the court said, Nelson and Madden were out of luck unless they could prove their innocence. Nelson and Madden have one fairly compelling argument, as pithily phrased in their petition: “It is not Colorado’s money. ” That ought to appeal to the Court, coupled with the fact that the Colorado system seems to be unique. Most states charge the “fees” and order restitution, but readily refund the payments if a conviction is found invalid. Colorado’s brief to the Supreme Court is so truculent, so full of Margaret   faux outrage, that a reader might suspect the state has no case. In their first argument, the state’s lawyers rewrite the petitioners’ claim, suggesting they are grifters trying to create out of thin air a   right to an “automatic money judgment” when convictions are set aside. This is too clever by half. The petitioners aren’t seeking a payment as compensation for being convicted they just want their own money back. The state’s second argument rewrites the existing law. The brief cites venerable cases suggesting that defendants don’t necessarily get repayment of fines even after a court strikes down the statute they were convicted under. Those cases, however, might be called “Inigo Montoya cases” —  that is, they do not mean what Colorado thinks they mean. In most of them, the defendants had either (1) admitted guilt or (2) voluntarily chosen to pay a fine and plead guilty in order to avoid jail. Neither of those is true in this case the defendants have consistently pleaded not guilty, and neither agreed to the “fees” and restitution or received any leniency for paying them. The fees and restitution were part of a criminal sentence. In fact, Colorado’s main argument seems to be written between the lines. May it please the Court, their brief whispers, these two may have escaped justice on a technicality, but we all know they are guilty as hell. In its recital of the facts, the state lingers over each stage of the proceedings —  these sure were bad crimes, weren’t they? The trial court found probable cause, didn’t it? There were “forensic interviews,” weren’t there? The victims testified, didn’t they? A jury convicted them, didn’t it? Come on, it seems to be saying. We all know that if these people are so   pure, the police would never have arrested them. It’s thoroughly unappealing advocacy, and one hopes it will not sway four of the eight (if the Court deadlocks, the Colorado state court decision will stand). As I said above, Colorado is the only state with the gall to demand money from defendants whose convictions are reversed. The Court can easily reverse this grotesque decision without disruption of the system nationwide —  and we can all go back to our shining dream of justice."
America Is Still Making Things  ,Atlantic,Alana Semuels,2017-01-06,"COLUMBIA CITY, Ind. —  Big companies such as Rexnord and Carrier are closing down plants in this Rust Belt state and moving their factories to Mexico. But in some corners, including this rural patch of the state’s northeast, manufacturing is growing. In a nondescript building set among the icy cornfields of Columbia City, Brian Emerick, the CEO and owner of Micropulse, employs 306 people who make millions of dollars worth of specialized medical equipment such as orthopedic implants and the surgical tools used to install them. That’s up from the 190 he employed five years ago. “I’m bullish on manufacturing here,” he told me, as he walked me through the    facility where workers were busy running machines and inspecting tiny metal parts with giant magnifying glasses. “There’s always going to be a certain amount of jobs you can’t automate away. ” Micropulse is an example of the type of manufacturing that’s not going to disappear anytime soon from United States. It makes   products that would be difficult to make overseas because they are constantly being updated and are highly regulated. Many of these products are made by machines, but Emerick still needs workers to run and program those machines and to inspect the products once they’re completed. As some types of manufacturing disappear in America —  manual jobs that can be performed in  places like Mexico where there are lower wages, and repetitive ones that can be automated —  other types are growing.   advanced manufacturing, which is highly specialized and requires a facility with computers, is actually expanding. The U. S. economy will need to fill 3. 5 million skilled manufacturing jobs over the next decade, the White House says. This is an industry that employs skilled and educated workers such as engineers and scientists. It’s also an industry that adds significant value to the economy. Manufacturing output continues to rise in the U. S. and the average factory worker makes $180, 000 worth of goods every year, more than three times what he produced in 1978. “The mantra that we’ve lost   jobs to China is exactly wrong,” said Michael Hicks, an economics professor at Ball State University who has studied manufacturing in Indiana. “We’ve lost the   jobs to China and gained   jobs. ” Of course, the U. S. has lost 5 million manufacturing jobs since 2000, and those losses have reverberated across the country. The scale of those losses has overshadowed areas of growth —  but there has been growth. For example, the number of workers employed manufacturing medical equipment and supplies has grown eight percent over the last two decades, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, even as overall manufacturing employment has fallen 28 percent over that same time period. Indeed, manufacturing job losses have been concentrated in     jobs, said Hicks. Since 2000, jobs in manufacturing for people with graduate degrees have grown by 32 percent. While manufacturing jobs for people with less than a   education fell 44 percent between 2000 and 2013, those for people with an associate degrees in academic fields rose 17 percent, according to the Congressional Research Service. That’s because in the last decade, as manufacturing companies faced intense competition from overseas, they invested in equipment and technology that made their plants more efficient and specialized, Hicks said. That meant that thousands of jobs were automated, but also that new jobs were created for people who worked with machines in the manufacturing process. This increased specialization is exactly what economic theory predicts would happen as trade advances, Hicks said. A concept known as comparative advantage suggests that countries should use their assets to specialize —  to make what they make best. Because of comparatively low costs of labor in countries such as China and Mexico, those countries specialize in making the kinds of goods that require a lot of labor but not as much technology and skill. For the United States, the result is the opposite: Its advantage is the kind of     manufacturing that capitalizes on the country’s technology and educated labor pool. “Our comparative advantage would be towards more sophisticated production,” Hicks said. This is a key point often missed in the debate over whether it’s trade or automation that has displaced American jobs. Automation and trade are deeply entwined phenomena trade increases pressures to automate or export simple jobs, but also incentivizes the U. S. to specialize and create more   jobs. In some ways, the whole narrative that manufacturing is disappearing is flawed, Hicks says. Manufacturing, like most other industries in America, has modernized and become more sophisticated over the decades. To be sure, it employs millions fewer people than it did in the past. But manufacturing still makes up about 12. 5 percent of America’s gross domestic product, the same as it did in 1960. People who can work in modern manufacturing —  those with computer skills and advanced degrees —  are in demand. The average manufacturing worker now makes $26 an hour, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The catch is that traditional manufacturing workers don’t have those advanced degrees, and can’t get those jobs. “Maybe the problem isn’t so much the industry job losses, but that the men and women in manufacturing had much poorer educational attainment, and had been in less technically dynamic workplaces, Hicks told me. “ So, when the world changed, they could not. ” Half a century ago, almost no manufacturing workers went to college they graduated from high school and went straight to the factory, where they could find a good job for life. Now, it’s becoming more and more common for manufacturers to hire workers who have some higher education. Nearly 20 percent of the manufacturing workforce had a bachelor’s degree in 2012, up from 16 percent in 2000. Just 10 percent had less than a   education, down from 14 percent in 2000. Nearly 9 percent of the manufacturing workforce has a graduate or professional degree.    Advanced manufacturing presents a glimmer of hope for Rust Belt states such as Indiana, which lost huge numbers of jobs over the last two decades, creating a class of people with few prospects. Manufacturing employment in Indiana fell by 35 percent, from 671, 000 in 2000, to 439, 000 in 2010. Yet Indiana has the highest share of advanced manufacturing in the country, according to a study from Ball State University, with 53 percent of manufacturing jobs in the state in advanced manufacturing. There are now 516, 200 people working in manufacturing in Indiana. Examples of advanced manufacturers in Indiana include Rolls Royce, which makes jet engines and employs thousands of engineers in Indianapolis Cook Medical, which makes medical devices in an old RCA television plant in Bloomington and Zimmer Biomet, which makes surgical products in Warsaw, Indiana, which is a national hub for orthopedic devices. “In a   environment like Indiana, competing on lowest cost is simply not going to be effective,” Mohan Tatikonda, a professor at Indiana University’s Kelley School of Business, told me. “What can be done in   environments is making products that are more innovative, more customized to customer requirements. ” Emerick says there are a few reasons why his clients, which are orthopedic   companies, choose to have their products made in Indiana by Micropulse, rather than overseas. In order to finalize the devices’ design, there’s a lot of communication back and forth between the companies and Emerick’s engineers. Doing such discussion in multiple languages and over a   time difference would be challenging, he said. What’s more, since the devices are used in surgery, or inserted into patients’ bodies, they are subject to a high degree of regulation. Micropulse has frequent inspections by the FDA and other regulatory bodies, and such inspections would be difficult to conduct overseas. “We’re not known for low prices, but we provide the highest value in terms of reliability and ease of doing business,” Emerick said. “Our products are low volume, but they’re pretty tough to make and the materials have to be certified and traceable. ” I also stopped by an Indianapolis manufacturing facility operated by the pharmaceutical maker Eli Lilly, where the company makes pills, capsules, and devices such as injection pens for insulin users. The factory is highly automated —  I saw few people as Darin Moody, Eli Lilly’s senior vice president for global dry product and API manufacturing, gave me a tour. Moody showed me a   unit, which is essentially a series of highly automated machines that can make pharmaceuticals around the clock, assessing ingredient volumes and production independently. Yet even continuous manufacturing needs some human input: There was a group of workers in what’s called the control room, where technicians were preparing programs on computers to run a test of a placebo. “One of the things we’ve learned is that the more complex and the more automated your facilities are, the more dependent you are on having people who understand how those very complex facilities operate,” Moody said. Though some of the workers in the control room had just a   degree, most had more education, such as a bachelor’s degree in chemistry. One of the reasons Lilly has kept so much manufacturing in Indiana is because the company has close relationships with local colleges and universities, who serve as a pipeline for these educated workers. About half of the 3, 000 workers at the Indianapolis facility have bachelor’s degrees or higher. “We’re heavily dependent on engineers and scientists,” Moody said. And as I’ve written before, people who work in manufacturing and lose their jobs to trade or automation often don’t seek retraining, even though there are resources available to them. Timothy Slaper, the director of economic analysis at Indiana University’s Business Research Center, studied what happened to nearly 200, 000 people making transportation equipment and primary metals in Indiana between 2003 and 2014. He found that while, over that time period,   of the workers were still in their respective manufacturing industries, 44 percent had no payroll record at all by 2014. Only about 3 percent of these workers graduated from a public college or university in Indiana during that time period. “Very few went back to school, and relatively few seemed to avail themselves of a lot of the government programs available,” Slaper told me. Still, a new generation of workers may be more likely to seek out the education required for these advanced manufacturing jobs. Cole Love, 22, loves working with his hands, and wanted to work in manufacturing after seeing his father’s job at an orthopedic company. Love, who has a   degree in   technology, recently started working a Micropulse, where he operates a Swiss lathe making instruments that doctors use in surgery. Though Love only makes $14 an hour now, he is planning to go back to school and get a bachelor’s degree so he can work his way up at Micropulse. “I figure there’s always going to be people to program and set up the machines,” he said. The companies that employ people like Love are going to have to keep changing, too. Manufacturers who aren’t constantly innovating and doing things that their overseas competitors can’t will be left behind. Emerick, for instance, started the company out of his garage in 1988 it was a    company making instruments for all sorts of industries. But in the late 1990s and early 2000s, many of his customers, including United Technologies, the parent company of Carrier, moved operations overseas, and he lost business. The company was barely surviving when Emerick decided to auction off equipment and specialize in making tools and parts for medical companies. Micropulse now generates $40 million in sales annually. “The key is focus,” he said. “It’s about getting good at what you do, then doing more of it, so you’re recognized by your customers as being the expert. ” Specialization worked at Micropulse, and it could work, too, for others who want to continue to be employed in manufacturing. Unskilled jobs in the industry have been disappearing for decades as technology and globalization have made them obsolete. Yet technology is also enabling new types of jobs that provide a career for people who know how to use it. The hard part is what happens to everyone else. "
The Value of Fighting Attacks on Free Speech Early and Often,Atlantic,Conor Friedersdorf,2017-01-06,"Professor Keith Humphreys of Stanford University does not believe that speech is threatened on America’s campuses. He’s never perceived a meaningful threat himself. And he is very antagonistic toward several of us who believe that important values and vulnerable people will suffer unless more is done to protect free expression. His posture is not unusual. Across issues and ideologies, on matters big and small, harms that disproportionately affect a vulnerable group or class of people attract skeptics who feel impelled to minimize the importance of documented injustices, especially when they manifest in what appear to be atypical circumstances. A skeptic may grant that there are bad apples in police departments, hate crimes perpetrated against Muslims, abusive teachers who exploit union job protections, or men who catcall women on the street. But perhaps they’ve never been affected, or known anyone who has suffered the relevant harm, so they are predisposed to concluding that the problem isn’t really that bad. Baffled by those who think otherwise, they come to regard them as discreditable agitators. This type of skeptic is a scourge of civil libertarians. Though they may value the same goods in the abstract, they have a bankrupt understanding of how civil rights, liberties, and key norms must be defended in the particular if they are to endure. Last year, while reviewing the case that free speech rights and norms are threatened from the top down and the bottom up on college campuses, I detailed evidence as varied as official codes of conduct that explicitly restrict speech at scores of campuses a lobbying campaign to ban some criticism of Israel at the University of California many efforts to disinvite speakers from colleges a government program that sent undercover cops to spy on Muslim college students an administrative action at UCLA that brazenly violated the First Amendment student activists at numerous institutions formally demanding that speech be punished and widespread attempts to restrict the content of college newspapers. The rundown was highly incomplete, but I thought it sufficient to make the case. Humphreys was so unpersuaded by “The Glaring Evidence That Free Speech Is Threatened on Campus” that he cited it this week in a contemptuously dismissive rebuttal posted at Reality Based Community and The Washington Monthly. He began with an anecdote. On a brisk autumn evening at Stanford University, he chanced upon two acquaintances, a retired Eastern European diplomat and a female graduate student. Humphreys shook hands with the diplomat, who was wearing leather gloves, then introduced the diplomat to the grad student. The diplomat removed his gloves to shake her hand —  and the graduate student did not take offense that he did so. “After he departed, I said I had never seen a man take off a glove before shaking a woman’s hand and asked the student if she had or if she knew whence the custom came,” Humphreys wrote. “She smiled and responded ‘I really don’t know maybe they do that where he’s from. But he’s a sweet old man and I could tell it was his way of being gallant. ’” For Humphreys, that anecdote is a useful corrective. “If you have been reading Conor Friedersdorf’s or Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt’s writings about campus culture in The Atlantic,” he wrote, you’d have thought that “the women recoiled from the gendered   and lambasted the diplomat. ” But the encounter as it really unfolded represents “what I have seen over and over again from students for decades,” he wrote. “A spirit of common humanity and a tolerance for different ways of acting and thinking. People come to my university from all countries and all backgrounds with a huge range of beliefs and customs. Yet I have never (and I do mean never) witnessed anything on campus suggesting that the atmosphere of widespread intolerance, suspicion and emotional fragility that I keep reading about in The Atlantic actually exists. ” Sure, he added, “some students now and then have goofy ideas or act in rude ways,” but he recalls that “being just as much the case when I was a student 30 years ago. ”(For what it’s worth, free speech on campus was certainly threatened then, too.) He concluded with paragraphs that treat the distinct questions of whether speech is threatened and whether today’s students are awful as though they are the same: I have asked many colleagues and students at my university and at other universities this   question “Have you read how students today are coddled, intolerant, whiny,   prigs and do you yourself have any experience at all of this? ”Everyone has answered yes to the first part of the question and all but a handful have answered no to the second. I thus remain dubious that the heavily recycled grab bag of anecdotes I keep hearing from Conor Friedersdorf and company establish that universities have suddenly become   of epistemic closure, Maoist impulses and mattress wallpaper. Repeating dramatic anecdotes does not make them more representative of the experiences of the over 15 million students at our country’s over 4, 500 colleges and universities. Humphreys did not quote any of my actual work in his article, or when he queried his colleagues. Had he done so, he might have realized that I think more highly of their cohort than he led readers to believe, that I believe the most alarming “ ” transgressions against free speech to be the work of a small minority of students, and that even when writing about the most egregiously illiberal student  behavior, I include passages like this one, written about events last year at Yale: The purpose of writing about their missteps now is not to condemn these students. Their young lives are tremendously impressive by any reasonable measure. They are unfortunate to live in an era in which the normal mistakes of youth are unusually visible. To keep the focus where it belongs I won’t be naming any of them here. The focus belongs on the flawed ideas that they’ve absorbed. Everyone invested in how the elites of tomorrow are being acculturated should understand, as best they can, how so many cognitively privileged, ordinarily kind, seemingly   young people could lash out with such flagrant intolerance. With regard to the overall threat to speech, it is strange to be accused of trafficking only in dramatic anecdotes when my article includes an alphabetical list of institutions with written codes that infringe on speech, with links to source material. Still, the style of attack is too familiar to be surprising. Those who point to evidence of war crimes are often accused of hating the troops those who raise concerns about the difficulty of firing abusive or incompetent educators are accused of being     activists are invariably told that not all men are sexual predators, as if it is obvious that they believe otherwise reformers calling attention to unjust police killings are cast as waging “war on cops” but in every case, as in the matter of threats to campus speech, one needn’t hold any whole class in contempt to see preventable injustices or worrisome trends, or to conclude that clearer thinking or better policy would be useful. Wrongheaded behavior exists in every population, even the ones we like and root for. When I pushed back on Twitter, Humphreys expanded on his reasons for dismissing the case I made in “The Glaring Evidence That Free Speech Is Threatened on Campus. ” He noted that even if I cited 100 restrictive speech codes, that would amount to evidence of a problem at no more than 2 percent of college campuses he observed a dearth of evidence that speech is more restricted now than in the past he said he would be persuaded only if “a random sample” of campuses revealed speech codes that were “stupid and being enforced,” or a nationally representative survey showed “a rising, pervasive tide of firings, censorship, and harassment. ” Otherwise, he said, one is just “sampling the fringe and presenting it as generalizable. ” He made some good points. I would welcome the data a national survey of educational institutions would yield. And it is useful to remember that there has never been a golden age of unfettered expression in institutions of higher education, from Socrates on down, even as taboos and orthodoxies have changed. But like most attempts to insist that documented injustices in a given realm don’t rise to a level that warrants concern, his insistence on further evidence falls short. It doesn’t make much sense to wait until a civil right or settled norm is attacked so pervasively that a large portion of the population has suffered harm before defending it. I’d prefer to protect the vulnerable individuals or groups first affected —  what Humphreys calls “the fringe” —   —  and thereby preempt pervasive harm. The   rights that Americans enjoy today are ours precisely because organizations like the ACLU have spent decades “sampling the fringe” and filing lawsuits adjudicating edge cases on behalf of the victims, often precisely because they are suffering from discriminatory treatment that is atypical and unrepresentative. The Foundation for Individual Rights in Education is doing that work today. It does so in part because it understands that enforcing speech restrictions against a very few people can invisibly chill the speech of a much larger class. One or two firings may be enough to convince many professors to watch what they say no faculty waits for a wholesale purge before they begin to  . And suggesting that a hundred institutions restricting free speech still wouldn’t be sufficient evidence of a broad problem —   —  or that a randomized sample is needed before a rigorous threshold is met —   —  makes no sense in this context. Sometimes, the actions of a single university can have a broad impact all on their own. I’ve repeatedly written about threats to free speech at the University of California. It is funded by taxpayers, overseen by elected officials, and encompasses 238, 000 students. Its faculty and staff number 190, 000 and it has roughly 1. 7 million alumni. When the UC system infringes on free speech, it has enormous ramifications, even if a randomly selected sample of other colleges is doing much better. While I generally share the critique that Ivy League institutions loom too large in American life and in coverage of higher education, there is also a strong case for evincing particular concern for the health of free speech at places like Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and Brown: Their undergraduates are disproportionately propelled into positions of influence in government, business, and media they exert soft power and influence in academia their gargantuan endowments vest them with outsized clout and vital   and medical research is disproportionately undertaken on their campuses, where the strength of   norms will affect its quality. Even if   norms at America’s   system of community colleges and its many trade schools are as healthy as they’ve ever been, threats to free speech elsewhere remain important. Nor do I believe that those who care about higher education, enlightenment values, and liberal norms ought to evince concern about “stupid” speech codes in college handbooks only when they are regularly enforced. I’m as flabbergasted by the same logic when I suggest that the Espionage Act ought to be repealed, to spare us future mischief from an abusive president, only to be told, as if in defense of that law, that it has scarcely been used across the century since its passage. The speech codes of the 1990s were not regularly enforced, but that wasn’t any solace to the students who were actually punished, a disproportionate share of whom were African American. Critics like Henry Louis Gates and the courts that struck down those laws were right to challenge them, though they were seldom used. Among people who spend time or effort trying to call attention to problems, there will invariably be disagreements about the relative importance of particular injustices. Those disagreements will shape how attention and effort is parceled out, to the understandable frustration of those who feel their own priorities are given short shrift. That frustration is the price of living in a big  country filled with diverse individuals. I feel that frustration whenever I write about   concerns, only to discover that the vast majority of people feel less concern about the subject than I do. That diversity of outlook and priorities can also be a great strength. None of us is infallible or able to focus on everything that’s going wrong. As I write about my biggest concerns, I’m glad others focus on other problems. Some academic readers believe the greatest threat to speech on campus flows from the vulnerable position of adjuncts. I cheer their efforts to safeguard good teaching and scholarship. What galls me, whether the subject is police abuses or   animus or   laws, is when folks are given clear evidence of actual injustices, but dismiss their magnitude, then go a step farther, as if the right course is to treat those who are more concerned than they are as if they’re the problem. Even granting that Humphrey may have been engaging in some rhetorical hyperbole, he neither understands my actual beliefs about today’s college students nor explains why his high opinion of their virtues should allay concerns about the plurality of threats to free speech that originate with  . Addressing a gathering of undergraduates last year at Long Beach State, I urged that they reject the views of anyone who tries to stymie free expression or underestimates their strength. “You’re all smart people,” I told them. “You’re all capable of the strength that it takes to hear a wrongheaded idea, to react intellectually, even if you’re also reacting emotionally, and to formulate a logical, persuasive response. Don’t let peers, professors, or administrators convince you that you’re incapable of that. If you’re not there yet, you can get there, and it’s worth practicing. That sort of resilience will serve you well in your career, where no one is going to tiptoe around your feelings. And it is vital in civic life, because America is filled with horrific injustices. We need more people who are willing and able to look at them squarely and to persuade their fellow voters of sound responses. ” That remains my feeling about today’s college students. Whereas if I ever have a chance to address a gathering of college administrators, I’ll have much sterner stuff for their ears."
Women Know When Negotiating Isn’t Worth It,Atlantic,Olga Khazan,2017-01-06,"One of the most common explanations for the   gap is that women simply don’t ask for higher salaries, while men do. The idea that one should “always negotiate your salary” is standard   fare. In a blog post about the gender wage gap, the U. S. Department of Labor suggests women “aim higher and negotiate better” as one of the possible remedies. And at first, it seems innocuous, right? Negotiating is one of the few ways workers in today’s economy can secure better salaries and benefits. Women, the thinking goes, should do it or risk being ground up by the merciless gears of capitalism. Or, you know, make at most 93 cents to the dollar. Women do tend to negotiate less than men do, and some researchers suggest that’s because they justifiably fear they’ll violate societal norms of demure, communal female behavior —  and be punished for it. (As one study depressingly found, “Perceptions of niceness and demandingness explained resistance to female negotiators. ”) So how should women proceed? In a new paper in NBER, three economics and management researchers find that advising women to “always negotiate” might not be in their best interest —  because, it seems, women seem to already know when negotiations won’t work out in their favor. For the study, the researchers matched people in pairs, with one representing the employer and one the worker. At the start, the workers contributed either $20, $15, or $10 to a pot of money (the amount was determined by their performance on a math problem) and the firms contributed either $25 or $20. The researchers randomly assigned a “default wage” for the worker —  either $4 less than they contributed, $2 less, exactly what they contributed, or $2 more. The   teams were entered into one of two types of negotiations, all performed over instant message without revealing age, name, or gender. In the first condition, the worker could choose whether to negotiate their salary, and in the second, they had to negotiate, even if they didn’t particularly want to. Either way, they knew both parties would be penalized $5 if they failed to reach an agreement. Both genders were more likely to choose to negotiate when their “suggested wage” was $4 less than their contribution —  in other words, when they stood the most to lose from not negotiating. When they were forced to negotiate, men and women didn’t differ in their success, with both male and female workers netting a gain of about $0. 66. When given the choice, though, the female participants didn’t opt to negotiate as often as the men did. That might at first seem to support the idea that “women don’t ask” for more money or better benefits, and that’s why they don’t receive them. But the data from the “choice” condition revealed what was really going on: Women were avoiding the negotiations they knew would not end well for them. The likelihood of women losing money tripled if they were forced to negotiate, rather than given the option. “By opting out of negotiations, women are avoiding substantial financial losses,” the study authors write. “That is, women know when to ask. ” Unlike women, men were not particularly likely to opt out of negotiations that they would probably lose. Thus, being forced to negotiate was neither bad nor good for the men, but it was bad for women, says Christine Exley, an assistant professor at Harvard Business School who   the study along with Muriel Niederle of Stanford University and Lise Vesterlund at the University of Pittsburgh. We don’t know from the study why this happened. Did the men like negotiating a little too much? Were the women more psychologically attuned to the potential costs and benefits? Since the “firm” participants couldn’t discern the gender of the negotiator, the typical explanations for gender disparities, like the backlash effect or the double bind, are ruled out here. Catherine Eckel, a behavioral economist at Texas AM University who was not involved in the study, said the study suggests one reason for women’s success in negotiating in the real world could be that the ones who negotiate are the ones who are already good at it. Those who aren’t, don’t, and if they were forced to, they wouldn’t necessarily nab the same career gains. Still, women who practically never negotiate should probably not take this study as evidence they shouldn’t bother trying. In this study, the overwhelming majority of women negotiated when they were at risk of losing money. What’s more, the negotiation experiment was more transparent than a   salary discussion. As the study authors explain, they made clear what the worker risked by not negotiating, but “such a benchmark may not be available in many negotiation settings women may shy away from financially beneficial negotiations if they undervalue what they bring to the table.” Instead, Exley said the results could be a word of caution about the universal call for women to always be more aggressive in their negotiations. That school of thought suggests “all of you women who aren’t negotiating, you should negotiate, too, because we are all doing so well [in negotiations],” she says. But “the women who are choosing not to negotiate would have lost had they entered the negotiation. ” Linda Babcock, author of the popular book Women Don’t Ask, which details the “high cost of avoiding negotiation,” praised Exley’s findings as “solid. ” She said the study points to the importance of negotiation training. “Negotiation skill is not something you’re born with, but can be taught” she said. Eckel, at Texas AM, meanwhile, said it’s also worth examining other reasons for the gender wage gap, rather than blaming women for not driving a hard enough bargain. “If there are gender differences, why does that mean we have to fix the women?” she said. “Maybe we can change the situation, the rules of the game?” "
How Getting Hit by Lightning Changed a Woman’s Synesthesia,Atlantic,Sarah Zhang,2017-01-06,"By age 20, AB had suffered four concussions, gotten viral meningitis, and been struck by lightning. “She’s unofficially the unluckiest girl alive,” says Kevin Mitchell, a neurogeneticist at Trinity College Dublin, who published a recent case study on AB, a pseudonymous subject. Her series of unfortunate events also ended up producing a scientific puzzle. Because before all this, ever since she was a child, AB had been able to see colors with musical notes and perceive unique auras around people, the study reports. This mixing of senses is a   phenomenon known as synesthesia. Synesthesia can come in many different forms, including colors that evoke sounds, words that evoke tastes, or even sounds that evoke touch. For AB, each insult to her brain —  the concussions, the meningitis, the lightning —  altered her synesthesia in different ways, both subtle and dramatic. Her synesthesia eventually returns exactly the same as before it went away. No one had documented before such a case, where the perceived colors changed so much over time before returning to baseline. The brain is, weirdly enough, both malleable and unchanging. As a child, when AB saw colors with musical notes, higher pitched notes were pastel lower ones more solid. She could play by ear the tin whistle, flute, glockenspiel, marimba, and piano, perceiving    notes as the wrong color. And when she saw auras around people, their colors were determined by the people’s personalities. She associated blue with loyalty, green with caring, red with power, and so on. But in her early teens, the study explains, AB had a couple of mild concussions that led to migraines. The prescription migraine medication she took erased all the color from her synesthesia for a time. Eventually, it came back. At 19, AB got viral meningitis, an infection of the membranes around the brain. For a month thereafter, she could see colors with musical notes but they would be the wrong colors. She again recovered. But then she got another concussion, which moved the colors she saw from the center of her field of vision to the side. Yet another concussion made the colors more intense but somehow off. According to the study, it didn’t affect the actual colors she saw of objects in the real world, but the change in her synesthesia was still distressing. The colors AB perceived through synesthesia were as real to her as the colors of real objects seeing different colors with the same musical notes was like waking up one day to find apples blue. Things got really weird after she was struck by lightning two months later. This, understandably, increased her anxiety, and she started seeing strange colors like golds and silver along with colors that were possibly “not even real colors,” she told the researchers. Xanax calmed her, but it also muted the colors she perceived. Later, when she started getting seizures, medication again completely suppressed the colors. Her synesthesia returned to normal the next year, and the colors she associated with notes and people were the same as before the meningitis and lightning episodes. Drugs can sometime induce synesthesia in   so the idea that synesthesia can come and go is not surprising. “It’s almost in synesthesia folklore that synesthesia can weaken with certain types of drugs and depression,” says David Brang, a psychologist at the University of Michigan who studies synesthesia but was not involved in this case study. What’s remarkable, says Brang, is that AB’s color associations came back and remained consistent, despite all the medications and head trauma. In a second case also presented in Mitchell’s paper, a man referred to as CD lost his synesthesia for eight years when he started taking antidepressants for Seasonal Affective Disorder, only to have it return in full force when he stopped. Synesthesia has two competing —  though not mutually exclusive —  explanations in neurobiology. In one, people with synesthesia have extra connections in their brains, connecting for example their auditory cortex with their visual cortex. In the second, everyone has these connections between different parts of the brains, but they’re usually unactivated. These connections may be disinhibited —  as in   —  in people with synesthesia. The cases of AB and CD do not readily point to one explanation over the other. Perhaps the drugs and head trauma altered the wiring of their brains perhaps it altered which connections were active. Perhaps both. What the cases do neatly illustrate is the subjectivity of color, and by extension, of all our perceptions. If you can hear a note and see turquoise one day and hear the same note but see no color the next, then you have to conclude color is not intrinsic to the note. Even the color we see from real objects are our brains’ interpretations of wavelengths of light bouncing off that object. (Cough, The Dress.) That’s why AB could report perceiving colors that were “not even real colors. ” “It’s a really fascinating insight into how the brain generates internally a representation of a color,” and how the brain could generate it wrong, says Mitchell. For people with synesthesia, those colors they experience are also no different than the colors of real objects. Brang says he knows of people who stopped taking antidepressants for Seasonal Affective Disorder because they couldn’t stand losing their synesthesia. “It actually worsened their depression,” he says. “The loss of these color experiences had muted their world. ” It was like losing a sense. “Each person has their own unique window into the universe. Synesthesia is just a remarkable demonstration  of that,” says Peter Grossenbacher, a psychologist at Naropa University who has also studied people with synesthesia. Some of us have just looked through more than one window into the universe, not by choice but through (mis) fortune, drugs, and head trauma."
The Atlantic Daily: The Tangled Web,Atlantic,Rosa Inocencio Smith,2017-01-06,"        This article is part of a feature we also send out via email as The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter with stories, ideas, and images from The Atlantic, written specially for subscribers. To sign up, please enter your email address in the field provided here.     The Russia Report: The Office of the Director of National Intelligence has released a declassified version of its report on Russian interference with the U. S. election, following a Senate hearing on the subject yesterday. The report concludes that while hackers did not attempt to meddle directly with vote counts, the Russian government did order a series of cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns in order to help Donald Trump win the election. However, it doesn’t make any new evidence public, and it’s unlikely to sway any of those who still doubt Russia’s role —  including Trump himself. The  ’s friendliness toward Russia sets him apart from most members of his own party as well as from Democrats. But he’s not alone among other populist leaders in Europe, who see Russian President Vladimir Putin as a   for conservative values as well as for goals like fighting ISIS and reducing dependence on global trade. Working Knowledge: The final jobs report of 2016 (and of the Obama presidency) was released today by the Labor Department, which found that December completed a record 75 months of job growth. Such growth has been a major accomplishment of Obama’s time in office, but jobs —  and particularly the loss of careers in manufacturing —  are also a big source of Trump supporters’ dissatisfaction with the outgoing president. Why the disconnect? A visit to one factory in Indiana shows flaws in both sides of the narrative: Manufacturing jobs are actually increasing in some specialized fields, but they require more education than similar jobs have had in the past. Meanwhile, some companies are canceling promised raises for their workers, as an executive order that would have raised the threshold for overtime pay looks like it may never get implemented. Banking Business: As Treasury Secretary nominee Steve Mnuchin prepares for a new job in the Trump administration, documents from the very department he’s been chosen to lead are casting doubt on his record, showing that in 2011, Mnuchin’s bank —  OneWest in California —  was accused by Treasury Department regulators of mishandling foreclosures. Also troubling: A new investigation by the Wall Street Journal shows that Trump owes business debt to more than 150 financial institutions, creating a web of conflicts of interest that could prove nearly impossible to navigate. Ian Bogost on the White House’s archive of the “first   presidency”: To sneer at the White House’s efforts in this regard is sure to make me seem like a spoilsport or a killjoy.

Will ArchiveSocial’s search tool not prove useful to amateur and professional historians alike? Yes, of course. But these projects also affirm the dark underbelly of the social media era. The compression of complex ideas into tweetable  . The victory of sentiment and affect over reason and fact on the internet. The belief that large information archives can produce knowledge of the present, and of history, by exalting data correlation over all other methods of knowledge production. The tendency to privilege technological discourse over all other topics. The celebration of   contests and hackathons, pursued with an entrepreneur’s   attention, as the ultimate means of invention.   …     As Obama leaves office, the digital tools he quietly celebrated have also hollowed out American life. Keep reading here, as Ian reflects on the effectiveness of Obama’s   presence —  and the limits of his response to the digital web in terms of policy.

Answers: parasites, norway, metal, Over at the TAD forum, Atlantic readers discussed Clare Foran’s latest piece, “The Democrats Face a Daunting Future. ” The most   comment: Democrats need to resist Trump without calling Trump’s voters morons. Based on my Facebook feed, this may be very difficult for some of them to do. Another reader notes: In 2009, Republicans only controlled 14 state legislatures. [Now they control 33, a legislative dominance not seen since the Civil War.] Certainly the 2010 redistricting and gerrymandering had an effect, but the state of the local Dem party is not too far out of whack from what should be expected after eight years of a Democratic president. I’ll say that Republicans are traditionally very good at nationalizing local races. But following Trump’s victory, not being the White House incumbent party should help Democrats on its own.
