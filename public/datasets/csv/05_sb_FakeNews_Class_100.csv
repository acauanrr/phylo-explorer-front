according to the syrian dissidents news website enab muhaysini has released a video recently in which he appreciated riyadh and other arab states for equipping his comrades with missiles
the saudi preacher said that the missiles that they have sent would be used to break the syrian army and its allies siege of aleppo
he also thanked turkey for supporting the terrorists and treating the wounded militants in its hospitals
jaish alfatah is a conglomerate of terrorist groups with alnusra fatah alsham front comprising its main body
in relevant remarks in june a source said that saudi arabia has sent new cargoes of weapons and financial aid to the terrorists in aleppo in northern syria to strengthen them against the syrian army and its allies fresh attacks

also a prominent syrian military analyst said earlier this month that the terrorists in aleppo take orders from outside and dont dare to leave the city in anticipation of punishment by saudi arabia and turkey
violation of the ceasefire by the terrorists and their opposition to the evacuation of aleppo is of no surprise as they are not the ones in charge of the decisionmaking for remaining or leaving the city rather they take orders from the regional and international sides for whom they are working turki hassan told fna last saturday
noting that the main cause of the terrorists stubborn stay in aleppo is that leaders of fatah alsham formerly known as alnusra front and ahrar alsham are afraid of punishment by their qatari saudi and turkish masters he said if they move in defiance of their qatari saudi and turkish lords they might be killed and their properties be seized",english,ahtribune.com,http://ahtribune.com/images/media/ISIS_Electrocution_6072b.jpg,bs,Fake

a security official general bassam attiyah said a vehicle carrying around  kilograms of explosives was found near the stadium he added that the suspects had planned to either target people in the stadiums parking lot or fans watching the match
another equally horrifying scenario would have occurred he added had the device exploded whilst the spectators were exiting the stadium
he noted that the blast radius would have been something around  meters which would have covered an area of almost  square meters

Harun Yahya,2016-10-30T02:00:00.000+02:00,gruesome video shows turkish soldiers execute female kurdish pkk fighters by shooting in their heads,"bill clinton and his cabinet members pursued antiindia activities and as secretary of state hillary did the same as president she will no doubt continue to bully india  shares
   
there are only weeks left until we find out if we have a president trump or a president clinton donald trump is perceived as the candidate who is against the corrupt establishment while hillary clinton is seen as part and fabric of the establishment and as the most corrupt candidate to run for president in the history of the country
a president clinton in a few weeks would return us to the hostile climate towards india that we saw in the s overseen by her husband after he took office in  the us relationship with india went on a considerable downslide for nearly a year clinton did not bother appointing an ambassador to india even as he went about opposing india on multiple fronts leading to anger in the indian establishment initially he was intent on disarming and weakening india by preventing access to technology and also mounted a sustained attack on the indian economy by imposing several economic sanctions
in  senator joe biden who is now the vice president under barack obama introduced an amendment in the bill granting aid to russia making the aid conditional on the fact that russia could not sell cryogenic engines for indias space programme the clinton administration was hellbent on hurting the development of indias space and technology sectors and blocked the sale of cray supercomputers that had been approved under the ronald reagan administration india was also targeted for several economic sanctions and was threatened under what was called the super  clause of the american trade law
these economic sanctions were specifically borne out in the way mr clinton attacked the indian textile and carpet industries throughout the s the terms dunkel draft super  wto and patent laws became synonyms for the us attempts to retard the indian economy and led to many protests in india
by  india was justified in believing that indous relations had hit the lowest point but things took a dramatic turn for the worse during bill clintons second term in office madeleine albright became the new secretary of state and she was increasingly hostile to india especially through her pseudoracist television outbursts in fact she loved attacking india so much she went at it after leaving office and called for a plebiscite in kashmir justifying the actions of violent groups in the process
more clintons policies look like a death sentence for americans  things to expect with a hillary clinton presidency hillary clinton must be indicted how hillary clinton ushered in a one party dictatorship of monopoly capital remember this is the same bloodsoaked albright who advocated bombing yugoslavia and then got her investment firm to attempt a takeover of mines in that country like the clintons she also knows how to abuse her power lest we forget albright also justified the deaths of half a million iraqi children and claimed that the deaths were worth it and the icing on the cake for this particularly nasty woman albright has already threatened women in america and claimed that there was a special place in hell reserved for them if they did not vote for hillary clinton
there is already talk of joe biden in the frame as secretary of state under hillary clinton biden would continue his antiindia agenda and try to thwart the development of indias space programme and other technological advancements then of course there is hillarys closest confidante a duplicitous lady called huma abedin who is of pakistani descent and whose family has links to radical elements in pakistan and saudi arabia abedin could end up playing an important role in determining american foreign policy and would be certainly antimodi
another point against hillary clinton is that the hawkish henry kissinger has supports her and her oeuvre as secretary of state this is the same kissinger who is so hostile against india many of his racist statements are even on tape to that end
it is in the light of this setting that many indianamericans have opposed the candidacy of hillary clinton and have come out in support of donald trump in contrast to the policies of the clintons trump has promised to make india the best friend of the us and has stated that he looks forward to working with prime minister narendra modi trump has also reached out to hindus in us while there is always a risk of the unknown and it is not clear if trump can make the change he wants to a hillary presidency will certainly be a major step back for india
in order for india to build a constructive relationship with us it requires people in both countries to have good intentions it is clear that india cannot have a strong and forward looking relationship with the us if hillary clinton is running the corridors of power on the other hand donald trump has articulated the right intent and his stance holds promise for india",english,ahtribune.com,http://ahtribune.com/images/media/Turkey_PKK_e0749.JPG,bs,Fake

an elite stratum of wealthy and politically dominant people intends to make hillary clinton our next president these are the oligarchs the  whose wealth and incomes continue growing while most american struggle in her private life hillary clinton is wellpositioned among this cohort and they expect her as president to protect their wealth and maintain their dominance she will
to assure the oligarchs success the democratic national committee is brutalizing the presidential electoral process willfully violating rules laws and precedent the strategy succeeded in the primary elections and it will win the general
who are these people the top  of wealthholders numbers about  million predominantly they are citizens whose wealth depends on the huge american domestic and transnational corporations either directlyexecutives directors investors contractors suppliersor indirectly in other ways eg investment bankers hedge fund managers consultants top law firms two preeminent names in this grouping are hillary and bill clinton whose net worth about  million qualifies the couple for the  stratum by a factor of  others are wall street bankersthe clintons primal financial benefactors and firstname friends lloyd blankfein jamie dimon robert rubin brian moynihan michael corbat james gorman timothy geithner john stumpf etc a more accurate description of the  would be the corporate elite 
candidate clintons relationship to her elite compatriots is one of rigid interdependence she needs their financial and political resources to win the election and they need her in the white house to sustain their privileged status
this privileged status did not result from accident random chance or neglect it is a consequence of public policies consciously adopted over the past three or four decades which shift wealth and incomes systematically upward cutting taxes for corporations and the wealthy for example while exporting  of the nations manufacturing jobs in the process our democracy was transformed public policy is crafted today not primarily to advance the welfare of the nations people but to create protect or enhance the financial interests of american corporate enterprise this is acknowledged in the statements of public figures and supported in rigorous scholarly research 
more a new email investigation on clinton could hasten the democratic partys demise the banana republic of america democracy be damned to the superdelegates stand tall in statesmanship anointment of hillary clinton exposes a democracy that never was though easily identifiable the corporate elite has not constructed a conscious conspiracy against the american people at large with a preplanned agenda strategy and tactics but they share a common mindset they are networked by personal acquaintance and they are driven by a common imperative their wealth and political dominance depend on the existing configurations of american domestic and foreign policy both of which must be maintained essentially intact to sustain the groups position of privilege alterations in the status quo can be tolerated only if they are cosmetic slight and at the margin
instead of conspiracy the preeminence of the oligarchs is better seen as a malignant condition of contemporary american government resulting from years of institutional decay and corruption  the story of moribund democracy is detailed here  the economic and political power of megacorporationsincreasingly fewer but ever largerhas displaced functional democracy
yes we vote as we always have but voting and democracy are not interchangeable terms the russian people voted for vladimir putin the iraqis voted for saddam hussein and voting isnt a prerequisite for democracy to function the ancient greeks chose their representatives by lottery
the priority of corporate interests has been achieved by three powerful mechanisms
perhaps the least recognized is the degree to which corporate personnel enter government to staff the highest levels of the executive branch
a new book by political scientists bastiaan van apeldoorn and nana de graaff carries a sobering title american grand strategies and corporate elite networks  they looked into the grand strategy makers the  most influential people in cabinetlevel and senior advisory positions in the last three administrationsbill clintons bushs and obamas in the clinton administration  of the  grand strategy makers  were linked to  different transnational or financial corporations as executives directors senior associates or partners in law firms either prior to their public service or after it in the bush administration  of the   had connections to  corporations in the obama administration  of the  over  had such toplevel corporate affiliations with  companies
smoking guns examples of wealthshifting upward to the already rich certainly  the repeal of the glasssteagall act rammed through in the bill clinton administration by treasury secretary robert rubin from citigroup this enabled the subprime loan frenzy enriching the new york banks but destroying  trillion in americans household wealth  halliburtons nobid obscenely profitable contracts in iraq served up by vice president richard cheney during the bush administration billions of taxpayers dollars to the corporation mr cheney once chaired  in the obama administration treasury secretary timothy geithner from wall street administered the troubled asset relief program bailing out his colleagues banks again with billions of taxpayers money
for the last  years the executive branch has been dominated by the corporate elite
two other mechanisms of corporate influence are far more familiar the corporate financing of political campaigns and the ubiquitous enterprise of lobbying
the two practices are related in direct proportion the more you accept in contributions from boeing say the more you feel obligated to yield to their lobbyists wishes
your policymaking independence will decrease then as the costs of campaigning rise and contemporary costs are staggering a representative today must raise on average  million in campaign funding a senator  million a presidential race runs in the hundreds of millions hillary clinton has taken in  million since citizens united corporate campaign funding has no limits and with candidates in need of so many millions the corporate capture of federal governance is undeniable and scarcely surprising
undeniable but easily surmounted we once had a law on the books the uk still does limiting not campaign contributions but campaign expenditures the limits were  for a senate race  for a representative sums easily provided from personal assets and those of family and friends reenacting such a law would break the corporate stranglehold intense lobbying might continue but no senator no representative would feel the courteous urge to accommodate the welfare of the american people could regain priority the impact on the oligarchs however would be apocalyptic
the commitment of the corporate elite to sustain the status quo is apparently absolute by april of  the democratic national committee and the clinton campaign were one indistinguishable juggernaut intent on blitzing the presidential campaign like hitlers wehrmacht stormed through europe the watch words seemed to be first and most they amassed an early warchest of a hundred million dollars or so and lined up  superdelegate endorsementsall before there was a single announced opponent they invited  print and television journalists to meetings in early april to help in framing the hrc message and framing the race  among them were george stephanoplous and  others from abc rachel maddow and  more from msnbc gloria borger and  of her colleagues from cnn and  from the new york times bloomberg politico and cbs each sent along two
the firstandmost strategy worked secretary clinton preempted the candidate space the only others attracted to the race were lackluster lightweights especially the wooly socialist from vermont but senator sanders electrifying rallies made tangible the disgust of the american people with the status quo  sanders proposals were anything but cosmetic slight and at the margin they posed a mortal threat to the corporate elite and its guardian the clinton campaign to minimize sanders exposure dnc chair wassermanschultz limited the number of debates and scheduled them on weekends and opposite football games sanders had to sue to gain access to the dncs voter database the deliberate tilting of the democratic primaries gained momentum
to minimize sanders exposure dnc chair wassermanschultz limited the number of debates and scheduled them on weekends and opposite football games
this may not be the first election in which ethics and law were abandoned but never before has it been so reliably exposed
not by the mainstream media though they either ignored the increasingly evident fraud or were complicit in it from the iowa caucuses onward the press treated clintons superdelegate endorsements as tallied votes this continued even after the distortion and dishonesty of doing so were pointed out based on precisely that deception however the associated press announced clintons presumptive nomination on monday june one day before primaries were held in california montana new jersey north and south dakota and the district of columbia from iowa forward also the washington post and the new york times hammered the sanders campaign without mercy or interruption the story was detailed later by thomas frank in harpers magazine   frank concludes i have never before seen the press take sides like they did this year openly and even gleefully badmouthing candidates who did not meet with their approval 
no the major media failed to expose the fraud but the social media and the internet abounded with skepticism sanders fans questioned the uncounted caucuses in iowa the  reduction of polling places in maricopa county arizona the disqualified sanders delegates at the nevada convention the cheapshot call by the associated press many were certain the clinton campaign and the democratic national committee were joined at the hip but there was scant factual evidence
enter julian assange and the leaked dnc emails now the illegal collusion was documented the sabotaging of the sanders campaign exposed wassermanschultz resigns as dnc chair then the podesta emails and hillarys paid speeches you need both a public position and a private position my dream is a hemispheric open market with open trade and open borders dnc vicechair donna brazile a cnn pundit emails the clinton campaign prior to the debate from time to time i get the questions in advance the attempt to reschedule the illinois primary another tranche of emails arrives braziles complicity with the clinton campaign is broadened she is firedresigns from her cnn post the clinton foundation hosts pay to play the clintons personal enrichment the  million deal with king mohammed vi of morocco
finally the compliant mass media did take note this is after all fine spectacle noted but not pursued no determined effort was undertaken to investigate to document further the deceit and dishonesty and to assess its magnitude
once again that was left to the citizenry the first careful detailed study was published june   by two scholars axel geijel of tilburg university and rodolfo cortes barragan at stanford it is entitled are we witnessing a dishonest election they compared states whos voting systems produced verifying paper trails against states which did not sanders won the papertrail states where tampering with machine tallies could be quickly discovered clinton overpowered in states without paper trails where tampering could never be detected the authors also compared voting machine tallies with exit poll figures and found disturbing discrepancies they concluded these data suggest that election fraud is occurring in the  democratic party presidential primary election this fraud has overwhelmingly benefited secretary clinton at the expense of senator sanders the paper can be found here 
then with the primaries concluded a group of outraged patriots with day jobs organized as election justice usa  published an exhaustive report the study is entitled democracy lost a report on the fatally flawed  democratic primaries  and it is available here  it details in  pages of carefully assembled and compelling evidence examples of election fraud uncovered in four categories voter suppression registration tampering illegal voter purging and fraudulent voting machine tallies in eleven states the group found discrepancies between exit polls and voting machine counts exceeding the statistical margins of error every single discrepancy favored secretary clintonand no such discrepancies occurred in the republican counts the groups conclusion was troubling  elected delegates their report argues persuasively were awarded fraudulently to clinton and denied sanders accordingly
that gave her the edge in delegate count going into the convention in the end however she needed the additional votes of  unelected superdelegates those empowered by the democratic national committee even after a primary season documented as fraudulent then hillary clintons nomination was achieved by fiat not democracy
but the corporate elite will not be denied given the clintondnc expertise and success in tipping the primary elections she will be elected president in the general election guaranteed
the manipulation of the primaries was obscure but not invisible a backlash of outrage might have been anticipated the clintondnc people however are unmatched in hubris and geniuses in the practice of deceit scandals were not even acknowledged defiantly ignored and the language of progressive democracy is omnipresent in the campaigning brilliant deception hillary clinton promises to work for main street not wall street she promises to bring back jobs improve education seek equal pay for women boost the minimum wage expand civil rights provide free college education move toward medicare for all oppose tpp break up the toobigtofail wall street banks fine appealing proposals all but this is the language of sanders revolution and the corporate elite will stand for none of it
but folk wisdom tells us to take campaign promises lightly and the american people are forgiving and trusting hillary clinton is a woman of long experience and we want to believe our democracy is robust
here now we need to be vigilant

mohsen abdelmoumen  do you think the united states can claim to be democratic simply by electing a woman president can we talk about democracy in the usa with a candidate of the financial lobbies and aipac
ann garrison no of course not no more than we could claim to be a democracy because we elected a black president these two elections signify nothing more than the inclusion of previously excluded classes of people in the super elite the united states is an oligarchy of the   of the  any president who is not already among the  like bill clinton becomes part of the  by serving its interests and then peddling influence after leaving office no one has developed an influence peddling machine as welloiled as the clintons with bill working the clinton foundation and the clinton global initiative while hillary was secretary of state just imagine the new depths of corruption that the next eight years and beyond could bring obama has said hes now considering a move from the white house to venture capitalism that has silicon valley slathering at the opportunity
every four years americans are given the illusion of choice between oligarchs andor aspiring oligarchs who will serve the interests of oligarchy candidates who aspire to actually represent the interests of the people are marginalized by the corporate media and the paytoplay campaign contributions of the oligarchs
in municipal and county elections and ballot measures americans often do have real choices but the higher and more powerful the office the greater the corruption and oligarchic control nevertheless only a small minority of americans actually vote n local elections the atlantics citylab reporting project recently concluded that fewer than  vote in mayoral elections in  of the  most populous cites disengagement is one of the most fundamental facts of american political life
regarding federal elections this concept of democracy within the largest most lethal military power the world has ever seen is bogus to begin with when us citizens cast ballots to elect a new commanderinchief who will continue the project of perpetual war military industrial profits and global hegemony how democratic is that the vast majority of those who will suffer and die dont get to vote the only exceptions are members of the us armed services who die in us wars if those on the other side of the pentagons crosshairs were able to vote im sure they would elect our green party presidential candidate jill stein who said we say to trump we dont need no friggin wall we just need to stop invading other countries her running mate vice presidential candidate ajamu baraka has called the humanitarian interventionist argument a new version of the white mans burden and said you have to ask yourself when was the last time the us has been on the side of the people and the answer is never
more top aide to hillary clinton urges the fbi to disclose what it knows about trumps russia ties what will hillary clinton do for india not much and heres why clintons policies look like a death sentence for americans  things to expect with a hillary clinton presidency how do you explain the dynastic governance clinton is the american dream in all its glory
im not sure i can explain the clinton dynasty except to agree that it is one chelsea has been very involved in the clinton foundation and is quite likely to enter political life and even run for president one day we have had other political dynasties most notably the roosevelts the kennedys and the bushes and there are many lower level dynasties like the browns in california jerry brown the current governor of california is the son of former california governor pat brown new york state has the cuomos governor andrew cuomo is the son of former governor mario cuomo and his brother chris cuomo is a prominent corporate television host
regarding the american dream i assume youre referring to the dream that if you work hard and play by the rules you can achieve some proportionate degree of status security and prosperity if so the clintons certainly arent living the american dream because although they did well in school theyve hardly played by the rules theyve enriched themselves with that welloiled influence peddling operation i mentioned earlier the clinton foundation and the clinton global initiative were all wondering whether hillary clinton and maybe even bill clinton might finally be indicted now that the fbi has reopened its investigation of clinton email because more of it was discovered on the laptop that anthony weiner  a former congressman under fbi investigation for sex offense  shared with his wife clinton aide huma abedin if hillary clinton is elected shell have to be impeached convicted and removed from office but thats extremely unlikely  no matter whats in the newly discovered email  if her party the democrats win a majority in the house and more than a one third minority in the senate it takes a majority in the house to impeach a president and a twothirds majority in the senate to then convict and remove a president so hillary clinton is at a berlusconi moment in her sordid career her best chance of avoiding indictment is getting elected getting back to the american dream that you can get ahead by working hard and playing by the rules bill clinton was impeached by the house of representatives for perjury and obstruction of justice regarding his affair with a yearold white house intern and his testimony in a sexual harassment lawsuit brought by another former employee however his own party held a majority in the senate and they acquitted him this was all legal according to the us constitution but does it really sound like he was playing by the rules during the final days of his presidency clinton acquitted glencore international founder mark rich an international fugitive who had fled to switzerland his exwife had donated to the democratic national committee the clinton presidential library and hillary clintons new york senate campaign
according to the law president clinton had the authority to acquit rich but how would any rational person consider that anything but bribery and corruption
in  clinton polished the reputation of president nursultan nazarbayev kazakhstans autocratic leader and human rights offender who then gave a uranium mining lease to canadian businessman frank giustras shell company making it worth tens of millions of dollars overnight giustra then made a big contribution to the clinton foundation no one has claimed that this was illegal but is it playing by the rules
when guistra sold a majority stake in his company uranium one to rosatom the russian atomic energy agency it was approved by secretary of state hillary clinton giustra then contributed  million to the clinton foundation and bill clinton was offered a  speaking engagement with a russian investment bank with links to the kremlin does that sound like playing by the rules and now hillarys trying to make us believe that russias meddling in our elections and threatening confrontation with russia over syria i dont think shes kidding about the confrontation but the clinton foundation rarely passes up the chance to make another million dollars or more in any circumstances
meanwhile most of the rest of us are not living the american dream sixtythree percent of americans are living on the edge of financial catastrophe unable to handle a  car repair or a  emergency room bill  the clintons as i said serve the oligarchy they have also managed to join when bill clinton was on his way out in the last months of his presidency he worked with republicans in the lame duck congress to deregulate the banking industry by  its dishonest excessive and abusive financialization scams had crashed the economy costing millions of americans their jobs andor homes then as a new york senator hillary clinton voted to bail out the big banks who committed the crime while many of the rest of us struggled in the crashs wake
how do you explain that candidate clinton who failed as secretary of state with the death of the us ambassador in libya her health problems the scandal of emails is the candidate of the democrats
again clinton serves the interests of the oligarchy that she herself has joined many people believe that the nomination was stolen from bernie sanders the democratic candidate who spoke out against oligarchy growing income inequality and even the israeli lobbys dominance in american politics
but theres one other important element to this americans who identify as liberals supporters of womens rights andor antiracists have such a longstanding allegiance to the democratic party that supporting its nominee every four years is their kneejerk reaction ever escalating foreign wars dont seem to penetrate their consciousness or conscience especially when those wars are waged primarily with drones and proxy armies instead of us troops and once the republicans nominated the openly racist and misogynistic donald trump defeating trump became a liberal crusade
there are of course glimmers of rationality and hope yesterday i was out canvassing for an oakland california ballot measure with a young black man a college sophomore despite trumps overt racism he told me that he considers clinton even more dangerous because he understands that she has essentially promised confrontation with russia over syria he understands that such escalation increases the chance of a nuclear war accidental or not and that trump for all his faults says that the cold war is over that nato is largely obsolete and that clinton is recklessly risking confrontation with russia by promising to remove bashar alassad
our green party presidential candidate jill stein is reported to be polling at  among voters under  and much of bernie sanderss support was quite visibly from the same age group local grassroots organizing is also empowering people to create institutions free of oligarchic and corporate control they include community gardens renewable energy buyers cooperatives and gmofree zones if a ballot initiative to make californias sonoma county gmofree passes the whole northwest coast of california will be a gmofree zone from santa cruz to humboldt counties and including one inland county trinity
dont you think that the twoheaded american system with the candidates of two traditional parties democratic and republican is out of breath
i wouldnt say its out of breath because its still very much in control however trump has left the republican party in disarray with many republican luminaries and funders defecting to clinton who is welcoming them with open arms as black agenda report editor glen ford has written  the clintons have succeeded in assembling under one party roof nearly the whole of the us ruling class and their hordes of attendants and goons the scam that undergirded the duopoly system that has served the lords of capital so well for so long has come undone thanks to a white nationalist billionaire who was too spoiled to play by the corporate rules the two parties of the ruling class have become one
its hard to say whether or not the republican party will survive this election or what it will be in another four years if it does
one possibility could significantly change this if green party presidential candidate dr jill stein wins  in this election the green party will become an official national party eligible for  of the federal funds made available to official national parties to host their presidential nominating conventions and support their nominee this year all federal funds went to the two official national parties republicans and democrats who also have access to huge amounts of plutocratic and corporate money the greens take no corporate money
five percent of the vote and five percent of the federal funding for elections may not sound like much but it would be a huge watershed for the us greens it would be a big psychological and visibility boost and it would mean starting the next presidential campaign year with more than twice the funds that jill steins campaign has been able to raise
winning  would also ensure ballot access for the greens in most states not only in federal elections but also in down ballot races as it is greens are required to spend much of their time and money just gathering enough signatures to satisfy all the byzantine ballot access requirements that vary in each of the  states
everyone knows that clinton is the future president of the usa in your opinion why they are facilitated her task and who has interest in seeing clinton in the oval office
she is backed by the oligarchy corporate and dynastic particularly the investment bankers the oil industry and the weapons manufacturers who not only profit but also lobby for foreign wars they are advancing their own interests by promoting a candidate who will serve them liberals have been conditioned to function as unpaid clinton operatives in this election and the corporate media like the cops serve as protectors of the oligarchy and again the majority of americans are politically disengaged
you are close to jill stein head of the green party which emerged late in the campaign why was this alternative sabotaged
well i wouldnt say im close to jill personally but she knows who i am and i of course know who she is ive reported on her campaign and on the us greens for the past year on radio and in print and online outlets and im always honored when she shares those reports on her social media pages i write for the black agenda report and feel politically and intellectually close to its editors who have given their full support to the green party this year even as bernie sanders surged in the polls and many imagined he might actually win the democratic nomination in these times that are so easy to see as the end times shared rationality and humanity are the closest bonds that many of us have regardless of the geographic distance between us
jills campaign could hardly compete with the republicans and democrats because neither she nor any other greens solicit or accept corporate money we stand behind the slogan people and planet before profits and we call for a halt to the death march led by the weapons manufacturers fossil fuel giants and agrochemical companies who profit from it jill calls for immediately cutting the military budget by half closing all the us military bases in foreign countries and launching a peace offensive she proposes free public education from kindergarten through college the abolition of student debt national health insurance and a green new deal that would reinvest the resources now squandered on weapons manufacture and all the illegal immoral lethal and environmentally catastrophic us wars the green new deal would create a renewable energy infrastructure and sustainable agriculture before its too late to stop the climate meltdown  if it isnt too late already and it would fully employ americans in meaningful dignified and cooperative work for the common good
of course that all makes far too much sense and threatens the highly concentrated wealth and power of the deathmarch industries i would not be surprised if there were voter fraud to prevent jill stein and ajamu baraka from winning the  that would make us an official national party
i have also seen enormous oligarchic determination to stop greens at the local level in  matt gonzalez the green partys mayoral candidate in san francisco seemed to have a good chance of winning that so alarmed the democratic party that it sent all its best known most powerful names and faces to san francisco to campaign for the democratic candidate they sent hillary and bill they sent jesse jackson they sent many democratic party superstars more than once they seemed to be more concerned about defeating matt gonzalez and the greens in san francisco than they were about defeating george bush and the republicans in the following years presidential election
one of the founders of the san francisco green party was elected to the city and county board of supervisors twice but when he ran for sheriff an executive office democrats pulled him aside and said they could not allow his election unless he left the greens and joined the democratic party which he did they still got rid of him after his first term with a really ugly campaign but thats another complicated story in itself the city and county of san francisco once had more elected greens than any city or county in the country but many of those that greens worked so hard to elect have since defected to the democratic party for the sake of their political careers
is not hillary clinton a danger for humanity
hell yes i agree with congolese author and political activist patrick mbeko who said shes more dangerous than isis for all the reasons ive already mentioned her dark alliance with the deathmarch industries and her seeming eagerness to confront russia over syria andor on russias borders in the interest of global hegemony russian uranium deal aside i think that diana johnstone was most likely right when she wrote that her strategic ambition in a nutshell is regime change in russia
and i have to mention my friends from the african great lakes region  particularly uganda rwanda burundi and the democratic republic of the congo  which became the killing grounds of the s as the us using african proxies established itself as the dominant power there most of my friends from that part of the world are horrified by the clintons all but certain return to the white house the clintons are deeply committed to the false history of the rwandan war and massacres that was used to justify the first and second congo wars and later the humanitarian interventions in libya syria and iraq if the truth about rwanda and dr congo were known bill clinton would be implicated in mass murder but thats true of every us president in office in my lifetime and probably long before that no ones going to try to refer the most lethal military power in history to an international criminal court with more than symbolic authority
you have many worked on africa how do you explain the french leadership in africa
well im no expert in this but i can say a few things
first i wouldnt call it leadership id say that france sustains a neocolonial and military presence in africa france was a partner in the destruction of libya in mali niger the central african republic and the democratic republic of congo france is protecting the uranium mines essential to the nuclear power that generates  of its electricity theres no doubt that france was complicit in the assassination of resource nationalist and debt resister president thomas sankara and the installation of president blaise compaoré in burkina faso i dont see any sign that french policy towards burkina or any of its other former colonies is any more benign now despite its resignation to compaorés ouster by a popular movement
france and the us now appear to be military partners in africa more often than not but during the rwandan war and massacres and the congo wars of the s the us displaced france as the dominant power there
however a source of ongoing tension between france and the us has been their divergent accounts of the massacres known as the rwandan genocide the us defends rwandan president paul kagames account in which he is the savior who swept in to stop the carnage kagame blames france particularly for operation turquoise in which french troops created a humanitarian corridor for rwandan refugees mostly hutus who were fleeing the advance of kagames rwandan patriotic army this conflict has recently been renewed first with france reopening its investigation of allegations that kagame ordered the assassination of rwanda and burundis hutu presidents juvenal habyarimana and cyprien ntaryamira in  rwanda responded by accusing  french officers of helping to plan and organize genocide in rwanda
in  nicholas sarkozy attempted to ease the tension between france and the us and rwanda by accepting the usrwandan account of the massacres he publicly apologized for frances alleged guilt in rwandas tragedy  and shortly thereafter france was rewarded with greater access to dr congos resource riches however alain juppé who was the french prime minister at the time of the rwandan massacres and operation turquoise was having none of that he even left the country during kagames  reconciliaton visit to paris  now juppé seems to be leading sarkozy in the bid for his partys nomination and if he is elected president the history of rwanda and dr congo in the s will be more fiercely contested most of my rwandan friends very much hope that juppé will be elected because he defends the dissident history of what really happened they believe for one that operation turquoise saved many rwandan lives
while africa is a young continent how do you explain that the countries are often directed by old presidents with several mandates and who dont want lose the power
the old presidents cling to power and the western powers with geostrategic interests enable them because autocrats are easier to corrupt and control than rowdy democrats and resource nationalists who try to represent their own people rwandas kagame and ugandas museveni are two prime examples of autocrats who have proven very useful to the us and other western interests
france the us and all the rest of the nato nations appear to be united in their determination to topple burundis nkurunziza who has dared to raise an independent head and to favor the east particularly russia in resource extraction contracts i cant explain mugabes hold on power at age  or omar albashirs at  since neither are us aliies youll have to ask africans in those countries to explain that
in your opinion is not tribalism a major factor in the destabilization of africa why doesnt africa progress and does it stay in the tribal model
i really hesitate to say anything about that because im not african myself and i think western media often use the word tribe as a racial slur that disguises western resource interests at play in african conflicts i recently wrote a piece about the new film a brilliant genocide  and milton allimadi the ugandanborn editor of the black star news told me he loved the piece but asked me to remove the one instance in which id used the word tribe i told him id been hesitant about using that word and was glad to remove it im now reading his book  hearts of darkness how white writers created the racist image of africa 
why are congolese being massacred in beni territory north kivu province  the first question ive asked to try to answer that question is what resources are there in beni the answer is oil timber gold diamonds wolfram coltan and cassiterite beni is a vivid example of the saying everybody wants a piece of congo no one could convince me that the industrial nations hunger for all these riches is not at the heart of these conflicts why are all the deadly ethnic conflicts in dr congos resourcerich eastern provinces
the competition andor animosity between ethnicities or groups is often real as they are in the west but in africa the geostrategic and resource interests of the industrial nations are always in play behind the scenes western powers often exacerbate local rivalries in pursuit of their own interests
i sometimes cohost a show called afrobeatradio with my friend wuyi jacobs on wbainew york city and we both hope to someday produce a show about rwanda and burundi in which we wont have to use the words hutu or tutsi dr léopold munyakazi convinced me that these two groups are better understood not as tribes or ethnicities but as social classes in rwandan history that were exaggerated by europeans who have found it convenient to pit one group against the other
libya lives total chaos how do you analyze the situation in libya
its horrible like so much else it makes me deeply ashamed to be an american if you read hillary clintons email its easy to see that the usnato war on libya was for one another western war against another defiant resource nationalist muammar gaddafi regardless of whatever human rights offenses gaddafi or saddam hussein were guilty of both were resource nationalists as was mohammed mossadegh the secular democratically elected prime minister of iran who nationalized iranian oil before our cia and the uks m ousted him in the  coup i wrote about how this played out in libya in  clinton email we came we saw we got oil 
obama says that failing to prepare for the aftermath of the libyan war was the greatest mistake of his presidency but id say his greatest mistake was waging the libyan war in the first place like the iraq war it has created chaos and perpetual war that continues to spread through the middle east and north africa

the signing of the comprehensive economic trade agreement with canada ceta on the th of october marks the beginning of north americas annexation of europe the negotiations for the treaty were carried out behind closed doors for over  deputies in the european parliament there are more than  thousands lobbyists the society for european affairs professionals seap  the organisation which lobbying on behalf of multinational corporations  this is the real power block in europe the european worker has absolutely no say and henceforth he will lose the right to form join unions multinational corporations will have unlimited power over european workers who will see the destruction of what is left of social gains won from over a century of class struggle
will european workers lie down and accept this imposture what concrete policies would weaken the stranglehold of corporations over european workers which parties in the current political landscape hold policies which if implemented would weaken the transatlantic stranglehold
there are currently no political parties running in the major european elections with candidates who genuinely represent workers interests but there are some political movements which threaten the corporate powerelite we will mention them below
there are two important geopolitical processes to consider here the first is the eastwest corporate  geopolitical axis america is pulling the european peninsula away from the eurasian continent with the installation of a neonazi regime in kiev washington attempted to recreate an intermarium from the baltic sea to the black sea and down to the eastern mediterranean  driving a permanent wedge between russia and germany
in order to facilitate the social transformation of europe into a america minor millions of pilgrims are necessary hence the deployment of coercive engineered migration as a tool to replace class conscious european workers with deracine youths  in some instances educated enough to do the lowpaid work assigned to them and acculturated enough to pose no problem to the powerelite
in the new trotskyite language of this imperial order any leader who attempts to stem the tide of globalisation through populist appeals to tradition and national identity is fascist fascist is a loaded term which generally connotes evil in the public mind in each european country there is a readymade army of youths from wealthy families whose job is to don hoddies attack police and scream fascist and racist at workingclass people desperately trying to find a way out of this nightmare these antifa are the modern equivalent to oswald mosleys fascist gangs in the s they represent the same class interests pettybourgeois leftism is the new world orders avantgarde
a favourite passtime of the antifa mob is throwing stones at police officers one can only gain acceptance in the antifascist gang by showing how much one hates the pigs so police officers from honest workingclass families get burned alive while the antifa mob chants slogans from the spanish civil war such violence is now a regular occurrence in demonstrations the agents provocateurs often receive help from the intelligence services french police are finding it hard to cope with the chaos developing all over french suburbs they complain that they are not sufficiently equipped and do not have the powers necessary to deal with the growing violence from delinquents they have been demonstrating in paris they have been calling for an end to the control of the french police by free masonry exacerbating the problem is the deepseated racism of many police officers who target black youths with spotchecksm  very often without reason
the recent demonstrations by french police in france against poor working conditions and low pay strongly suggests that there is the possibility that the rank and file of the french police could be waking up to the reality that france is government by a criminal gang after the magnanville terrorist attack in june where two police officers were killed a police officer at the funeral of the deceased refused to shake the hand of president hollande and prime minister manuel valls it was a highly significant act of insubordination
the police who in capitalist societies are the guardians of the ruling class are beginning to realise the criminality of the people they are protecting they are perhaps beginning to understand that the role of the state is to impose the dictatorship of one class over another  that of the minority of super wealthy over the labouring masses
many of these dissident police officers are linked to le pens national front a reliable source in french intelligence informed me that the secret services spend more time watching the farright than the socalled far left they see the far right as a real potential danger to the ruling order whereas the far left present no danger but are in fact a key component of ruling class ideology from the arab spring to nuit debout the farleft are the lifeblood of capitalism the potential of a major split between the national and compradore bourgeoise of imperial states for prospects of workingclass gains is something that needs more study
what should we make of all this in the context of ceta as i have said on numerous occasions the far right in france are and always have been political opportunists who exploit the despair of the masses they serve the interests of the national bourgeoisie but the national front are regularly denounced by the media not for being right wing rather they are dismissed as being closer to the far left the prospect of raising workers salaries nationalisation of key industries and a halt on the importation of cheap labour appeal to workingclass families
as i have pointed out before looking at a debate between the trotskyist jeanluc melanchon and marine le pen in  one would have thought that le pen was was the leftist and melanchon the rightwing militarist melanchon shamelessly defended the nato bombing campaign of libya while le pen opposed it
civil war on the horizon
the rightwing presidential candidate philippe de villiers has said there are plans afoot to divide the french territory between muslims and nonmuslims he quote s francois hollandes own writings to back up his claims everyone is talking about an imminent civil war in the bars and cafes of paris one can hear more and more disgruntled french citizens talking about media disinformation the demonisation of russia the homogenisation of thought and the criminality of the ruling class
the scene has never been more propitious to a populist take over of french politics but one should not have illusions about the national front they are following the menacious zionist narrative on the war on terror muslims are the problem the partys vicepresident forian philippot is close to the ultrazionist lawyer gilleswilliam goldnagel a friend of israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu
philippot recently condemned the comments of presidential candidate jean frédéric poisson who said hillary clinton presented the greatest threat for the world as she is in the pay of the zionists poisson was subsequently forced to kneel before the representative council of jewish institutions in france crif where he sought forgiveness he was told he would be forgiven but they they would never forget in spite of the national fronts antimuslim bias an increasing number of muslims are voting for the party many muslims prefer the national front as they are sick and tired of being patronised and manipulated by the left  with their pseudo antiracism and humanitarian wars
there have also been major strikes by police in ireland for similar reasons to france french workers are losing everything and will soon become a lumpen proletariat meanwhile the french government has programmes in place to encourage migrants heading to britain to stay in france the socialist party is creating a new electorate it is a wise move for them because after the next election abstentionism will be the norm and the indigenous lumpen proletariat will resent the migrants the oligarchs will keep the masses in bondage through gmos takfiri antiislam and total reification of life ceta is the beginning of the end for social hope it is the prelude to the transatlantic trade and investment partnership ttip  the most evil trade deal in history

the palestine football association pfa in a first testing of palestines ability to fight its battle with israel in international courts plans to go to the worlds top court for sports in a bid to force its israeli counterpart to view israeli settlements on the west bank as occupied territory rather than an extension of the jewish state
the potential palestinian move follows the palestinian authoritys campaign to isolate israel in international organizations and challenge israels occupation of the west bank in the international criminal court icc
using soccer as a testing ground palestines efforts to confront israel in international organizations has produced mixed results while palestine succeeded in joining various international organizations the pfa last year failed to muster sufficient votes to persuade world soccer body fifa to suspend israel the pfa argued that the policies of the israeli government and the israel football association ifa violated fifa rules as well as international law governing the status of occupied territory
the pfa has since been unable to push fifa towards any punitive steps against israel instead fifa opted to monitor developments and attempt with little success to negotiate a way out of the impasse palestine is expected to take legal recourse if fifa fails to take more decisive action at its next council meeting in january
the pfas focus since failing to get israel suspended has been on banning six clubs that are based in israeli settlements on the west bank from playing in israeli lower divisions fifa rules stipulate that clubs based in a recognized federations territory cannot play in leagues of another soccer association without the permission of the home federation the pfa rejects the notion of granting permission because it believes that it would legitimize israeli settlements and the occupation
more swedish soccer player sent off for loud fart during match pfa president jibril rajoub suggested that the pfa would take its case to the court of arbitration for sport cas after a sevenhour meeting earlier this month of a fifa committee headed by tokyo sexwale failed to resolve the issue
mr sexwale is scheduled to visit israel later this month for a meeting with israeli sports minister miri regev the fifa council is scheduled to discuss the issue at its next meeting in january the pfa is likely to prepare its case for cas but wait with filing it until after the january meeting
israel sees the palestinian demands and threat as strengthening the growing boycott divestment and sanctions movement bds that sees penalization as a means of forcing the jewish state to alter its policies and ultimately withdraw from territory occupied during the  middle east war
condemnation of the israeli occupation and settlements by the united nations security council constitutes the legal basis for the pfas approach as well as potential challenges in international courts
the strength of the palestinian position has been weakened changing persian gulf attitudes towards israel and saudi and united arab emirates pressure on palestine authority president mahmoud abbas persian gulf states despite paying lip service to the palestinian cause have become more public about their informal relations with israel based on common opposition to expanding iranian influence in the region
writing in the kingdoms controlled press a prominent saudi journalist went as far as calling for the establishment of diplomatic relations with israel the uae last year agreed to the opening of an israeli diplomatic mission accredited to the abu dhabibased international renewable energy agency rather than the uae government bahrain as part of an agreement to host next years fifa congress has consented to issue visas to representatives of the ifa israeli nationals are barred from travelling to persian gulf countries
at the same time saudi arabia and the uae have been pressuring mr abbas to resolve his differences with mohammed dahlan the controversial former abu dhabibased gaza strongman who is an archenemy of the palestinian president mr dahlan is widely seen as a successor to year old mr abbas who would be acceptable to israel
israel may be able to count on some degree of tacit persian gulf support within fifa but is likely nonetheless to ultimately have to be seen to be accepting some kind of compromise that throws a bone to the palestinians
the palestinians focus on the israeli west bank teams has however raised the bar for israel an agreement between prime minister benyamin netanyahu and former fifa president sepp blatter struck last year addresses many of the pfas grievances but not the issue of six the west bank teams their status goes to the heart of the palestinianisraeli conflict the legal status of territory occupied by israel since 
under the agreement mr netanyahu proposed to give palestinian players special identity cards and place sports liaison officials at crossings between palestinian areas and those under israeli control in a bid to eliminate obstacles to free movement that complicated the development of palestinian soccer mr netanyahu further suggested to create an escort service that would facilitate players travel between the west bank and gaza that are separated by israeli territory
israel initially appeared to live up to its promises by granting for the first time in  years a west bank team hebrons al ahli passage to gaza to play a palestine cup final against the strips al shejaia hopes that this signalled a new beginning were however dashed when the pfa cancelled the return match in hebron after israel agreed to grant passage to only  of the  players who were scheduled to travel implementation of the agreement has since evaporated
the pfa by putting the west bank teams at the top of their agenda has made it tougher for fifa and israel to work out a compromise that would not have implications for the future of israelipalestinian peace making israeli is likely to want to avoid subjecting its policies to the scrutiny of an international court yet that may be exactly what would best serve the palestine authoritys overall strategy",english,ahtribune.com,http://ahtribune.com/images/media/Mosul_Civilians_83b52.jpg,bs,Fake

professor mike mahon president and vice chancellor lethbridge canada
dear professor mike mahon
it is with a sense of great sadness that i have learnt of the suspension without pay of professor anthony hall one of the most distinguished scholars not only of the  but a researcher and writer who is recognised and respected globally in a country like pakistan which is far behind canada in term of education research and scholarship no teacher or nonteacher of any university can be suspended without pay when someone is suspended he or she is entitled to draw full pay for the period of suspension if canada is doing better than us on various scales then one would expect that suspension without pay puts canada behind us in terms of due process and in terms of requirements demanded by the principles of justice and fair play i may add respectfully that in pakistani universities no one is generally suspended unless a fact finding committee has first looked into the matter thoroughly and found prima facie evidence of wrong doing the decision of the administration also destroys the concept of a tenured appointment
 from his writings that i have read over a period of time it is evident that professor anthony hall is a scholar whose work exposes the crimes and conspiracies of those who are taking the world headlong into a global war and simultaneously transforming it into a global slave state his analysis is impeccable and his grasp of facts masterly and his writings are devoid of any prejudice against any ethnic group or nation  or any university for that matter should have been proud to have professor hall on its faculty his suspension creates an impression even from this distance from where i write that certain powerful interests that aim destroying free speech have targeted people like professor anthony hall who speak out for democracy decency peace and justice
i have found out from the internet that bnai brithis behind this movement against shutting down free speech it is quite evident that the charge that professor anthony hall has created a discriminatory atmosphere is highly dubious to the contrary it appears that an antimuslim bias has been created in your institution by professor halls unfortunate suspensionthere is also a strong impression that bnai brith has taken over the administrative decision making at lethbridge
more suspension of tenured professor lacks due diligence toxic mind control contaminates the public sphere irish human rights activists against freedom of speech bnai brith attack on canadian professor has roots in zionist false flag tactics it is also worrying that bnai brith have now targeted canadian universities and canadian society if this is the case then the situation is disturbing not just for lethbridge and canada but for all freedom loving people worldwide when i was a young student at university of edinburgh scotland in the s i used to meet many canadian students and i found that they invariably stood for freedom of speech and for tolerance and justice the suspension of professor hall is inconsistent with my image of the canadian people that i had then formed
on behalf of the academic community of the university of the punjab established  i urge you to kindly reconsider your decision to suspend professor hall it will go a long way in rehabilitating the impression of people worldwide about the upholding of free speech academic freedom and genuine scholarly discourse at lethbridge

presenting and attendance million of shias at arbaeen create a massive and international unity among shias this capacity can be useful for huge cultural action
mashrigh and tasnim report that different religions ever require their followers to attend in specific days in the year for solidarity and correlation between followers to identify the social stream this kind of attendance is a good publicity of that social stream and influences the international community
easter the christians religious day
for example christians celebrate easter as the most important religious day with a long history every year
 this day is a holiday in christians calendar and followers of jesus christ hold various ceremonies and celebration in the church
more the th days new campaign  communitybuilding and social solidarity shia muslims gather in dc for antiterror rally letting freedom ring how islams universal message continues to speak through imam husayn ibn ali the jews carnival purim
purim is a great religious festival in jewish religion jews have named the fourteenth and fifteenth day of adar in hebrew calendar purim and celebrate it
jews hold celebration in synagogue with reading the book esther after ceremonies children and youth wear the colorful clothes and masks and launch the carnival of joy in occupied palestine territories and jewish cities this ceremony is advertised extensively by the jewish dictatorial media
but muslims
about  million muslims from all over the world travel to mecca saudi arabia in hajj days and perform hajj but  pure mohammadi islam and alavi education is not advertised and explained properly in hajj because of the restrictive policy of saudi regime
imam reza peace be upon him stated if the beauty of islam is heard by others they all will follow wholeheartedly the prophets household inevitably
arbaeen golden opportunity
attending million of shias in arbaeen create a massive and international unity among shias 
karbala can be a symbol of unity and allegiance to imam that has the worlds effects the start of husseini magnetic attraction is in arbaeen this is the magnetic that exists in my and your heart over the centuries
so if we cant publish the shia massage efficiently in hajj we can universalize it in shia glorious presence in the husseini massive rally
in fact the hajj pilgrimage for imam hussein followers is in karbala their try between safa and marvah in the  beyn alharamain and their ihram clothes is the mourning clothes for aba abdallah
walking to shrines is topical
imam hassan askari peace be upon him mentioned that one of the real believers sign is walking to visit imam hussein in arbaeen
imam sadigh peace be upon him told to one of his followers visit imam husseins shrine and dont give it up i asked what is the reward for visiting him imam pbuh stated when you walk to visit imam hussein allah gives you a reward and removes your guilt and raises your grade
at the other time imam sadigh said if someone goes out of his home and walks to visit imam husseins shrine allah gives him a reward and removes him guilt for each step to visit aba abdallah when he reaches to shrine allah considers him among righteous favorites when his rites finish allah registers him among success when he is coming back an angel of god stays on him and tells the messenger of allah says hello and gives tidings to you that all your faults are forgiven start again your actions
walking tradition has an old history
in a way walking tradition for imam hussein in arbaien has an old history walking to visit karbala was customary at sheikh
ansarys time but it was forgotten for a long time it revives again by sheikh mirza hussein noori he walked to visit aba abdallah in  hegira for the last time
although visiting imam hussein s shrine was often difficult and pilgrims were not safe and secure but they were willing to take risks and had an audience to imam hussein in arbaeen
islamic life style
at that time with full of great interest and knowledge in the way hussein path that leads to karbala shias called each other just with hussein visitors zayer alhussein or hussein server khadem olhussein that is a symbol of islamic life style
pilgrims of this holy and spiritual journey have a lot of blessing and gifts from god such as the nice spiritual state with holy sayyed alshohada  generous dealing with pilgrims entertaining and receiving by hussein servers sacrificing and respecting for each other treating elders and sayyeds kindly and considerately visiting the imam husseins holy shrine in arbaeen
role and place of imam husseins visitors
visiting aba abdallah is a good evidence of esteeming and honoring the divine rituals and display love and friendship with prophets household according to the quranic verse of mavaddat
imam husseins holy shrine visitors enter into heaven before all their guilt is disappeared their life will be long and god provides for them and removes their sadness and sorrow
of course if this old tradition that is established again after destruction of iraqi dictator not to be cultural pathology it will certainly have the negative effects
because every phenomenon is threatened it seems if this pilgrimage tradition becomes a primer to the cultural work it will be more effective and blessings than today",english,ahtribune.com,http://ahtribune.com/images/Mujahid_Kamran_53382.jpg,bs,Fake

dear vice chancellor kamran
salam from the east coast of canada
thank you for taking the time to address this important issue regarding professor hall like yourself we all have been stunned by the voracity of dr mahons action we used to think academics of certain reputation were above the reach of the tentacles of the establishment we all hoped that a president would not resort to such a shameless pandering to a special interest group however bnai brith is not just a special interest group it is perhaps the most vindictive organization that has ever received prominence in the west allow me to elaborate
you have correctly identified bnai brith to be behind this movement against shutting down free speech while this statement is accurate this phenomenon of targeting canadian universities and canadian society is not something that started now not too long ago it used to be branded as the hidden hand behind the hidden hand during the harper era this operation became a fullblown politically driven policy directive the legislation that dr mahon pathetically relies upon is a product of the harper era harper had an extremist rightwing background and organizations like bnai brith have channelled that extremism to accomplish their hateful agenda as early as the s i personally observed the spirit of this unholy union during my tenure as the president of muslim student association at the university of alberta although harper didnt attend that university we were not too far from the epicentre of the neoconservatism movement that was brewing in canada we fastforward  years and come upon the type of events such as professor hall travesty that are products of that time in fact a web of such operations has been in full force for sometime in every aspect of canadian lives only recently we had this court ruling against canadian security intelligence service that was illegally spying on the public this gangsterlike involvement started in  shortly after harper and the neocon came to power
this is not to say that the public is protected from such unconscionable manoeuvring under a liberal government in fact the most notorious scandals involving government and human rights have erupted during the liberal regime take for instance the case of omar khadr travesty 
more creating an antimuslim bias at a canadian university suspension of tenured professor lacks due diligence toxic mind control contaminates the public sphere irish human rights activists against freedom of speech this case is something we had known albeit too late to intervene at the time and has been subsequently discredited publicly even during the harper regime  the overwhelming theme was pointed out by then barely  year old omar khadr who said  you dont care about me  this is what defines the mindset of these people bent on extremism over extremism to subdue public conscience
the attack on professor hall was particularly toxic but equally sinister attacks have taken place before some decade ago now defunct canadian islamic congress faced onslaught from all sides based on planted stories and baited manoeuvring it was the largest muslim organization at a time canadian muslims became the largest religious minority one particular episode involved bnai briths planted story involving a university professor who became the target of hate crime while at the same time investigated for hate crime if it wasnt for the humane and civic behaviour of the then university president current governor general david johnston it would have become career threatening if not life threatening event of the professor top university personnel told me in private how the university faced pressure from donors that wanted that professor to disappear from the academic as well as public arena the vendetta of this sort beggars belief even today what we dont know is how many of these assaults on conscience took place and has been brewing
clearly some of the faithful memberssympathizers apply it publicly such was the case of former professor turned politician irwin cotler who routinely infected the political arena with his prejudice and bias imported from the academia then there are others such as alan rock of university of ottawa that implanted manoeuvring of the political arena to the academia a third group would be lorna marsden of york university that abused authority to run a vindictive agenda yet others have found every other way possible to target a person of conscience all the meanwhile covering up all trails so the victim cannot point a finger to the attacker and has no recourse to justice or self defence it doesnt matter which category they belong to they all produce scandals and drag down the good name of the academia while agencies that are supposed to be uphold the rights and dignity of the academia stand by and for some cases join in to the atrocity this obscene attack on human rights and academic decency was once brought to light by late professor david noble who ended up suing york university and canadian jewish congress jointly for conspiring against him professor noble a jew himself faced the vilest of subjugation by organizations claiming to promote the rights of jews that wasnt enough dr noble had to take on human rights commission and other agencies that stood by either in complicity or in collusion with the university authority professor noble passed away before the lawsuit could see a day in court but soon university of ottawa would come in the picture with the infamous involvement of alan rock a man without a phd that was at the helm of the university mr rock recently left the universitybut not before leaving the universitys good name in the sewerage of politicking what dr mahon has done is bring this insidious modus operandi to yet another victim
had i not have the misfortune of being on the wrong side of this modus operandi in the last  years i would almost not understand what is at works here in old days such tactic would be unheardof in a university certainly such things couldnt happen in a civilized country i would exclaim
so what happened to professor hall is not new what is new is the waking up of the general public your letter reverberates the emotion of everyone with conscience that came to know about professor hall people are waking up and are beginning to ask for justice for instance in the context of csis an activist jim comeau wrote i would say its time to jail the highest ranking csis to send a clear message to the rest of them do something illegal straight to prison they damn well knew what they were doing was illegal
the peoples revulsion to such atrocious maligning of people of conscience was summed up in recent letter of julian assange who wrote on us general election day november  
yet some weeks ago in a tactic reminiscent of senator mccarthy and the red scare wikileaks green party candidate stein glenn greenwald and clintons main opponent were painted with a broad red brush the clinton campaign when they were not spreading obvious untruths pointed to unnamed sources or to speculative and vague statements from the intelligence community to suggest a nefarious allegiance with russia the campaign was unable to invoke evidence about our publicationsbecause none exists
in the end those who have attempted to malign our groundbreaking work over the past four months seek to inhibit public understanding perhaps because it is embarrassing to them  a reason for censorship the first amendment cannot tolerate only unsuccessfully do they try to claim that our publications are inaccurate
of course recent events have allowed us to see this in the highest level of politics in the united states
to anyone with an iota of conscience there is no mystery here people are making their voice clearly known in the words of claire lanyado i prefer unpredictable to criminal and evil the problem is when a president of university for whatever reason decides to use his position to serve the special interest group deliberately there is no recourse for a professor to fight himher in other cases if such atrocity were launched against a student eg the case of freemanmaloy vs lorna marsden of york university  the student an antizionist jew could bring a lawsuit of misfeasance in public office with the help of yet another jewish lawyer peter rosenthal who himself is a university professor of mathematics it was struck down by the court and then it was overruled by the court of appeals at the end the university settled and dr marsden the embattled president was gone the morale of this story is the path to justice is steep but for a professor the path to justice is becoming impossible
the irony is that it is the people harboring so much hate who tell others that they are committing hate crimes just because they dare speak out against an atrocity of course they pick their targets that are perceived as weak and vulnerable and they attack the target only after making sure that the target cannot run to anyone for justice
thats how extremism works

halls suspension reminds me of the famous cases of two american academics steven salaita and norman finkelstein both were openly critical of zionism and spoke against the marginalization and persecution of the indigenous arab populations of the occupied territories both were ostracized publicly for their vocal support of palestinian rights and lost their jobs
i adjure the not to take a page out of the american playbook by punishing academics who dare to speak up for the marginalized peoples of the world please live up to the values of the wiser more ethical and socially conscientious northern neighbour you have always represented for americans like myself

will likely argue that another social media platform is hardly revolutionary  especially if we consider how many apps are already available this one particular product defiantly taps into a religious movement and expression wahhabist saudi arabia has worked to silence
what in the world am i talking about
i am referring to resistance  more particularly social resistance through the affirmation of islams most sacred and universal principle justice
more why muslims hold the biggest human gathering under the threat of isis in iraq the th days new campaign  communitybuilding and social solidarity shia muslims gather in dc for antiterror rally letting freedom ring how islams universal message continues to speak through imam husayn ibn ali if islam has often been portrayed as the religion of peace i would personally argue that islam promotes in fact justice  this innate yearning we all share beyond the many labels we have chosen for ourselves at the heart of most
it is our refusal to bow to tyranny and accept oppression which prompted communities of man to rise against the establishment and from the ashes of empires dream themselves free
today such principles have been packaged into an app  several lines of coding put together to defy saudi arabias radical construct a tool to break free from the shackles of religious oppression
who said technology could not be revolutionary
here is where messenger  really promises to break the social sound barrier  beyond a simple exercise in technological entrepreneurship and an imperious need to reject theofascism messenger  carries the very essence of islams tradition in it name arbaeen
arbaeen means  in arabic a reference to the mourning of imam hussain ibn ali the grandson of the prophet muhammad and third imam of islam
a symbol of fortitude courage and exceptional piety imam hussains name has long echoed of islams most brilliant principles  that before tyranny none should relent that even in the most suffocating of darkness it is truth which must be spoken beyond selfinterest and beyond all fears
it is those principles messenger  ambition to promote by speaking freedom in a region locked in oppression  all thanks to saudi arabias desire to project hatred onto a faith it has proclaimed ownership over
should you have missed the momentous act of resistance this one app represents i would like to remind you that saudi arabia still forbids women to drive  that and a few other wonderful vapid social restrictions in a region where being a religious minority often equates to a death sentence thinking freedom is a revolutionary act  never mind speaking tolerance and acceptance
with less than a fortnight to go before arbaeen just as millions are making their way to karbala to remember the martyrdom of their imam he who was claimed by the forefather of terror yazid ibn muawiyah messenger  is preparing its grand launch
haidar attouq a member of the board of developers who refers to himself as a saudi citizen explained how messenger  aims to reform the way muslims think communication by fostering tolerance and peaceful exchange

    donald trump speaking at the  conservative political action conference cpac in national harbor maryland credit gage skidmore  flickr
trumps victory was a shock to most especially given the broad support hillary clinton received from the forces of wall street although trump is a billionaire himself his criticism of free trade agreements and us policy toward russia angered a broad section of the ruling class it is the ruling class in control of the banks military institutions and corporate boardrooms that usually determine elections in the united states trumps victory is a product of the ruling systems decline and crisis more than anything else the question is now what
what is urgently needed is a deep investigation of all aspects and contradictions of the trump moment first trump won because the capitalist system is in crisis the laws of the system have inevitably led to such a level of concentration that profit accumulation has turned into its opposite technological innovation has permanently replaced a large section of labor in the us creating the deindustrialized terrain trump spoke so much about in his campaign at the end of the day the profits that wall street speculated into the ground ultimately came from the compulsion to increase buying power with large debt schemes that could never be paid back by a working class whose wages have been in decline for over three decades 
so when hillary clinton decided to campaign as some sort of united front against fascism few listened many people in the us saw clinton as an extension of the ruling establishment that had pummeled working class people into the ground the black lives matter movement exposed her complicity in the crime legislation that led to the vast expansion of the black prisoner population during her husbands rule hillary clinton then made the mistake of coalescing with the ruling establishments of both parties in hopes of isolating trump when in fact she merely exposed her role as a loyal servant of power
some have claimed that since clinton won the popular vote she was the rightful winner regardless of her flaws others have argued that the republican party rightwing elites rigged the election  however true there will be no recall this time around why the dnc and the clinton campaign rigged the primaries in order to defeat sanders in a stunning shift of political legitimacy the democratic party has eviscerated all difference between itself and its republican party counterparts
numerous pieces have been written about the dangers of the cabinet trump will select indeed trumps possibilities do not deviate from the standard republican party makeup his potential choices for top positions include tough on crime rudy giuliani austerity magnate chris christie and privatization enthusiast newt gingrich however for the first time in a long time the president of the united states is accountable to something other than the ruling class in the past republican party and democratic party presidents dutifully served its paymasters while using manipulation to ensure that their respective bases were effectively neutralized
more defeating white liberalism in the age of trump brian cloughley the greatest achievement of mr trump would be engage in positive discussions with russia and china arise president trump or why its not the end of the world as we know it this is not the case with trump just a month ago trump was the least desired choice of the ruling class  it was trumps petty bourgeois and working class base of white america that propelled him to victory it is clear that the need to politically survive in hostile waters will compel trump to choose a neocon administration but a neocon agenda is exactly what his supporters voted against even those who directly or indirectly ascribe to white american nationalism are sick of endless war and austerity however nothing less can be expected from the likes of chris christie and newt gingrich
the contradictions of the trump era will breed a social confrontation between classes not seen since the great depression white liberals and white nationalists will battle for the soul of the twoparty system the neocon establishment will have to confront trumps foreign and economic policy campaign rhetoric much of which is in direct antagonism with the gops record and the democratic party will attempt to use the age of trump as a time to regroup and steer the forces of resistance back into its camp
how should the forces of resistance position themselves under this new set of conditions first the antiwar left needs to confront trumps foreign policy head on and place pressure on him to make good on his promises to scale back nato and its escalation toward russia the left needs to resist any and all attempts by trump to make good on some of his less savory proposals such as a the deportation of the million immigrants and the expansion of the us nuclear arsenal of course trumps rhetoric must be placed in its proper context it was the obama administration that signed a one trillion dollar agreement to modernize the us nuclear arsenal and deported nearly three million immigrants in eight years a number unseen in us history this means resistance to the trump administrations use of the apparatus that obama and the democrats built should be directed at the entire ruling class not just one of the two parties that represent it
the vast majority of people simply cannot afford the resurrection of the twoparty system as don debar of cpr news has made clear the check of white supremacy simply doesnt pay the same dividends anymore while the wealth gap between white america and black american would take over two centuries to even out  it is also true that merely ten percent white america owns almost all wealth in the us  capitalisms crisis has forced a large segment of the population to live under working class conditions a unique opportunity exists to build and strengthen a radical left agenda in the us and a start a discussion of what it will take to implement it
what is meant by opportunity is that a narrow outlook on this moment will breed narrow results it should be imperative that the left force trumps hand on foreign policy it should demand that trump use his executive powers to force through a st century glasssteagall act and create a federal jobs program to rebuild infrastructure in the us the left should not hesitate to condemn and protest whatever white supremacist and repressive policies come out of his administration with full recognition that it was democratic and republican party consensus that got us here as emotions run high and fear captures a number of people completely disenchanted with the current political climate in the united states the time has come to spend the time and effort necessary to prepare the people for the war that existed long before trump class war",english,ahtribune.com,http://ahtribune.com/images/media/40_Messenger_37059.png,bs,Fake

the last such pause was declared on monday when the army gave a hour lone ultimatum to the jeish alfatah coalition of terrorist groups to leave the flash point city the deadline was not met by the militants though
defense experts believe that the blitzkrieg is the first part of the longawaited army operations in eastern aleppo to take back the entire city aleppo is halved into the governmentruled west and militantheld east the militants rejected a guaranteed exit to relocate to idlib or other militantruled territories in the hope that over  fresh forces would penetrate the city through the southwestern front to lift the armys severalmonthlong siege on eastern aleppo

shortly after hillary clintons crushing defeat the media came up with another spin zuckerberg and facebook were held responsible for her debacle what crap facebook apparently carried fake news didnt the media invent and promote precisely this kind of news to bounce hillary over the last hurdle its convenient for media whores to blame everybody except themselves and hillarys corrupt campaign organization for her defeat clinton labeled ordinary americans deplorables displaying her contempt for half of the population hillary clinton was favorite puppet of the establishment she was the embodiment of a hopelessly corrupt political system and the american people realized it despite massive attempts by media presstitutes to sell her image an estimated  per cent of media outlets beat the drums for her and for her husbands corrupt clinton foundation
the real reason behind the attempt to blame zuckerbergs facebook is that it makes everyone and no one responsible what is posted on facebook can no longer be controlled by the media and the political class they lost control of public opinion established methods of mindcontrol do not work any longer the fawning media report only what they are fed by government spindoctors it is more comfortable for them to act like the mouthpieces of their masters this holds true for us media as well of the media class in the european vassal states german media were for example as manipulative as those in the united states they celebrated president obama as the embodiment of good america ignoring that he waged wars during his entire presidency incarcerated several whistleblowers and signed off extralegal executions but he possessed a great advantage he was black or if you wish nonwhite obama was thus a nonwhite and smarter version of george w bush
when mark zuckerberg visited berlin in february  he was bootlicked by the german political and media class the springer group the most outspoken mouthpiece of us interests us in germany awarded him the axel springer award of greater political relevance was the dinner meeting between zuckerberg and chancellor angela merkel who tried to convince him to apply himself with more determination against socalled hatespeech on the internet the merkel regime considers that freedom of speech hurts her policy merkels minister of justice heiko maas has established some sort of a private internet police that hunts the web for hate speech whatever that means
there is no agreed upon definition what hate speech implies hence the meaning can be volatile or arbitrarily the range of hate speech can range from antimuslim rhetoric via personal insults and threats to a call to kill every jewish zionist there is a duty of government under the international convention for the abolition of all forms of racial discrimination to prohibit the dissemination of racial propaganda ergo there exists a legal and ethical basis for prohibiting certain forms of hate speech
even restrictions to free speech extend to other spheres such as prohibition of deceitful advertising slandering other people and in some countries advertising tobacco and alcohol is forbidden in iceland human rights law accepts the right of governments to restrict freedom of speech in order to protect other social values there is a great deal of jurisprudence regarding the question who to weigh this right against other rights
in germany this body of private detectives includes civil society groups such as klicksafede jugendschutznet gesicht zeigen show your face to name a few the most eminent of these is the amadeu antonio foundation run by a former stasi agent by the name of anetta kahane who claims to fight racism antisemitism and xenophobia today she and her organization are at the forefront of criticizing people who dare to criticize the excesses of merkels policy of government failure
internet giants such as facebook google and youtube and twitter also participated voluntarily in this constitutive meeting in which this kind of internet watchdog was set up in september  this new censorship body was established in the german ministry of justice and works since then without legal basis the participants agreed on best practices in handling hate messages there are no publically known criteria according to which one can recognize hate speach that means that this censorship body makes it decisions arbitrarily there are no rules or statutory provisions those whose messages are blocked have thus no legal recourse against such censorship despite such arbitrary practice the interim results which were presented in the ministry of justice on  september  were not satisfactory google and youtube and facebook representatives participated in the presentation of the results from august to september  punishable contents were reported that were deleted by the companies nevertheless the ministry of justice was not satisfied
thus it is not only the american political class which is blaming facebook for the defeat of its minion hillary clinton but also the german political class and its compliant media that intend to crack down on facebook fearing that ordinary people could endanger merkels quest for a renewed mandate as chancellor but what appears more important is their desperate attempt to control public opinion because the deplorables ie the mass of ordinary people do not anymore wish to be bamboozled by half a dozen editorsinchief the attempt to free themselves from such control has to be crushed with the help of facebook and google
at the beginning zuckerberg rejected the ridiculous accusations of being responsible for clintons defeat after a while it appears that he has accepted to do the dirty work for the censors and caved in on friday november   zuckerberg wrote on facebook that the amount of misinformation is relatively small nonetheless there is much work ahead on our roadmap the following work in progress was outlined by him
a stronger detection system the most important thing we can do is to improve our ability to classify misinformation this means better technical systems to detect what people will flag as false before they do it themselves
 easy reporting making it much easier for people to report stories as fake will help us catch more misinformation faster
 third party verification there are many respected fact checking organizations and while we have reached out to some we plan to learn from many more
 warnings we are exploring labeling stories that have been flagged as false by third parties or our community and showing warnings when people read or share them
 related articles quality we are raising the bar for stories that appear in related articles under links in news feed
 disrupting fake news economics a lot of misinformation is driven by financially motivated spam were looking into disrupting the economics with ads policies like the one we announced earlier this week and better ad farm detection
 listening we will continue to work with journalists and others in the news industry to get their input in particular to better understand their fact checking systems and learn from them
apparently zuckerberg understands the importance of the issue i beg to differ the issue is not about fake news it is about universal freedom of speech that poses a threat to the mindcontrol industry owned by a few families on both sides of the atlantic ocean if they lose this control of public opinion they rightly fear to lose in the long run their privileges
dear mr zuckerberg take courage and do not interfere with ordinary folks speaking their minds despite the pressure and intimidation by the political and media class
when one discusses freedom of expression and the role of facebook one point needs special scrutiny namely the private character of this entity the private character of an entity precludes transparency citizens and users do not possess any rights to inspect the finances let alone participate in determining facebook projects and policies as a citizen one cannot accept that one unelected person however nice he may be could determine the projects and policies of an entity that is now serving billions of human beings such a structure just cries for corruption and arbitrary rule one can see this operating within wikipedia where doctrinaires exert control over subjects of social science such as the circumstances of  or the israelpalestinian conflict its impossible to even insert critical question because they dont pass the censorship of certain guardians of mind control google is another such leviathan that cries for public and transparent ownership how such public ownership of a global corporation is to be accomplished is a question that begs for an answer the first step would certainly be for civil society without influence from the corporate world to get together and consider a more democratic and transparent structure for such global services it would be wise for civil society to get going before corporations will establish fake democratic forums to preempt this goal",english,ahtribune.com,http://ahtribune.com/images/media/Arbaeen_2016_374aa.jpg,bs,Fake

ayatollah khamenei has stated that genuine freedom of thought will help the country to progress in the absence of a free intellectual atmosphere there can be no opportunity for growth how do you as a professor perceive it
i reflected very selfconsciously on the prospects of contributing to the progress of my country canada when i opted in the mid to late s to go to graduate school at the university of toronto with the great canadian historian jms careless as my phd supervisor i made a commitment to study the history of colonial relations with the first nations of canada my course of study took me in  to my first appointment in the native studies department at the university of sudbury the university of sudbury was in those years a jesuitrun entity it formed the institutional seed from which the secular laurentian university would emerge in the decades prior to my appointment there
for the next two decades i was able to work from my academic bases in sudbury and then in lethbridge alberta beginning in  at the invitation of the leroy little bear the chair of the department of native american studies i thus moved to the resourcerich province of alberta once again i was motivated to make the transition in my professional work with the hope my i could contribute constructively to the progress of our country from an academic base in western canada
in my years as a young professor i took an active part in four first nationsfirst ministers conferences that took place in ottawa between  and  the purpose of these conferences was to negotiate a constitutional amendment to give greater definition to the phrase  the existing aboriginal and treaty rights of the aboriginal peoples of canada are hereby recognized and affirmed section  constitution act  
more the bnai brith and the history of the mounting assault on academic freedom in canadian universities creating an antimuslim bias at a canadian university suspension of tenured professor lacks due diligence toxic mind control contaminates the public sphere section  was part of the text of the instrument facilitating the movement of authority over canadas constitutional structure from the british imperial mother country to the domestic institutions of canadian federalism
the culmination of my contributions to the formulation of a madeincanada version of the canadian constitution involved my opposition between  and  to what became known as the meech lake accord if this political deal between canadas first ministers had become constitutional law the first nations of canada would have been excluded from a very powerful legal definition of canadas fundamental characteristic
in academic essays in the mainstream media and in presentations to various legislative committees i contributed to public awareness of the negative implications of the meech lake accord for fairminded canadians supportive of existing aboriginal and treaty rights more specifically i contributed to the strength of the platform from which an ojicree parliamentarian by the name of elijah harper used his veto power in the manitoba legislature to block the ratification of the meech lake accord because of elijah harpers actions the meech lake accord did not become part of canadas supreme law
i was able to contribute to discourse crucial to the progress of canada until about the year  between  and  i had to adjust my work away from the activities of the department of native american studies towards a field of my own making globalization studies i prepared two academic volumes to lay the academic foundation and methodological framework for my transition to a new academic role the core focus of my emphasis on globalization studies was indigenous peoples in encounter with colonialism globally from  until the present
it is in this context and with the encouragement of my very accomplished student joshua blakeney that i began to shift focus towards the treatment of palestinian and other arab peoples in the region of greater israel eretz israel it was joshua who also led me to my first interactions with iranian journalists resulting in my participation in the new horizon conference of the autumn of  as i have described in writing elsewhere this episode proved to make a major positive impact on me
due to the intervention of my colleague the mohawk activist splitting the sky i also began to see the events of  as a major factor in the shaping of the global geopolitics in the twentyfirst century
my quest for new academic turf at the has sometimes been bumpy and contested certainly many major obstacles were put in the way of my promotion to full professor eventually my academic peers were allowed to make their input into the promotion process apart from the artificial blockages thrown up by my university administration in  after what i took to be my obtaining a position of intellectual and professional security as a senior faculty member i resolved that henceforth i would pursue difficult lines of research and publication i made this decision with an understanding that less secure younger colleagues might eschew such a course of action
i have made no secret of the fact that i see the recent surrender of the high ground of academic freedom by the members of the administration of the as an indicator that canada is on a downwards spiral it seems to me there is a move a foot to sabotage the intellectual freedom of our universities if academic freedom is not to be respected in institutions of supposedly higher learning then there can be no basis for freedom of speech in environments not subject to the protections of tenure
the first to suffer the crackdown in universities will be our students they will have to deal with the fact that the treatment visited on me indicates it has become dangerous to ask pointed questions which might produce answers embarrassing to power our country canada cannot progress to higher levels of discourse and achievement under these repressive conditions
ayatollah khamenei believes exchanging viewpoints and opinions are in the nature of academic work how is this principle practiced at lethbridge university
i agree that exchanging viewpoints and opinions is a central aspect of academic work within universities and between universities i found that there was a good deal of openness to the exchange of information and ideas with colleagues media and public officials in the years between  and  when the core of my academic work revolved around the history of canadafirst nations relations
unfortunately i would have to say that the obstacles to the exchange of information and ideas began to mount significantly after  when i began to question the official narrative of what happened on  who really did what to whom during the initiating events of what soon became known as the global war on terror as i began to become skeptical of the official narrative i noticed more and more inclination on the part of colleagues to distance themselves from the subjects that captured my professional interest to put it bluntly i suppose it became clear to me that for a number of reasons it was not a good career move for younger colleagues to show interest in the subject of  specifically and false flag terrorism more generally
as i began to look more deeply into the existing research on  i was simultaneously drawn to the subject of war crimes and international law my collaboration with splitting the sky became more intense when we went to work to organize in response to the decision of the former us president george w bush to give a talk in calgary in  as his first public engagement as theoretically a regular civilian citizen our collective action in calgary in the spring of  led to a trial that we dubbed splitting the sky versus george w bush  although i had not yet associated the lies and crimes of  with israel first protagonists i ran into my first zionist pushback for my  studies when i presented my essay should george w bush be arrested in calgary alberta to be tried for international crimes i originally presented the paper at an invited talk at the university of winnipeg
my essay eventually ended up as an exhibit in the litigation that we referred to as splitting the sky versus george w bush  our stance was that the former us president should have been arrested in canada for being a crediblyaccused war criminal we were far from alone in bringing forward evidence that bush had violated many international covenants and conventions against for instance prohibited torture not only had he arguably violated international law but it seemed the former us president had violated canadas own crimes against humanity and war crimes act  the legislation had passed through parliament with the view that canada should not become a haven for war criminals
in pursuing this line of analysis i faced my first allegations that somehow my academic inquiry was antisemitic
as i worked on this subject one that i integrated into my pedagogy it became clear to me that we have never seen anything but victors justice when it comes to the enforcement of international law against those that commit war crimes crimes against humanity crimes against the peace and crimes against democracy it seems that only those on the losing side of military conflicts are ever brought to justice those on the winning side the stronger side are invariably held to be above the law
this line of scholarly investigation did result in various channels of academic exchange opening up for me with colleagues in my own university and other universities the most fruitful collaboration to develop however was that with dr kevin barrett who had lost his academic position at the university of wisconsin for incorporating related subjects into his research and pedagogy
for sure i should not be made to feel so alone in the academy when it comes to the study of  the most transformative event of the twentyfirst century in my view the academic institutions in north america and europe have failed abysmally in the study of false flag terrorism starting with the events of  i am particularly appalled by how this failure on the part of our institutions of higher learning has contributed to the rise of islamophobia as the necessary psychological condition giving license to those promoting the invasions of muslimmajority countries
in a meeting with president rouhani and his cabinet the leader of the islamic revolution said when it comes to caricatures insulting the sanctities of islam the west suddenly becomes an advocates of freedom and the freedom of expression however when it comes to the holocaust there is no freedom of expression why do you think we witness such double standards
a gross display of double standards plagues the ethnocentric way freedom is being defined in the socalled west the psychological operations attending the we are charlie hebdo ceremonies on paris in early  epitomized the hypocrisy the whole essence of this strange event in the city of lights seemed to signal that freedom of speech and expression in the west is virtually limitless when it comes to demeaning through cartoons of prophet mohammed as well as other sacred symbols of islamic religion the other side of the same coin are the many prohibitions imposed on for instance the french comedian mbala mbala dieudonné dieudonné was barred from entering canada for his efforts to make humor of the paranoid state of affairs attending any public references to jews jewish institutions or the activities of israel these days
one of my discoveries through this period of crisis is the fact that the thought police agents in the bnai brith equate my call for open debate on the holocaust and indeed open debate on all subjects as the equivalent of socalled holocaust denial how many of my colleagues at the and in other universities have bent before the harsh intimidation how many have made themselves proponents of shutting down open debate and allowing censorship from outside the academy to regulate our research teaching and publication
there is a controversial quote from ayatollah khamenei in which he says may god curse all those who put an end to political thoughts work and endeavor in universities whats your take on that how essential do you think such a perspective is for the academia
i agree wholeheartedly with the supreme leaders observation one of the great gifts of the creator to humans is the gift of reason and rationality our application of reason and rationality to our understanding of society will inevitably contribute to political thought work and endeavor
this type of applied reason should be especially vital in the work of universities where the highest level of political conception should be able to find expression elaboration and receptiveness indeed we need to make ourselves expert in universities at making safe places for the development of political discourse god curse us in the universities if we cannot be the home for vibrant political discourse",english,ahtribune.com,http://ahtribune.com/images/media/iraqi_forces_365f0.jpg,bs,Fake
Ludwig Watzal,2016-11-21T02:00:00.000+02:00,mark zuckerberg dont get hoodwinked by media and politicians,"the iraqi city of karbala where the holy shrine of the third shia imam imam hussein is located is swarming with millions of devoted muslims both shiites and sunnis for mourning rituals marking arbaeen known as the largest religious gathering in the world  shares
   
given the mainstream medias constant sensationalized reporting on terror and muslims in the western world the utter lack of coverage of arbaeens march on sunday and monday revealed the double standard that exists in reporting on peaceful muslims
monday marked the final day of the mourning for imam hussein who was martyred in a battle with the massive army of yazid after refusing allegiance to the tyrant caliph yazid the caliph of umayyad dynasty was promoting the same type of islam as isis and wahhabist preach today
millions of marchers participated in the annual arbaeen procession in karbala the marchers are said to come from over  countries and most of them have marched all the way to karbala from other iraqi cities like najaf and baghdad in a show of devotion each year sunni muslims and followers of other religious groups such as christians join the journey to mourn the martyrdom of imam hussein
arbaeen or mourning is a shia muslim tradition to mark the anniversary of seventhcentury social justice leader imam husain arbaeen is commemorated  days after ashura the martyrdom anniversary of imam hussein as and his companions in  ad however in light of isis terror attacks globally several people took the controversial step of turning their march political in order to denounce terror in all forms
tens of thousands of muslims have been killed and displaced by isiss declared caliphate an exponentially larger number than those killed in attacks in the west
more the walk of light  arbaeen pilgrimage rises a great resistance against radicalism messenger   muslims develop technology to promote religious unity against radicalism why muslims hold the biggest human gathering under the threat of isis in iraq the th days new campaign  communitybuilding and social solidarity the occasion has found additional significance in recent years as it has become a rallying cry for the campaign against isis terrorists who have frequently targeted the pilgrims
iraqi troops have been deployed to ensure security for the pilgrims the northern and western parts of iraq have been plagued by gruesome violence ever since isis terrorists began a campaign of terror in the country in june 
the terrorist campaign however has not dissuaded pilgrims from around the world from making the journey
it is noteworthy to mention the mainstream media blackout of the millions people marched gathering in war torn iraq battling the isis as a clear sign of biased reporting",english,ahtribune.com,http://ahtribune.com/images/media/Mark_Zuckerberg_54968.jpg,bs,Fake

mohsen abdelmoumen  according to you when we see the numerous demonstrations antitrump in the united states after the election of donald trump at the presidency are we witnessing a colored revolution
wayne madsen it is classic sorosfunded color revolution soros is financing moveonorg black lives matter demos and other of his groups to turn out protesters and is even running ads in papers looking for paid drivers and protest coordinators
in your very relevant books devoted to george soros soros quantum of chaos you reveal the true face of this figure who is the spearhead of several destabilization operations in the world from where does all the power come that this criminal holds and why is he untouchable
soros is very wealthy and actually a frontman for an even more powerful and wealthy person evelyn de rothschild along with his family they are all the true puppet masters of the world
soros remains a major element in the antitrump device can trump resist him
more disrespecting the american imperial presidency trump won now what will america survive the next  years defeating white liberalism in the age of trump trump is actually now being surrounded by people who will serve in his administration who will be loyal to the sorosrothschild puppet masters and certainly not to trump
can we say that the occult world is more powerful than legal institutions
secret societies with their crazy rituals have been the bane of human existence since the time of the sanhedrin and pharisees in palestine and the dionysian cults of the nile valley and the mediterranean region
in your book  isis is us  the shocking truth behind the army of terror you detail the relations between the usa and isisdaesh what is the triggering element that has put you on this trail
trumps national security adviser retired lt gen michael flynn revealed that the us was supporting isis and then he was forced to resign my own sources in the middle east confirmed this long before flynn made his public statement and was fired as defense intelligence agency chief by obama
you mention western sahara and the involvement of the clintons in a deal with the kingdom of morocco while this case is under the authority of un arent the clintons outlaws such bonnie and clyde by supporting morocco against the sahrawi people and the uns resolutions
the clintons received at least  million from the moroccan government in return for buying their loyalty to moroccos agenda which includes permanently annexing western sahara as the southern province morocco and israel share the same policy on annexing illegallyoccupied territories
according to your diverse very interesting analysis can we assert that the world government or the false prophets of the new world order are the real decisionmakers of this world
i mentioned a few already sorosrothschild others are the bilderbergs bohemian club and the council on foreign relations and their counterparts
you know very well some american intelligence agencies like the nsa do these intelligence agencies serve the us interests or rather the oligarchys interests
the cia has always served the interests of wall street nsa now serves the interests of the global security network it leads
you were an officer in the us navy was the whistleblower you are today born after your military career or before
before i was an fbinavy whistleblower in  and helped to uncover a major pedophile ring in the us navy that reached into the reaganbush white house and was ultimately exposed in the washington times in  my whistleblowing cost me my navy career however and a subsequent series of fairly bad jobs
in the recent us election we saw the mass media bankruptcy despite their manipulations and their fake polls didnt one of the pillars of world oligarchy collapse under our eyes dont we witness a historic moment announcing the end of the new world order and its purely capitalist product globalization
 percent of major newspapers endorsed clinton many alternative news sources supported trump we are seeing a massive shift away from newspapers and corporate tv and websites to the alternative media of which waynemadsenreportcom has been prominent since its founding in 
snowden has denounced the prism program and you have denounced echelon both of which serve the interests of the worlds oligarchic caste what is known is not only the immersed part of the iceberg
what is still relatively unknown is the close cooperation between nsa and private companies like microsoft apple google facebook and major telecommunications companies it is much greater than even snowdens documents describe
the quantity and especially the quality of your reports reveal to us a world unknown by millions of human beings how all these truths have been hidden
the major media cooperates with the government in covering up news events
i advise everyone to read the wayne madsen report as well as your books and follow your various interventions in the alternative media how do you explain that we who are resisting to what i call the fascist oligarchic caste are called conspiracy theorists is this concept the only weapon of the fascist imperialists to reduce to silence all those who resist them and to reinforce the ranks of those whose who have been brainwashed
the term conspiracy theorist was developed by the cia in the mids to ridicule those who believed there was a wide government role in the assassination of president kennedy it has been used ever since to describe legitimate researchers into irancontra  and other deep state crimes
your book  the star and the sword  is one of the few to talk about intimate and opaque links between the zionist entity of israel and saudi arabia you claim that they organize false flag attacks including the  what is the origin and nature of this israelisaudi strategic alliance do you think that the jasta law will succeed or will it be countered by the zionist allies of saudi arabia do the fact that the usa and the westerners turn a blind eye on the criminal war led by the saudis to yemen isnt due to the weight of the lobby zionist
the zionistwahhabisaudi alliance goes back to ibn saud who wrote the british and zionist leaders that he did not oppose a jewish homeland in palestine so long as it did not lay claim to saudi territory on the eastern shore of the gulf of aqaba the relationship has always been close except for the time of king faisal who was conveniently shot in the face and killed by a relative
do you undergo pressure or threats in relation to the remarkable work you do if so how do you live it
i was forced to move my domicile from washington because the outgoing obama administration put pressure on some media organizations i did work for these included rt contributor agreement canceled and al jazeera america which is now defunct
the fbi entered my apartment in washington at least twice and ive had three visits by them at my new home in florida
i was informed of  personal threats in washington
i ignore all these pressures and continue to exercise the freedom of the press
are you optimistic or do you think that the satanist project of the oligarchy still has a nuisance capacity that can plunge the world into chaos
as with cockroaches which detest light the shadow figures of covert power cannot stand what is known as the disinfectant of sunshine light has always fought against darkness and will continue to do so

wikileaks has revealed some rather troubling things about hillary clinton and her staffers but perhaps the most disturbing a bizarre is the fact that john podesta is involved with satanic rituals 
no this isnt fiction and im not wearing tin foil on my head an email released by wikileaks reveals podesta was invited to a spirit cooking dinner by performance artist marina abramovic and you can rest assured that its not anything like it sounds 
i am so looking forward to the spirit cooking dinner at my place do you think you will be able to let me know if your brother is joining all my love marina an email dated june   read 
shortly after the emails which was sent to podestas brother tony was forwarded to john with the message are you in nyc thursday july  marina wants you to come to dinner 
now youre probably wondering what all the fuss is about and i seriously cant blame you so lets turn to paul joseph watson from infowars for a little background on what this spirit cooking is really all about 
spirit cooking refers to a sacrament in the religion of thelema which was founded by aleister crowley and involves an occult performance during which menstrual blood breast milk urine and sperm are used to create a painting 
according to marina abramovic if the ritual is performed in an art gallery it is merely art but if the ritual is performed privately then it represents an intimate spiritual ceremony 
the video embedded above depicts the bizarre nature of the ceremony abramovic mixes together thickly congealed blood as the recipe for the painting which is comprised of the words with a sharp knife cut deeply into the middle finger of your left hand eat the pain 
the ceremony is meant to symbolize the union between the microcosm man and the macrocosm the divine which is a representation of one of the prime maxims in hermeticism as above so below 
below is a video of abramovic conducting the satanic ritual

last week the pentagon issued a defense department directive that allows department of defense dd personnel to carry firearms and employ deadly force while performing official duties 
the defense department has been working on changing the gunfree zones on domestic military basis for several years in light of the deadly shootings at military sites in recent years 
militarycom reports that the directive also provides detailed guidance to the services for permitting soldiers sailors airmen marines and coast guard personnel to carry privately owned firearms on dod property it authorizes commanders  and aboveto grant permission to dod personnel requesting to carry a privately owned firearm concealed or open carry on dod property for a personal protection purpose not related to performance of an official duty or status 
the directive also makes clear that dod will consider further changes to grant standard authorizations for other dod personnel who are trained in the scaled use of force or who have been previously qualified to use a governmentissued firearm to carry a firearm in the performance of official duties on dod property this would allow dod with certain combat training to carry firearms without going through the additional step of making application with a commander 
kim smith at conservative tribune notes that the policy was a response to an nrabacked provision in the  national defense authorization act that required the defense department to allow more service members to carry firearms on base 
it is a good first step in that it recognizes personal protection is a valid issue for service members but there are many roadblocks in the way of making that option available nra spokeswoman jennifer baker told the washington free beacon  
those wishing to apply for permission to carry a firearm must be at least  years old and meet all federal state and local laws the directive said 
it would appear that the pentagon saw no problems with implementing a policy for which presidentelect donald trump has expressed support 
presidentelect donald trump ran on removing gunfree zones from military bases on july   breitbart news reported that trump pledged to end the gunfree scenarios for us troops by mandating that soldiers remain armed and on alert at our military bases 
the immediate institution of this directive probably left president barack obama incensed but he undoubtedly realized that there was nothing he could do to prevent its implementation in a couple of months anyway and thats good news because it works to ensure the safety of our troops which should always be a priority

Sean Brown,2016-11-04T19:14:00.000+02:00,breaking wikileaks reveals hillarys campaign chair engages in satanic rituals,"posted on october   blacks and liberals want to abolish science dan roodt american renaissance october   the south african fallist movement finds another target 
on my recent visit to stockholm for the identitarian conference some swedes and i compared notes on whose country was the most crazyliberal and antiwhite the swedes pointed to a short video recently released by an ngo that said swedes should integrate into the culture of thirdworld immigrants to form a new country 
my swedish colleagues agreed with french author renaud camus writing on free west media  he argues that whereas white populations everywhere seem determined to be replaced by thirdworlders the case of sweden is even more tragic more extreme more insane nowhere else do a people and a nation show a stronger will to suicide 
but i believe south africa is worse we have actual laws regulations and policies that require corporations universities and sports bodies to replace whites our country has become the world champion of antiwhite antiwestern ideology together with our northern neighbor zimbabwe we are to multiculturalism what pol pots shortlived democratic kampuchea was to communism its most extreme expression pol pot waged genocide against the entire middle class of cambodia in order to start a new society 
south africas ruling elite also wants a new society that will be cleansed of western influences and even the white race as robert mugabe put it during his famous  visit to soweto i dont want to see a white face 
the current upheavals at our universitiesknown absurdly as the fallist movementhave been widely reported enraged black students egged on by understanding whites have demanded that one thing after another must fall each accompanied by its own hashtag first it was rhodesmustfall the statue of cecil rhodes at the university of cape town then afrikaansmustfall blacks want to eliminate afrikaans as a language of university instruction followed by feesmustfall they want tuition fees abolished and now sciencemustfall 
in a video that has had nearly a million views a female black student at the university of cape town called for science to be scrapped saying 
if i personally were committed to decolonization science as a whole is a product of western modernity and the whole thing should be scratched off so if you want practical solutions to how to decolonize science we have to restart science fromi dont knowfrom an african perspective from our perspective from how weve experienced science for instance i have a question for all the science people there is a place in kzn called umhlabuyalingana they believe that through the magic the black magicyou call it black magic they call it witchcraftyou are able to send lightening to strike someone can you explain that scientifically because its something that happens 
the initial reaction was widespread ridicule from ordinary whites but i knew that her dismissal of western science was not taking place in a vacuum and was connected with the culturalmarxist ideas swirling through most western universities after all herbert marcuse one of the founders of cultural marxism wrote this in an essay on liberation in  at the height of us student radicalism 
this is the hippie subculture tripgrasspotacid and so on but a far more subversive universe of discourse announces itself in the language of black militants here is a systematic linguistic rebellion which smashes the ideological context in which the words are employed and defined and places them into the opposite contextnegation of the established one thus the blacks take over some of the most sublime and sublimated concepts of western civilization desublimate and redefine them p  
needless to say marcuse approved of the black take over and if he were alive today he would surely applaud what is happening in south africa not only are blacks taking over western concepts and changing them into their opposites they are taking over our institutions as well 
in universities and the mainstream media there was actually praising this young fallist i was only slightly surprised to read a piece in afrikaans entitled  sciencemustfall nie so belaglik soos dit mag klink  sciencemustfall not so ridiculous as it sounds it was written by liezel de lange the managing director of our sunday newspaper rapport  which once supported apartheid and segregation 
miss de lange first confessed ignorance because she attended the university of pretoria in the days when it still taught western ideas and culture she laments that when she studied english literature almost all our prescribed works were from britain and ireland as well as the usa i have to give my lecturers at the time credit for assigning readings from wole soyinka chinua achebe and ngugi wa thiongo most westerners no doubt have deficient educations because they have not been taught ngugi wa thiongo 
although liezel de lange did not exactly endorse the sciencemustfall idea in defense of the young fallist she evoked the mythical medieval african university of timbuktu as evidence that africas vast contributions to world learning are being ignored in fact timbuktu was a center for islamic and tuareg schools not a hub of forgotten african or black science nor are africans themselves united in wanting to preserve what is left of the medieval african university recent al qaeda activity in the region has been so destructive that the new yorker recently ran a story called  has the great library of timbuktu been lost  
i asked liezel de lange on twitter whether she was an afrocentrist but she evaded the question answering that she merely posits that not all knowledge wisdom and insight come from the west its hard to disagree with that 
miss de langes column was just a watereddown version of a more radical piece she had read on the leftwing website the daily maverick by joel modiri called  in the fall decolonisation and the rejuvenation of the academic project in south africa  
mr modiri is a black academic at unisa university of south africa which has been racially transformedmeaning that whites have been all but banished it is africas largest correspondence university naturally founded by south african whites mr modiri explained that her the fallists error proves her point he decried 
the presentation of knowledge by south african universities as predominantly the product of the west and the failure to recognize that some of the major scientific disciplines medicine physics astronomy mathematics among others have deep heritages in africa china and india     
in other words she is a victim of the false eurocentric view that science is western to begin with some american blacks have long maintained that the west stole its knowledge from africa they never explain how science could be stolen from one people by another leaving no trace behind knowledge is not like the mona lisa which cannot exist in more than one place so it is strange that the wise africans who conceived of science and culture no longer possessed it once it was stolen from them 
but we have to remember samuel huntingtons dictum in his book the clash of civilizations and the remaking of world order  culture follows power if anything this is what the rest of the world might learn from south africa whoever dominates politically will impose his culture and beliefs even if they are more primitive than those it replaces once the scientist has been politically and culturally subjugated he may have to bow down to the witchdoctor 
unfortunately it is not only pseudointellectual blacks such as mr modiri who hate the west one of the most europhobic statements in support of the black uct student came from stuart theobald a whiteliberal english south african academic who divides his time between london and johannesburg 
in the same rapport that liezel de lange edits mr theobald writes of the need to decolonize science because it has been used to justify racism and to support biological racism he continues 
we are kidding ourselves if we pretend that colonial attitudes are not still affecting the way science works today this is why a deliberate effort to decolonise science is valuable and south african universities have the opportunity to lead the charge 
he adds that we need a new paradigm in science that recognises the racism embedded in much of scientific practice and methodology and that a postcolonial science that is shorn of the straitjacket of past thinking will solve problems that now baffle us he notes the fuss made over the fallist students comments and then asks but when you see the entanglement of racism and science can you blame her 
are south african blacks and white liberals ready to ditch science in favor of the dark arts as harry potter would say if they have tooth aches or appendicitis i suspect they will submit to the humiliation of colonial science rather than look for a cure in the traditional rituals and voodoo of africa",english,americasfreedomfighters.com,http://www.americasfreedomfighters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/10959.jpg,bs,Fake
Dean James,2016-11-23T22:06:00.000+02:00,breaking trump just gave obama horrible news check out what the pentagon just did,"a lot of people in the us are suddenly identifying as white eric d knowles and linda r tropp quartz october   
many political commentators credit donald trumps rise to white voters antipathy toward racial and ethnic minorities however we believe this focus on racial resentment obscures another important aspect of racial thinking 
in a study of white americans attitudes and candidate preferences we found that trumps success reflects the rise of white identity politicsan attempt to protect the collective interests of white voters via the ballot box whereas racial prejudice refers to animosity toward other racial groups white identity reflects a sense of connection to fellow white americans 
were not the first to tie trumps candidacy to white identity politics  but our data provide some of the clearest evidence that ongoing demographic changes in the united states are increasing white racial identity white identity in turn is pushing white americans to support trump 
white identity 
when we talk about white identity were not referring to the altright fringe the white nationalist movement or others who espouse racist beliefs rather were talking about everyday white americans who perhaps for the first time are racially conscious 
snip 
nonhispanic whites are projected to become a minority in the year  this increasing diversity across the country is making whites own race harder and harder to ignore snip 
trump and white identity politics 
as whites increasingly sense that their status in society is falling  white racial identity is becoming politicized trumps promise to make america great again speaks to these anxieties by recalling a past in which white people dominated every aspect of politics and society snip 
snip 
to test our ideas about trump and white identity politics we surveyed a nationally representative sample of about  white americans the survey covered racial identities attitudes and political preferences in examining the relationship between white identity and ethnic diversity we chose to focus on an ethnic minority of particular salience in contemporary politics hispanics snip 
do whites from heavily hispanic neighborhoods show stronger white racial identity to measure identity we used a widelyused questionnaire  on a fivepoint scale participants rated their agreement with items such as being a white person is an important part of how i see myself and i feel solidarity with other white people as shown in the graph below there is a positive relationship between exposure to hispanics and white respondents sense of racial identity 
and does white identity lead to support for donald trump we examined the relationship between white identity and respondents likelihood of supporting trump for the presidency versus hillary clinton or several republican primary challengers consistent with others analyses  white identity strongly predicts a preference for trump 
whites at the high end of the racial identity scale are more than four times as likely to support trump than those at the low end of the scale perhaps thats because whites highest in racial identity are also the ones most likely to harbor negative attitudes against latinos indeed we found white identity was significantly correlated with another characteristicprejudice 
however differences in prejudice dont explain the relationship between white identity and trump support the pattern in the figure above was tested while statistically controlling for levels of antihispanic prejudice because the relationship between identity and support for trump remains strong we are confident that white identity independently predicts greater trump support 
weve seen that living close to hispanics leads whites to develop a strong sense of racial identity and that strong racial identity is associated with support for donald trump we should therefore expect that whites in heavily hispanic neighborhoods support trump more often than those in neighborhoods with fewer hispanics this prediction gains credence from work by political scientist ryan enos who finds that everyday exposure to latinos can increase support for restrictive immigration policies 
whites support for donald trump is in fact greatest in areas with a large hispanic population

how i wish it were the dodgers who took the field tuesday night in cleveland yes were all sad in los angeles that our team is now one year closer to celebrating the th anniversary of its last world series appearance but this goes beyond provincialism and wounded civil pride 
the dodgers deserved the chance to humiliate a cleveland baseball team that not only persists in identifying itself as the indians but also resurrected the laughably racist redfaced mascot chief wahoo just in time for the playoffs 
for those who havent kept up with the baseball drama heres a summary the cleveland team drew the curtain on its regularseason minstrel show in the spring having replaced chief wahoo on its caps with a vintage red c it never officially retired the offending mascot but wahoo remained confined only to uniform sleeves throughout the regular season leading reasonable people to believe that the team ownership had finally seen the light where other franchises such as the nfls washington redskins remained defiantly in the dark and was easing its fans into the postindians era 
or so we thought chief wahoo reappeared when the cleveland team began its impressive playoff run against the boston red sox and he hasnt left he remained stitched on hats and held aloft by adoring cleveland fans as the team convincingly defeated the toronto blue jays even surviving a legal attack by advocates of canadas indigenous peoples that threatened to forbid even so much as the use of the term indians while the team was on canadian soil 
snip 
its tempting to look past all this and take pity on a city thats had it as rough as cleveland the cubs championship drought has famously lasted for  baseball seasons but the cleveland team boasts a pitiable  years without a world series title beyond sports clevelands decline as an important american metropolis is arguably unmatched having tumbled from a population peak of plus in  to less than  today snip 
but cleveland hey i know some generous wonderfully caring people from that part of ohio which makes wishing for their teams brutal defeat personally difficult but being on the right side of a moral dispute isnt supposed to be easy especially when the team in question isnt the evil washington redskins and its infernal owner daniel snyder clevelands municipal misery doesnt excuse the disgraceful exalting of chief wahoo any more than white mens economic hardship makes donald trumps popularity ok

a group of asian american students is planning to protest the harvardradcliffe gilbert and sullivan players upcoming production of the mikado for how it handles the racial stereotypes that characterize traditional performances of the opera 
organized by george s qiao  the group of students had publicized their protest over various email lists describing what they consider inadequate attempts to remove the japanese stereotypes and appropriation of japanese culture that remained latent in the adapted productions storyline but later qiao said that he thought the tone of his initial concerns was unfair to the players 
i fully believe that members of the gilbert and sullivan players put their blood sweat and tears into trying to improve this staging of the production qiao said however i believe that there is still insufficient critical engagement with this plays history of japanese cultural misrepresentation 
penned in  the mikado is a comical opera set in the fictional japanese town of titipu and meant to satirically mask criticism of british political culture and bureaucracy with grossly exaggerated asian names and stereotypical cultural caricatures 
snip hoping to avoid these issues in their own production the board of the gilbert and sullivan players made some changes to the setting and script of the opera characterizing their rendition as a reimagining of the original production 
the board of the harvardradcliffe gilbert  sullivan players whose mission is to produce the full canon of gilbert and sullivans shows faced a dilemma this past january kathleen c zhou  the president of the players wrote in an oped for the crimson tuesday strike the mikado from our season and ignore one of the most problematic but wellknown gs shows or try to confront it by reimagining it and subverting authorial intent

zhou said in an interview that in rethinking the comical operas script the complete omission of all of the original productions issues was an erasure in itself in that it does not acknowledge how problematic the show has been to asians

on the pbs news hour on friday david brooks said white people are voting their gene pool wow just wow this is the same david brooks who wrote in his new york times column about a jewish woman who came up to him after a speech and knowing that he was jewish too told him that his speech was a description of how jews had taken over america which he acknowledged in the column was indeed the caseone of my jewish professors once boasted that jews earn like episcopalians but vote like puerto ricans in other words they voted their gene pool of course they eventually bought out the republican party as well which gave their gene pools vote a choice
blacks famously vote their gene pool hispanics are expected to vote their gene pool but when whites and whites alone consider their ethnic interests in voting it is something that brooks and the rest of the zio elite and their goyish lackey find deplorable 
basically less educated or high schooleducated whites are going to trump it doesnt matter what the guy does and collegeeducated going to clinton 
sometimes you get the sense that the campaign barely matters people are just going with their gene pool and whatever it is and that is one of the more depressing aspects of this race for me 
but what brooks said about the reasons for whites besides the collegeindoctrinated whites voting their gene pool was even more interesting 
we had a lot of good things over the years that were really good for america i think globalization has been really good for america i think the influx of immigrants has been really good for america feminism has been really good for america 
but there are a lot of people who used to be up in society because of those three good things are now down a lot of high schooleducated white guys and they have been displaced 
when david brooks was growing up whites make up close to  of the american population so it doesnt really make sense to say that the displacement of the bulk of the american population is good for america 
of course he did specify high schooleducated white guys well were blacks helped by globalization immigration and feminism what did that do for their employment rates crime rates illegitimacy rates etc 
and white women well maybe all they ever wanted in the first place was to have blue hair nose rings tattoos and raise cats instead of babies i guess we never asked them 
and college educated white guys well they used to go to harvard and yale now with affirmative action for blacks and hispanics competition from asians and massive jewish nepotism a white guy is lucky to get into a secondtier state school 
brooks conclusion was even more breath taking 
and shame on us for not paying attention to that and helping them out and therefore as a result what happened was they were alienated they got super cynical because they really were being shafted and so they react in an angry way 
well thats not a shock given the last  or  years of american history and so for us going forward its to not reverse the dynamism of american society and the diversity its to pay attention to the people who are being ruined by it and so this doesnt happen again 
here he admits that whites got shafted that we are being ruined by diversity but the weird thing is that line about so this doesnt happen again what is he concerned that hispanics might be jewed out of the america they inherit from whites 
the rest of his appearance was just a poetic rant against donald trump with any luck on tuesday trump will be elected president and we can make begin the process of making america america again",english,davidduke.com,https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg,hate,Real

call it the unintended revenge of doug band 
band used to be bills huma the guy that the big guy couldnt go to the bathroom without let alone perform the simplest tasks the clinton foundation was a band project the waters grew murkier but the recent email leaks revealed a rather devastating doug band memo on how he was making money for the whole infrastructure of what he called running bill clinton inc 
and band was also organizing personal income directly for clinton under the heading forprofit activity of president clinton ie bill clinton inc band wrote we have dedicated our selves to helping the president secure and engage in forprofit activitiesincluding speeches books and advisory service engagements in support of the presidents forprofit activity we also have solicited and obtained as appropriate inkind services for the president and his familyfor personal travel hospitality vacation and the like neither justin nor i are separately compensated for these activities eg we do not receive a fee for or percentage of the more than  million in forprofit activity we have personally helped to secure for president clinton to date or the  million in future contracts should he choose to continue with those engagements 
band mentions four such arrangements without naming them bill clinton was paid nearly  million to be honorary chancellor of a forprofit college laureate international universities according to reports and the familys tax returns a dubaibased firm gems education paid bill clinton more than  in  according to the tax returns band also lists a variety of speaking fees previously disclosed by the clintons including hundreds of thousands of dollars each from ubs ericsson bhp and barclays in  alone according to the clintons tax returns bill clinton earned  in speaking fees 
of course there was lots of synergy between the for profit stuff and the non profit stuff between dougs teneo interests and the entire clintonworld octopus 
we have dedicated ourselves to helping the president secure and engage in forprofit activities band wrote he also said he had sought to leverage my activities including my partner role at teneo to support and to raise funds for the foundation 
bands memo provided data showing how much money each of teneos  clients at the time had given to the clinton foundation how much they had paid bill clinton and in some cases how he or kelly had personally forged the relationships that resulted in the payments 
band wrote that teneo partners had raised in excess of  million for the foundation and  million in paid speaking fees for bill clinton he said he had secured contracts for the former president that would pay out  million over the subsequent nine years if the deals remained in place 
band also described how kelly helped expand a fruitful relationship with ubs global wealth management introducing bill clinton to a top executive at a  charity dinner in the ensuing years ubs upped its giving to the foundation signed on as a teneo client and agreed to pay bill clinton for speeches band wrote 
band was actually making the case that the entire network of the clinton foundation is completely entangled with the private financial interests of the clintons not to mention the interests of people around them 
banks and major corporations were doing business with bills toady paying bill money and donating to the clinton foundation through arrangements made by the party of the first part 
band described in the memo how he combined his work for cgi and teneo he wrote that he had used a hotel room upstairs from the  cgi gathering to meet with teneo clients he also acknowledged giving free cgi memberships to target teneo clients being cultivated as potential foundation donors memberships generally cost  a year 
teneo meanwhile named bill clinton its honorary chairman clinton had been initially tapped for a threeyear arrangement in which he would provide advice to teneo regarding geopolitical economic and social trends according to a separate june  memo that band wrote to the state department seeking ethics approval for the former presidents employment 
bill clinton was initially paid  million by teneo according to man of the world a book written with the former presidents participation by author joe conason 
and heres where it gets appropriately entertaining 
but band outlined that kelly his teneo cofounder had served simultaneously between  and  as an unpaid economic envoy to northern ireland appointed by thensecretary of state hillary clinton and as head of a separate consulting company whose clients included coke ubs and dow band wrote that the arrangement was consistent with kellys state department ethics agreement 
kellys multiple roles came together during one state department event in  when thensecretary clinton recognized dow among other companies for creating jobs in northern ireland and thanked kelly for his work on the issue 
dow became one of teneos first major clients according to bands memo dow chief executive andrew liveris had been introduced to bill clinton over a round of golf with kelly in august

the system is broken its deeply corrupted by insider politics  the situation at the center of power has reached the point of utter unaccountability insider politics function as a shadow government that needs to change restoring america requires dismantling much of the federal government not only for constitutional reasons but because its a simple matter of saving the republic 
hillary clinton headlined a major fundraiser for a political action committee shortly before the group steered nearly  to the wife of the fbi official who oversaw the clinton email investigation dailymailcom has learned 
clintons ties to the common good va  a virginia state pac run by clintons longtime friend and advisor terry mcauliffe its governor  came under scrutiny this week after the wall street journal reported that the group donated heavily to the state senate campaign of jill mccabe 
her husband andrew mccabe led the fbi investigation into clintons emails 
andrew mccabe now the deputy director of the fbi told the wall street journal that he complied with federal ethics rules and was not promoted to lead the clinton probe until months after his wifes unsuccessful state senate bid ended 
common good va was the largest single donor to jill mccabes campaign election records show giving her  between june and october of  
she was the thirdlargest recipient of money from the group which can only contribute to virginia state candidates 
her campaign also received an additional  from the democratic party of virginia a group over which mcauliffe exerts significant control combined the money made up nearly onethird of her total funding 
now mccabe a pediatrician suddenly decided to run for public office unopposed that was certainly nice of the dems to not only put a first timer unopposed but to throw piles and piles of cash at her and some of that cash was coming from a key former clinton foundation man at the center of the latest foundation scandal 
although common good va is only allowed to fund statelevel candidates many of its largest donations came from outside of virginia  including  from clinton foundation official doug band in new york  from clinton loyalist robert johnson in maryland and  from clinton megadonor stephen cloobeck in nevada 
in the following months common good va received several major donations from other close clinton associates including  from bill clintons business partner ron burkle in california and  from ready for hillarys finance committee member leonard lauder in new york

Daniel Greenfield,2016-10-27T14:09:06.081+03:00,obama used religious test to favor muslims over christians,"reprinted from spectatororg  
tom hayden the vietnam war protester and sds founder died this past weekend at age  
haydens journey was in many ways tragic born december  in the detroit suburbs he was not unlike many radical leaders a reddiaper baby his parents were irish catholics who named him after st thomas aquinas and sent him to catholic school his father was a marine who worked for chrysler and an abusive drunk haydens parents had a rocky marriage and divorced when he was a boy which affected him terribly haydens friend and exradical david horowitz observed that hayden harbored what irving howe once described as an obscure personal rage possibly from his estrangement from his father tom was indeed an angry man wrote horowitz who seemed in perpetual search of enemies 
hayden channeled that anger into a group that did much damage to america and was the antithesis of anything that thomas aquinas would have ever imagined sds students for a democratic society 
hayden will be forever young and forever a hippie in the memories of many americans the snarling activist who married hanoi jane fonda and literally wrote the script for sds hayden wrote sdss manifesto its founding port huron statement which haydens creampuff obituary in the washington post generously referred to as an expansive utopian manifesto that extolled participatory democracy as an antidote to the complacency and conformity of the eisenhower decade 
right 
haydens odd expressions of participatory democracy included another writing he scribbled an infamous june   letter wishing good fortune and victory to the north vietnamese colonels who were killing american boys in southeast asia  using the same kind of artillery that haydens sweetheart jane posed beside in her stint as a viet cong covergirl that was just one of countless disturbing actions by tom hayden at the time all of which todays leftists merrily sweep under the rug as they uphold him as a crusader for civil rights and of course social justice 
but not etched in our memory was what might have been tom haydens swan song long after his and his wifes cheerleading for the viet cong namely the document that he wrote for our president of fundamental transformation few know this but hayden was a founder of another group of destructive forces a group called progressives for obama 
the groups members came together in  coalescing around the only democratic presidential nominee in their lifetimes who was farleft enough for them to support they constituted a whos who of the s sds crowd among the nearly  formal signers to progressives for obama were mark rudd carl davidson jane fonda thorne dreyer daniel ellsberg richard flacks john mcauliff jay schaffner and more columbia university was naturally wellrepresented if not through the likes of rudd who shut down the campus in  then through current faculty such as todd gitlin a former sds president who today is professor of journalism sociology and chair of columbias doctoral program in communications 
whereas the likes of obama friends bill ayers and bernardine dohrn were thrust into the national spotlight in  by conservatives like glenn beck and sean hannity progressives for obama flew under the radar largely unnoticed even by the right 
appropriately spearheading progressives for obama was the man who had spearheaded sds tom hayden was one of the four initiators of progressives for obama along with barbara ehrenreich bill fletcher jr and danny glover 
it is no exaggeration to say that the signers list of progressives for obama resembled the roster of sdsers called to testify before congress in december  for their subversive activities aside from the likes of hayden rudd and davidson other sdsers among progressives for obama were bob pardun who was sds education secretary from  and paul buhle a professor who has recently sought to revive sds 
among these names from the insane s all were fired up in  over the unique opportunity that a fellow farleft radical one barack obama offered they saw obama as a golden chance a onceinalifetime moment and they got it on november   obama won the day and they at last won the day too 
and therein among the progressives for obama the testimony of leader tom hayden was especially revealing 
understand that after his early life establishing sds meeting with and expressing good fortune and victory to the viet cong and vigorously protesting the american system hayden went into politics professional activism and education like his erstwhile sds brethren hayden grasped the power of higher education which they have pervaded and served as a professor at pitzer college and also at obamas alma mater occidental college 
like mark rudd like bill ayers like bernardine dohrn all of them now in higher education hayden had come to view a quick revolution of the system as too daunting if not impossible he had become much more patient instead advocating a progressive evolution of slower measured change  by  he was seeking to advance the progressive cause within the established mainstream democratic party 
of course hayden once helped blow up the democratic partys national convention in  no matter the party of  was different and warmly accepted him 
hayden was ecstatic over barack obamas presidential campaign he jumped in with both feet looking to assist wherever he could with a rush of enthusiasm not seen since his days undermining america in vietnam not one to tinker around hayden got to work on a formal organization and unifying statement as he had done for sds  once again there at the creation the man who drafted sdss pivotal port huron statement got to work drafting mission statements for progressives for obama 
during the  campaign a touched hayden was moved to verse over the emergence of obama in one article titled obama and the open and unexpected future written for commondreamsorg selfdescribed as a website for breaking news  views for the progressive community hayden mused 
i didnt see him coming when i read of the young state senator with a background in community organizing who wanted to be president i was at least sentient enough to be interested when i read dreams of my father sic i was taken aback by its depth this young man apparently gave his first public speech against south african apartheid at an occidental college rally organized by students for economic democracy the student branch of the campaign for economic democracy which i chaired in  the buds of curiosity quickened 
hayden saw in obama a longawaited vehicle for economic democracy an instrument to channel an equal distribution of wealth  economic justice or redistributive change as obama himself had once put it hayden wished that win or lose the obama movement will shape progressive politics for a generation to come he also hoped that that progressive movement likewise might transform obama as well both could reinforce and shape one another 
hayden wrote that in june  when obama was elected later the following november hayden was beside himself with joy surely shocked that the american electorate had finally voted for a president that tom hayden saw as his kind of president once upon a time traditional democrats like haydens parents had shaken their heads in disgust at what tom and his pals did to their partys convention in chicago in  at what they did during the days of rage the next year at what they did at columbia during the student strike and on and on but now by  the democratic party was theirs it belonged to the s kiddies 
the former sds founder became particularly vocal in his praise for obama once the election was over during the election the goal was to organize raise money but not speak too loudly out of fear of driving away the moderates and remaining traditional democrat moms and pops who had worked in the mines and the mills who joined unions who clinged to their god and guns who prayed rosaries and filled churches who were prolife and antigay marriage with the presidency now secured hayden could open up joined by his former comrades at the takenoprisoners website of progressives for obama he began regularly sounding off against obamas critics  those opposing single payer or the public option in healthcare reform or government management of general motors  with the subtlety of a howitzer 
with the presidency won hayden and his allies were free to express themselves to demonize healthinsurance companies the financialservices industry aig the big three automakers or whatever other capitalist reptile lenins phrase stood in the way of president obamas desire for reform and mandate for change 
in the twoterm presidency of fundamental transformation under obama hayden and friends achieved many of their common dreams 
by this election cycle in  tom hayden must have been mesmerized by the revolution he and his fellow radicals had pulled off in the democratic party 
alas it was fitting that tom hayden became seriously ill his final stand during a turn for the worse at the democratic national convention in philadelphia this past summer where he was striving to ensure that the democratic party continue along the radical path of fundamental transformation that he and his allies had been unable to achieve via sds and the weather underground that path in the hands of hillary clinton is assured 
today at long last for tom hayden and friends the new democratic party and the new america is theirs he can rest in peace assured that his mission is finally being accomplished",english,frontpagemag.com,http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/10/bill-clinton-finger_2.jpg?itok=2tQdtgdI,hate,Real

obamas abstention from a un vote against the us is a new low for the most antiamerican administration in american history under obama our foreign policy has been reoriented toward damaging our own interests as much as possible but actively opposing us policy at the un is a new low 
the resolution ares is on the necessity of ending the economic commercial and financial embargo imposed by the united states of america against cuba 
it was introduced at the request of cuba back in  with a memorandum that accused america of pursuing an aggressive policy against cuba with the declared aim of imposing on it the political social and economic order which the united states authorities consider most fitting this policy has included direct military intervention the threat of nuclear annihilation the instigation and carrying out of countless acts of sabotage and plans to assassinate cuban leaders 
as obamas creepy toady ben rhodes tweeted no reason to vote to defend a failed policy we oppose 
except the failed policy is that of the united states by we rhodes means that obama and the left arent going to defend the united states in international forums when they disagree with the us 
all this is yet another reminder that the people running the country are not of the country theyre a hostile foreign ideology that sees itself as separate from the united states and does not believe it has any responsibilities toward the united states 
at the un samantha power took the antiamerican positions to applause from a un united with obama against america 
for more than  years the united states had a policy aimed at isolating the government of cuba for roughly half of those years un member states have voted overwhelmingly for a general assembly resolution that condemns the us embargo and calls for it to be ended the united states has always voted against this resolution today the united states will abstain applause thank you

butbut i thought we were trying to help people 
obamacare visionary jonathan stupidity of the american voter gruber is back when last we heard from the man with the same name as the die hard villain he was being ushered off the scene after explaining how stupid everyone was  
an architect of the federal healthcare law said last year that a lack of transparency and the stupidity of the american voter helped congress approve obamacare in a clip unearthed sunday massachusetts institute of technology professor jonathan gruber appears on a panel and discusses how the reform earned enough votes to pass 
he suggested that many lawmakers and voters didnt know what was in the law or how its financing worked and that this helped it win approval lack of transparency is a huge political advantage gruber said and basically call it the stupidity of the american voter or whatever but basically that was really really critical for the thing to pass gruber made the comment while discussing how the law was written in a tortured way to avoid a bad score from the congressional budget office he suggested that voters would have rejected obamacare if the penalties for going without health insurance were interpreted as taxes either by budget analysts or the public if cbo scored the individual mandate as taxes the bill dies gruber said 
now the gruber is back and ready to explain why the only problem with obamacare is the lack of severe beatings  
there is no sense in which the law has to be fixed the law is working as designed however it could work better and i think probably the most important thing experts would agree on is that we need a larger mandate penalty we have individuals who are essentially freeriding on the system theyre essentially waiting until they get sick and then getting health insurance the whole idea of this plan which was pioneered in massachusetts was that the individual mandate penalty would bring those people into the system and have them participate the penalty right now is probably too low and thats something i think ideally we would fix 
ideally we would penalize gruber and everyone involved in inflicting this monstrosity on the public but predictably grubers proposal is to offer up more beatings until morale improves while pretending that anyone who isnt on obamacare is just a free rider",english,frontpagemag.com,http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/10/sd_5.jpg?itok=lIQxOjuL,hate,Real
Paul Kengor,2016-10-27T12:05:00.000+03:00,tom hayden from sds and viet cong to progressives for obama,"search the left in power  clinton to obama david horowitz explains how the democrats became a leftwing party in volume vii of the black book of the american left october   richard baehr 
below is richard baehrs review of david horowitzs new book the left in power clinton to obama reprinted from american thinker with permission the book is volume  of the black book of the american left  a multivolume collection of david horowitzs conservative writings that will when completed be the most ambitious effort ever undertaken to define the left and its agenda order here  we encourage our readers to visit blackbookoftheamericanleftcom which features horowitzs introductions to volumes  of this volume series along with their tables of contents reviews and interviews with the author 
every year there is some report of the blissful ignorance of american history demonstrated by the supposedly best and brightest at elite american universities suffice it to say the collected writings of david horowitz on the american left which constitute part of a solid foundation for understanding the last half century of american politics are nowhere to be found on any college or high school reading list 
horowitzs latest book the left in power clinton to obama  is the seventh volume in his ninevolume collection the black book of the american left  this new volume provides a collection of his writings over the last quarter century focusing primarily on the lefts control in our government and culture as horowitz reveals even during the bush years conservatives were on the defense and leftists controlled the narrative as they attempted to destroy bush and his chances for reelection in  their primary mode of attack was to undermine americas efforts in iraq almost from the start of the conflict when just months earlier a majority of senate democrats and near half of house democrats had supported the president the left then destroyed bushs second term with bogus charges of racist neglect in the handling of hurricane katrina there was plenty of incompetence in the response to katrina but local and state officials  all democrats of course and many of them african american  were the principal operators on the ground during the crisis 
the immediate abandonment of support for the iraq war effort was a signal event in american history sending a message that a large part of the democratic party was not remotely concerned about the morale of our men and women fighting overseas the weak effort by some democrats to hold onto an ounce of patriotic resolve  end the war support the troops  was designed more for campaign speeches than any meaningful attempt to convey national unity for the effort underway by our armed forces so too the obsession with abu ghraib gave the lie to the democrats support our troops message as a broad brush was used to paint the incident as somehow what you would expect from our military on a routine basis 
horowitz outlines this narrative faulting the bush administration for failing to fight harder to present its story of why we went into iraq and the risks if we had done nothing regrettably the bush administration never had a chance to get a better defense of the iraq war out to the media most in the media considered the bush administration illegitimate due to its narrow victory in the  presidential contest a lie to be sure  unfortunately it is almost certainly true that the media today are far more in the bag for the left than ten or twenty years ago and work harder at pushing the lefts agenda the soft liberalism of walter cronkite has been replaced by cable and national network anchors who routinely bury stories embarrassing to their side and focus on those that can do damage to the other side during the current presidential election cycle we have seen the most prestigious media organs explain why it is necessary and appropriate for them to be biased this year it is a special time they argue because trump is in their view a unique threat to the republic 
on the other hand the media have been loath to consider the damage to the country caused by barack obama  the loss of respect abroad for americas will to fight the degradation of our military readiness the fraying of ties with allies and the near obsessive outreach to americas enemies that led to agreements such as the nuclear deal with iran best described as an abject surrender of american interests that will lead to the funding of fanatical nuclear regime about  of those supposedly sensible proisrael democrats walked the plank behind their great leader on that deal with no visible regrets to date there was simply too much political risk to oppose the first black president of their party the media were happy to parrot the administrations talking points for the nuclear deal something the manipulators crowed over at the white house 
at least in the propaganda use of abu ghraib the left was honest in revealing what it thinks about the military as horowitz outlines in article after article the left is fighting a war that most americans do not see disguising its intentions through its aggressive unceasing promotion of progressive policies to make america a better place this commitment to deception emerges horowitz reveals from the allegiance to the ideology of saul alinskys rules for radicals a formative doctrine for both barack obama and hillary clinton the progressive goal is to achieve a new society that has never been seen before in this country though it has been promised and has catastrophically failed in many places around the globe in america the left is not only unconcerned with selling their program to the public but also horowitz argues it is fearful of the result of voters knowing what it is pursuing one prime example was the admission of mit professor and obamacare architect jonathan gruber that health care law would never have made it through congress if it had been presented honestly 
the left is also busy at work making it easier for itself to win politically horowitz provides chapter and verse on the lefts efforts to rapidly change the composition of the voting pool  motor voter registration with no birth certificate required fighting every effort to combat voter fraud with charges of racism and turning the clock back even when states were willing to pay for potential voters obtaining the needed documents to register support for open borders expansion of legal immigration and amnesty and citizenship and voting rights for more than ten million already in the country illegally here the lefts mentor and financier is george soros and his buddies who have funded dozens of organizations which fight on multiple fronts every day to advance the left politically and horowitz has done a great public service by his discover the network listing of the people responsible for americas steady drift to the radical left 
the left uses the racism charge in many of the confrontations it creates of course the problems of americas inner cities all under complete control of one political party for half a century have never been of even near equal interest to the democrats as their ability to continue to win enormous majorities among inner city voters particularly african americans the left has fully endorsed the teacher unions opposition to charter schools and voucher programs though both are popular with minority group parents and children the two major teachers unions are simply too powerful a support group for the democratic party campaign cash votes and volunteers for the left to support policies that might lead to a better future for kids as opposed to continued growth in expenditures for the teachers unions and their workforce 
in the last two years the sorosfunded black lives matter movement has created a near national hysteria over the alleged systematic effort by police to kill unarmed black men between two and three dozen unarmed blacks are killed by cops each year many of them in situations where the victims were almost certainly responsible for what happened to them  michael brown in ferguson is a prime example one wonders where the news media are to report on the police shooting of unarmed whites which greatly outnumber those of unarmed blacks perhaps because there are no riots or looting these incidents have no cachet more likely they do not fit the systemic racism charge now routinely thrown around by everyone from the current president to hillary clinton 
in chicago in  months this year over  blacks mostly men have been shot and killed almost exclusively by other black men by year end over  chicagoans will have been shot one might think this was a bigger story of urban calamity and civil society breakdown than a shooting in charlotte chicagos mayor says that police have gone fetal avoiding making stops in crime ridden neighborhoods with the aclu looking over their shoulder demanding a report for every stop and activists in the neighborhoods treating the police with scorn and abuse following a bad police shooting captured on video and kept hidden from the public by chicagos mayor to protect his reelection bid rahm emanuel must also have read alinsky for he knows whose hide to protect first and foremost the victims of the police pullback in chicago baltimore st louis and other cities called the ferguson effect are many more dead black men killed in crime waves that are reminiscent of the s even the fbi director admits the ferguson effect is real when not covering for hillary clinton 
horowitz latest book is full of insights and straight talk on the goals and the mission of the left and how it has advanced its cause this last quarter century he provides the kind of arguments that keep his books from getting reviewed by the new york times and there is always a horrible slur available from the left to describe a viewpoint that counters one of its missions the left chooses to ignore the argument and uses character assassination for the people making it it argues that these are people horowitz included unworthy of serious consideration or respect 
silencing the critic or the dissident or limiting his visibility has been a long time weapon of the left so far horowitz keeps writing and america is free enough that the left though it clearly wants to cannot ban his books george soros and his family have another  billion to spend on changing america the alinsky acolytes have their mission laid out to make use of the funds and create an america where the smart bureaucrats can organize society and distribute its wealth so results are all equal and we can all sing along with the pete seeger songs as we turn away from any role overseas where of course we have primarily been an agent of evil and disinvest in defense every year 
lets hope that some of americas young will read horowitz booksand learn what their professors and teachers wont teach them",english,frontpagemag.com,http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/10/screen_shot_2012-10-29_at_3.04.49_pm_2.png?itok=vGN8KmL9,hate,Real
Daniel Greenfield,2016-10-27T21:12:14.598+03:00,obama votes against us at un,"an eyebrowraising new study from a nonpartisan research institute october   matthew vadum 
the obama administration is using billions of dollars in banking fines to fund radical leftwing activist groups that work to elect democrats according to an eyeopening new study from a nonpartisan research institute 
during eric holders term as attorney general from february  through april  a little under  billion was paid by us banks under the threat of federal lawsuits all but  million of that sum came from three big settlements bank of america citigroup and jp morgan chase 
many of the cases rest on bogus disparate impact theory which leftwing government lawyers use to make sure that banks become liable for charges of racism based upon the perceived injustice of lending disparity in certain lower income areas regardless of the reasons for the disparity 
instead of being used to help the supposed victims of these banks the money flows to leftist allies of president obama 
adding insult to injury the process by which the money snakes its way to leftwing organizations is both corrupt and unconstitutional according to the report from the government accountability institute that is called follow the money how the department of justice funds progressive activists bestselling clinton cash author and anticorruption crusader peter schweizer is gais president the full page report is available in pdf form here  
the report states 
the department of justice has curated an opaque system wherein appointed attorneys can legally extract money from the private sector and redistribute the funds to thirdparty organizations outside of the appropriations processan unprecedented and extraordinary disregard for congressional authority 
it adds these funds directed by the doj effectively replaced funding to activist nonprofits previously denied by congress 
much of the cash moves through neighborworks the nonprofit gave more than  million to the rabblerousing group neighborhood assistance corp of america naca whose leader bruce marks calls himself a bank terrorist it also gave over  million to asian americans for equality aafe an organization with communist roots and continued close ties to a very vocal north korean sympathizer 
the illgotten funds extorted from the banks also trickle down to leftwing groups such as national council of la raza nhs of chicago national urban league and operation hope 
many of the nonprofits that receive such funding spend the money to elect democrats 
catalist a george sorosfunded forprofit data analytics company specializing in leftprogressive causes along with a group called nonprofit vote mobilize these federally funded nonprofits  to get the vote out for those who tend to be reliably progressive the report states 
catalist was founded by former bill clinton aide harold ickes in  following democrats electoral wipeout in  leftwing activists believed republicans owed george w bushs reelection victory to heavy spending on voter contact technology including databases 
according to a capital research center report  
catalist boasts it was vital to president obamas  victory by its own admission over  organizations campaigns and committees used the companys services based on data that was loaded into the catalist databases and then standardized a catalist analysis of the  cycle says progressive organizations the obama campaign and federal party committees attempted to contact more than  million people this means that the progressive community attempted to contact over  of the us adult population contacts were delivered inperson over the phone by mail and over the internet 
of course leeching off others is generally how the activist left funds itself apart from oceans of cash supplied by leftwing fatcat megadonors like george soros and michael bloomberg and a galaxy of radical foundations the left derives its sustenance by ripping off taxpayers at the federal state and local levels 
the report states the evidence shows the left is using the department of justice and the power of the federal government to extract money from financial institutions for redistribution to progressive activists whose real intent is far more partisan than the housing and housing education for which they ostensibly exist 
in other words the left plays by a different set of rules than the rest of america there is no level socalled playing field in american electoral politics in a sense the system is rigged there is the parasitic left feeding at the taxpayer trough versus everybody else 
conservatives knew about this travesty already but few studies have been put together that follow the money trail for a half century the left has been using taxpayer dollars to fund efforts to advance radical subversive causes in the united states 
changes in federal social policy in the mids helped lay the groundwork for this insidious leftist astroturfing under the profoundly antisocial war on poverty the federal government has been handing out taxpayer money since  to liberal and radical socalled community organizations to help them agitate against the status quo one could say america declared war on itself and conscripted saul alinskyinspired pressure groups to do the fighting in recent decades those on the left  including groups like acorn and moneygrubbing con artists like jesse jackson sr  have also become quite adept at working outside the public sector to shake down banks and other businesses to fill their war chests 
conservative groups receive no such largesse from uncle sam and in fairness many such organizations would likely reject government funding on principle if offered it 
this sueandsettle corruption will undoubtedly continue if hillary clinton becomes president secretary of labor tom perez  no stranger to the shakedown business himself is said to be a top contender for the attorney general post in any new clinton administration perez who previously ran the dojs civil rights division is also a past president of casa de maryland a notorious advocacy group for illegal aliens funded by george soros and the late venezuelan strongman hugo chavez 
the moneyraising scam described in the gai report isnt the only way leftwing groups fill up their bank accounts 
activist groups were encouraged to agitate by the carterera community reinvestment act which enshrined in law a kind of lending protection racket banking regulators who had come under the influence of groups like acorn had the power to make trouble for banks that failed to lend enough money to borrowers in socalled underserved communities banks that paid enough  whatever that means  got left alone but banks that didnt got their legs broken 
few serious economists doubt that the mortgage market debacle and the economic collapse of  were caused by the deliberate weakening of underwriting standards carried out in the name of ending discrimination 
leftists played both sides they called banks racist and demanded more subprime lending for minorities and then when the loans went bad called the banks racist for supposedly targeting minority borrowers it was and is pure gangsterism through the magic of dysphemism the once sought after subprime lending was transformed into predatory lending 
the shaking down of lenders intensified when thentreasury secretary robert rubin presided over the clinton administrations effort to put the cra on steroids banks began to make risky subprime loans and fannie mae and freddie mac aggregated them for sale in the secondary market as mortgagebacked securities these practices made it easier for banks to give in to the demands of acorn and other groups to originate more and more doomed mortgages because they knew they could offload their highrisk debt on quasigovernmental suckers fannie and freddie which were under intense political pressure to service the subprime market 
president clinton turned the community reinvestment act a onceobscure and lightly enforced banking regulation law into one of the most powerful mandates shaping american citiesand as senate banking committee chairman phil gramm memorably put it a vast extortion scheme against the nations banks howard husock of the manhattan institute wrote in city journal  
when husock wrote in  us banks had committed nearly  trillion for innercity and lowincome mortgages and real estate development projects most of it funneled through a nationwide network of leftwing community groups intent in some cases on teaching their lowincome clients that the financial system is their enemy and implicitly that government rather than their own striving is the key to their wellbeing 
enterprising leftwing levelers never tire of dreaming up these redistribution schemes

Daniel Greenfield,2016-10-28T03:32:38.137+03:00,obamacare is great we just need to punish people for not using it,"search what will replace isis this is a war to determine whether the future will belong to the west or to islam october   daniel greenfield 
daniel greenfield a shillman journalism fellow at the freedom center is a new york writer focusing on radical islam 
before long the same administration that declared the fighting in iraq over several times will claim victory over isis the timetable for its push against the islamic state appears to have less do with the victimized christians and yazidis who have been prevented from coming here as refugees in favor of syrian muslims than with the clinton presidential campaign like obamas declarations that the wars in afghanistan and iraq were over the announcement that isis has been defeated will be premature 
it is based on a profound misunderstanding and misreading of islamic terrorism 
long before its current string of defeats isis had begun evolving into another al qaeda a multinational alliance of jihadists scattered around the world bombing mosul isnt hard but try bombing marseille brussels or london there is no doubt that the ability of isis to temporarily establish a caliphate allowed it to build a network that could carry out terror attacks from new york to miami to nice to munich but it would be dangerous to assume that losing iraq and syria will stop isis 
isis doesnt matter the idea of isis does and the idea of isis is islamic supremacism 
the organization we think of isis has transformed and rebranded countless times even now our leaders vacillate between calling it isis isil or more childishly daesh while it dubs itself the islamic state we have been fighting it in one form or another for over a decade it would be unrealistically optimistic to assume that the war will end just as this old enemy has shown its ability to strike deep in our own cities 
the bigger error though is to think that we are fighting an organization we are fighting an idea that is not to contend as obama does that we can debate it to death it is not the sort of idea that argues with words but with bullets bombs and swords but neither does it just go away if you seize a city 
al qaeda in iraq not only survived the death of zarqawi but it became even more dangerous under baghdadi it would be risky to assume that isis will die with him instead it may very well grow into a new phase of al qaeda one that ties together some of the worlds deadliest islamic terror groups into a network that is decentralized enough that it will not suffer from al qaedas leadership fatigue 
the rise of islamic terrorism has been an incremental process in which new groups learn from the mistakes of the old and supersede them if isis does recede into a localized oblivion reemerging only on occasion to suicide bomb something or someone in baghdad then a deadlier and even more effective group is likely to take its place each group will move one step closer to realizing the caliphate 
to break the cycle we must confront the idea of the caliphate at the heart of islamic terrorism 
isis is not unislamic it is ruthlessly and uncompromisingly islamic in that unlike its predecessors in the muslim brotherhood and al qaeda it makes the fewest compromises to civilizational sensibilities its goals are the same as those of every islamic political organization including those dubbed moderate it seeks to restore and enforce an islamic system in every part of the muslim world before moving on to conquer and subjugate the nonmuslim world if this were merely some fringe belief held by a tiny minority of extremists then it could be bombed to pieces in some syrian or iraqi backwater 
but its the driving force of islam thats why it wont go away no amount of appeasement will banish it 
taking in more muslim settlers pressuring israel and letting the muslim brotherhood colonize our foreign policy wont do it weve tried it and it actually makes islamic terrorism much worse 
when the announcement is made the usual suspects will pat themselves on the back for having defeated isis by mobilizing a muslim coalition but it wasnt obama who mobilized a muslim coalition the coalition such as it was mobilized them obama provided useful support to islamic state sponsors of terror such as iran and turkey assorted islamic jihadists on the ground some blatantly associated with sunni and shiite terror groups in their internal jihadist conflict with isis over who will fight us 
the allies we are aiding today will be the ones bombing us tomorrow 
and that is why claiming credit for beating isis accomplishes nothing isis is an expression of an islamic impulse encoded in the koran islamic groups differ in the tactical expression of that impulse isis was nastier and uglier than most of the islamic terror groups we had dealt with before this though even it found its boko haram affiliate in nigeria occasionally a little too much to stomach 
if isis vanishes from the world stage islamic terrorism will be easier to dismiss or so the thinking goes the islamic state was better at viral videos than the media that tried to whitewash islamic terror it was hard to ignore but a scattering of islamic terror groups around the world will be forgotten by the public 
history suggests thats wishful thinking 
islamic terrorism has shown no signs of receding growing muslim populations both at home and in muslim settlements in the west and the increase in travel and communications the infrastructure of globalism spread it from the most backward to the most advanced parts of the world wealthy and unstable muslim countries rich in oil but poor in power finance its spread through mosques and guns 
these are the ingredients that give us isis or any other combination or letters that stands for islamic terror to do anything meaningful about it we would have to reverse the decline of the west 
islam originally spread into a vacuum created by civilizational decline civilizational decline is why it is rising once again an obscure local terror group eventually turned into isis by filling a power vacuum even as obama performs another touchdown dance some other group will be making that same journey its mission will be the familiar one of replacing our civilization with its own 
until we come to terms with this civilizational struggle we will go on fighting endless wars in the sand and coping with endless terror attacks in our own cities because we have failed to recognize the nature of the enemy we are not fighting an acronym whether its isis or isil we are fighting an islamic state 
this is a war to determine whether the future will belong to the west or to islam",english,frontpagemag.com,http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/10/bc.jpg?itok=4S4NGvbL,hate,Real
Richard Baehr,2016-10-28T07:54:59.211+03:00,the left in power clinton to obama,"the splcs libelous new report on antimuslim extremists equating counterjihadists with jihadists robert spencer 
the objective of this libelous new report from the hardleft moneymaking and incitement machine the southern poverty law center splc is made plain within it before you book a spokesperson from an antimuslim extremist group or quote them in a story research their background  detailed in this indepth guide to  of the most visible antimuslim activists and consider the consequences of giving them a platform 
they wish to silence those who speak honestly about the nature and magnitude of the jihad threat blaming us for a supposed rise in islamophobia if they really want to stamp out suspicion of islam of course they will move against not us but the likes of omar mateen syed rizwan farook tashfeen malik nidal malik hasan mohammed abdulazeez dzhokhar tsarnaev and the myriad other muslims who commit violence in the name of islam and justify it by reference to islamic teachings 
the splc doesnt do that because its objective is not really to stop islamophobia at all but to create the illusion of a powerful and moneyed network of islamophobes who can only be stopped if you write a check to the splc thats what this is really all about 
in constructing this illusory edifice the splc labels me and fourteen others antimuslim extremists we are of course no more antimuslim than foes of the nazis were antigerman but note the word extremists thats the mainstream media and obama administrations term of choice for jihad terrorists in what way are we extremists has anyone on the splcs hit list and given the splcs track record of inciting violence against its targets that is exactly what it is ever blown anything or anyone up beheaded anyone boasted of our imminent conquest of any territory and the massacre of or enslavement of its people no all we have done is speak critically about jihad terror and sharia oppression the splc is trying to further the libel that we are the other side of the coin the nonmuslim bin ladens and awlakis until we commit any terror attacks or conspire with others to do so however the splcs libel is only that a libel 
its also passingly ironic that the splc list includes several people who are doubtless horrified to be in this company as they have endeavored for years to distinguish their message from that of those whom they themselves would smear as islamophobes but their temporizing and pandering didnt work they ended up on the index of prohibited thinkers anyway as will ultimately anyone who dares to note that islam just might have something to do with the acts of murder committed in its name and in accord with its teachings 
the report as a whole stands as an example of the lefts strange tendency to present true statements as if they were selfevidently false without bothering to explain why apparently the splc knows its supporters and is aware that it doesnt need to bother with troublesome things like you know facts 
the splcs hit list recurrently excoriates people for making true statements that it apparently regards as selfevidently false for example it says that ann corcoran of refugee resettlement watch accuses immigrantrun stores of illegally trafficking in food stamps this is a case that corcoran makes with evidence  evidence that the splc doesnt bother to try disproving it says that steven emerson of the investigative project on terrorism has claimed that the obama administration extensively collaborates with the muslim brotherhood that he actually has done so doesnt seem to bother them as andrew c mccarthy has noted  barack obama has spent his presidency cultivating islamists particularly from the international muslim brotherhood and its affiliates in the united states the splc also hits emerison for having asserted that europe is riddled with nogo zones regarding nogo zones here are some news articles from just the past few weeks 
germany police sick of citizens nogo zone fears 
the splc excoriates brigitte gabriel of act for america for saying that any practicing muslim who believes the word of the koran to be the word of allah  who goes to mosque and prays every friday who prays five times a day  this practicing muslim who believes in the teachings of the koran cannot be a loyal citizen of the united states yet it says nothing of course about the many teachings of the quran that contradict american constitutional principles the denial of the freedom of speech the death penalty for apostasy the devaluation of women and more how to reconcile these teachings with us citizenship the splc did not bother to explain 
the splc quotes david horowitz saying there are only a couple of degrees of separation between anybody on the left and the terrorists  and that includes people in the democratic party even those who are antiterrorist here again no refutation is offered  yet the lefts dalliance with palestinian jihad groups and overall antiamericanism make it impossible to dismiss horowitzs assertion 
frank gaffney of the center for security policy were told is gripped by paranoid fantasies about muslims destroying the west from within the splc doesnt bother to mention the explanatory memorandum on the general strategic goal for the brotherhood in north america  the captured muslim brotherhood internal document that explained that brotherhood members must understand that their work in america is a kind of grand jihad in eliminating and destroying the western civilization from within and sabotaging its miserable house by their hands and the hands of the believers so that it is eliminated and gods religion is made victorious over all other religions 
in attacking pamela geller of the american freedom defense initiative the splc descended to outright fabrications notes geller  their claim that i insist that obama is the love child of malcolm x is patently untrue the splc also states that i have spoken to a neofascist group in germany when in fact i have never even been to germany it characterizes former fbi agent john guandolos claim that cia director john brennan was a convert to islam as an outlandish accusation when in fact a us asset assigned overseas with brennan in saudi arabia when he was station chief confirmed years ago their firsthand account that brennan was indeed the target of a saudi intelligence influence operation that led to his conversion brennan has also stated publicly that he visited mecca which is impossible for a nonmuslim to do unless he is a special guest of the saudi king 
even more strangely the splc targets ayaan hirsi ali a woman who grew up as a muslim in somalia suffered genital mutilated at the hands of muslims is under death threats from muslims and lives in exile from her homeland because of muslims instead of trying to discredit her the splc should be honoring her for her stand for human rights against sharia oppression but the splc has other priorities 
of me the splc concedes that i am a real intellectual but complains that i am entirely selftaught in the study of islam an odd objection one cannot be both selftaught and a real intellectual in any case its false i am indeed mostly selftaught in the study of islam and make no secret of or apologies for it every days headlines proves me correct nonetheless the fact is that i did first read the quran and began studying islam in earnest while at the university of north carolina my claims says the splc are provably false but then only offers a number of them that are demonstrably true without any attempt to refute them 
it even says that i have referred to barack obama as the first muslim president this one epitomizes the dishonesty of the splc the quote comes from an article i wrote in  discussing how obama was not a muslim stating that his obvious affinity for islam and the muslim world could make him into our first muslim president the way bill clinton was called our first black president after eight years of obama id say i was proven correct in rather spectacular fashion 
the splc finally hits me for having even suggested that the media may be getting money to depict muslims in a positive light 
the facts are once again deeply unfortunate for the splc george soros funded a report on islamophobia on twitter and gave  to the center for american progress for a defamatory report on alleged islamophobes he also spent  for favorable coverage of the muslim migrant inundation bought favorable coverage of the iran deal  and bought islamophobia propaganda after the san bernardino jihad massacre 
but what need does the splc have of facts it knows its readers wont check up on the veracity of its claims but will accept them at face value since the splc is of the camp of the saints the enlightened and tolerant left those who are outside that camp clearly have no rights that the splc feels bound to respect",english,frontpagemag.com,http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/10/dj.jpg?itok=FOQTWxFX,hate,Real
Matthew Vadum,2016-10-28T07:54:59.346+03:00,bank fines elect democrats,"the psychopathic and insincere jihad islams natural appeal to criminals psychopaths and murderers october   
raymond ibrahim is a shillman fellow at the david horowitz freedom center 
whenever muslims engage in behavior that ostensibly contradicts islamfrom taking drugs and watching porn to killing fellow muslims islams apologists loudly proclaim aha see theyre not true muslims or in the words of cia head john brennan on the islamic state they are terrorists theyre criminals mostmanyof them are psychopathic thugs murderers who use a religious concept and masquerade and mask themselves in that religious construct 
overlooked is that many selfstyled jihadis are indeed psychopathic thugs murderers some may not even believe in allah at all yet this does not exonerate islam for its religious construct was designed to entice such men 
as usual  this traces back to the prophet muhammad after telling his followers that allah had permitted muslims four wives and limitless concubines koran  he later claimed that allah had delivered a new revelation koran  permitting him muhammad alone to marry and sleep with as many women as he wanted in response his young wife aisha quipped i feel that your lord hastens in fulfilling your wishes and desires apostates from islam regularly cite this episode as especially disenchanting them with the prophet 
but it is the concept of jihad that especially comports with those who seek to indulge their carnal appetites for whoever fights in the name of allah andor seeks to empower islamthat is jihadisterroristsis exonerated of all blame and if he dies fighting guaranteed the highest levels of paradise where more sex awaits 
thats because allah made a pact with them according to koran  allah has bought from the believers their lives and worldly goods and in return has promised them paradise they shall fight in the way of allah and shall slay and be slain rejoice then in the bargain you have struck for that is the supreme triumph muhammad elaborated lining up for battle in the path of allah jihad to empower islam is worthier than  years of worship moreover the martyr is special to allah he is forgiven from the first drop of blood that he sheds he sees his throne in paradise he will wed the aynhour supernatural celestial women designed exclusively for sexual purposes and will not know the torments of the grave and safeguards against the greater horror hell fixed atop his head will be a crown of honor a ruby that is greater than the world and all it contains and he will copulate with seventytwo aynhour 
as for those muslims who reject jihad muhammad said they will be tortured like no other sinful human for many more islamic scriptures depicting jihad as the greatest undertaking one that earns unconditional forgiveness and paradise see here  
there is no denying that the historic growth of islam is related to its carnal incentives after more than a decade of preaching in mecca muhammad had about  followers mostly relatives it was only when he became a successful warlord and caravan raider that his followers grew and multiplied so long as such fighters helped spread the banner of islam into infidel lands they were deemed good and pious muslimsregardless of their true intentions priorities or even faith 
many of the original jihadis now revered in islamic hagiography were by modern standards little more than mass killing psychotics consider khalid bin alwalid a meccan pagan he opposed muhammad for years but when the prophet seized mecca khalidlike many of muhammads foes such as his archenemy abu sufyanexpediently converted proclaimed the shahada  joined the winning team and then went ajihadingmutilating plundering raping enslaving crucifying and setting people on fire in the process but because he did so under the banner of jihad this serial killer and rapist is today one of islams most revered heroes 
the reason for this is that nowhere in islam is there talk about the condition of the jihadis heart or if hes right with god allah is not god he is not interested in hearts and minds but in fighters and swords so long as his fighters proclaim the shahada there is no god but allah and muhammad is his messengerand fight under the banner of islam they can take plunder murder and rape the infidels and if they die doing so they go to paradise 
such was the genius of muhammad in the arabian society he lived in members of ones tribe were as inviolable as nonmembers were free game to be plundered enslaved or killed with impunity muhammad took this idea and infused it with a pious rationale henceforth there would be only two tribes in the world the umma which consists of all muslims regardless of raceand the infidels who deserve to be plundered enslaved or killed with impunity for rejecting allah 
this explains why other tribalnomadic societiesturks and mongolstatars whose way of life consisted of preying on everyone outside their tribealso converted to islam and under the banner of jihad continued preying on the other the infidel but now as venerated champions of the faith 
christian europe was aware of islams true appeal from the very beginning theophanes the byzantine scholar d  wrote the following about muhammad in his chronicles he taught those who gave ear to him that the one slaying the enemyor being slain by the enemyentered into paradise see koran  and he said paradise was carnal and sensualorgies of eating drinking and women also there was a river of wine  and the women were of another sort and the duration of sex greatly prolonged and its pleasure longenduring eg koran     and all sorts of other nonsense 
centuries later st thomas aquinas d  made similar observations he muhamad seduced the people by promises of carnal pleasure to which the concupiscence of the flesh urges us his teaching also contained precepts that were in conformity with his promises and he gave free rein to carnal pleasure in all this as is not unexpected he was obeyed by carnal men as for proofs of the truth of his doctrine muhammad said that he was sent in the power of his armswhich are signs not lacking even to robbers and tyrants what is more no wise men men trained in things divine and human believed in him from the beginning those who believed in him were brutal men and desert wanderers utterly ignorant of all divine teaching through whose numbers mohammed forced others to become his followers by the violence of his arms 
there is finally another group of muslims who should not be overlooked these do not give a fig for allah nor wish to be martyred in exchange for paradise but they rely on islam to justify robbing enslaving raping and killing nonmuslims as many christian minorities in nations like pakistan and egypt will attest because their victims are just infidelsand its a sin to aid a nonmuslim against a muslim that is a nontribal member against a tribal membermuslim criminals target nonmuslim minorities precisely because they know muslim authorities will not do a thing on behalf of the victimized infidels 
in short enough of these claims that this or that jihadi is in the words of the cias brennan terrorists criminals psychopathic thugs and murderers yes they are but that doesnt change the fact that one group of them is convinced that no matter how immoral or perverse their behavior is as long as they continue fighting and dying in the name of jihad paradise is assured them and another group doesnt care a bit about the afterlife but knows that as long as they only victimize infidels no muslim will hold them accountable in both cases islam aids and abets their behavior",english,frontpagemag.com,http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/10/ds_2.jpg?itok=eeogWH7x,hate,Real
Daniel Greenfield,2016-10-28T07:54:59.950+03:00,what will replace isis,"the muslim bloc may have won the battle but did israel win the war october   ari lieberman 
by now it should be clear to all but the blindest or rabidly disingenuous that the united nations is an organization that has been coopted by the nefarious interests of muslim nations and their despotic third world allies it is an organization rife with prejudice and hypocrisy an organization that can undeniably and without equivocation be described as todays greatest purveyor of judeophobia historical revisionism and conspiracy theories this fact is best illustrated by three resolutions passed this year by united nations educational scientific and cultural organization unesco that deny the indisputable jewish nexus to the holy city 
on april  the member body voted in favor of an asinine and wholly onesided resolution that referred to jewish holy sites in jerusalem exclusively by their muslim names and designated the temple mount judaisms holiest site as a muslim holy site of worship to add insult to injury the resolution also adopted wild conspiracy theories including a claim that israel was planting jewish fake graves in other spaces of the muslim cemeteries 
unsurprisingly the resolution which was submitted by seven muslim nations passed by a wide margin with  votes in favor six against and  abstentions two nations were absent for the vote france sweden slovenia and spain shamefully supported the vile resolution 
that the resolution would pass was never in doubt given the large number of muslim and despotic third world nations that constitute the makeup of unesco but it was hoped that the resolution would fail to garner european support and israel could thus claim a moral victory france with its collaborationist past and proclivity to kowtow to the worlds despots did not disappoint and predictably voted with the rabble 
but following the vote a crack appeared in the façade of antiisrael invective so prevalent at the un it appeared that france was having a case of buyers remorse in an address to the french parliament prime minister manuel valls termed the resolution clumsy and unfortunate he then added in rather sharp and pointed terms that france will never deny the jewish presence and jewish history in jerusalem it would make no sense it is absurd to deny this history 
france is one of europes strongest advocates for the palestinians the palestinian authority and their muslim allies at unesco should have understood from valls statement that future resolutions with similar toxic content would no longer enjoy automatic european support instead of declaring victory and moving on they pressed their luck by introducing another vile resolution in october 
the october  resolution  sponsored by the usual suspects contained nearly identical language as the april resolution it condemned israel for various contrived transgressions and again severed the jewish and christian nexus to the city this time however the muslim bloc was in for a rude awakening while the resolution passed the muslim bloc was unable to garner a majority in the member body 
of the  nations that voted in favor of the resolution mexico later withdrew support lowering the final tally to   were composed of states with muslim majorities while a fifteenth nigeria is  percent muslim making passage of the resolution a forgone conclusion what was notable was the fact that this time around the resolution failed to garner a single western european concurrence other developing nations like india which had hitherto supported arabsponsored drafts also abstained israels behindthescenes political offensive aimed at exposing the lunacy of the muslim initiative was paying dividends 
following the resolutions passage the palestinians and their muslim allies suffered additional political reversals mexico  asked for a revote because it wished to withdraw support for the motion mexicos secretariat of foreign affairs said in a statement that his governments changed position reiterates the recognition that the government of mexico gives the undeniable link of the jewish people to the cultural heritage of east jerusalem 
brazil soon followed suit echoing mexicos position in a statement the brazilian government noted that it would no longer support such onesided resolutions italy which had abstained went one step further and announced that it would actively oppose such resolutions in the future prime minister matteo renzi told an italian radio station that these resolutions were incomprehensible unacceptable and wrong he added that to say that the jews have no links to jerusalem is like saying the sun creates darkness 
even unescos directorgeneral irina bokova voiced disapproval by stating that the heritage of jerusalem is indivisible and each of its communities has a right to the explicit recognition of their history and relationship with the city she later received death threats for voicing objection to the motion 
on wednesday the palestinian authority and jordan introduced a third draft resolution to unescos world heritage committee seeking to generate further political terrorism the proposed resolution once again attempted to sever the jewish nexus to the city and its holy sites the member whc body was expected to pass the resolution by consensus but in a surprise move croatia and tanzania asked for a secret ballot which infuriated the muslim bloc instead of the motion passing by consensus the vote was  in favor two opposed eight abstentions and one nation absent 
the two nations opposing were tanzania and the philippines of the  ayes seven were muslim it was a pyrrhic victory at best 
given the large number of muslim countries represented at the un and the hostility that most of these nations harbor against israel it is a virtual certainty that toxic resolutions of this nature will continue to be sponsored and passed but as evidenced by recent arab political reversals gone are the days that the palestinians can rely on automatic european and nonaligned support 
israel has been effectively reaching out to the socalled nonaligned nations and it is having a significant positive impact part of the israeli success lies in the fact that the jewish state has much to offer these nations in the fields of water technology agriculture energy counterterrorism cyber warfare and arms this outreach has translated to political dividends at the un 
nevertheless the unesco resolutions serve to highlight the noxious nature and malevolence of many un member states it also underscores the need for the united states to maintain its commitment and assurance to israel that it will never allow the un to impose terms and dictates on israel 
there have been rumors circulating that barack obama in his twilight months would seek to impose a deleterious settlement on israel utilizing the un security council the white house has remained uncharacteristically mute on the subject raising fears that there may be some merit to the speculation 
the administrations objective would be accomplished by actively supporting a proposed antiisrael resolution likely introduced by france or by choosing to abstain rather than exercising a veto in addition to betraying longstanding commitments to israel and running counter to strong bipartisan opposition the notion that the united states would throw israel under the bus and allow those who engage in despotism and blatant antisemitism to have a say on israels fate is beyond asinine hopefully the outrageous conduct exhibited at unesco steers the administration in the right direction",english,frontpagemag.com,http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/10/southern-poverty-law-center.jpg?itok=_-AuQOFE,hate,Real
Robert Spencer,2016-10-28T07:55:00.267+03:00,the splcs libelous new report on antimuslim extremists,"originally published by the jerusalem post  
in one of the immortal lines of godfather   mafia boss michael corleone discusses the fate of his brother who betrayed him with his enforcer i dont want anything to happen to him while my mother is alive corleone said 
message received the brother was murdered after their mothers funeral last week it was reported that the obama administration has delivered a message to the palestinian authority the administration has warned the pa that the us will veto any antiisrael resolution brought before the un security council before the us presidential elections on november  message received open season on israel at the security council will commence november  the palestinians are planning appropriately israel needs to plan too israels most urgent diplomatic mission today is to develop and implement a strategy that will outflank president barack obama in his final eight weeks in power lobbying the administration is pointless obama has waited eight years to exact his revenge on israel for not supporting his hostile strategically irrational policies and he has no interest in letting bygones be bygones before turning to what israel must do first we need to understand what israel can do a good place to begin is by considering what just transpired at unesco where twice in a week unesco bodies resolved to erase  years of jewish history in jerusalem and the temple mount the fight that israel waged at unesco is not the fight it needs to wage at the security council the stakes at the security council are far higher like the un general assembly unescos decisions are nonbinding declarations that have no legal or operational significance as such there is no reason to expend great resources to fight them for israel the goal of the fight at unesco is not to defeat antiisrael initiatives that is impossible given the palestinians automatic majority the purpose of the fight at unesco is to humiliate european governments that side with antisemitic initiatives and to weaken the congenitally antiisrael body itself the government achieved both of these objectives italian prime minister matteo renzis disavowal of his own governments abstention from the vote on the first resolution  like the similar position taken after the fact by the mexican government  was a diplomatic victory for israel so too the fact that unescos own secretarygeneral irina bukova felt compelled to disavow her own agencys actions by rejecting the resolutions denial of the jewish peoples ties to jerusalem was a significant victory for israel her statement was deeply damaging for unesco and its reputation finally the fact that tanzania and the philippines voted against the resolution was a testament to israels capacity to convince other governments to abandon their traditional propalestinian voting pattern the palestinians won the vote at unesco because they are more powerful diplomatically than israel they have an automatic antiisrael majority but they werent empowered by their victory to the contrary they were bloodied by it in a sign of their weakening hold on member nations the palestinians and jordanians felt compelled to send a threatening letter to the members of unescos world heritage committee lest they dare to vote against the resolution powerful players dont make threats they dont need to israels experience at unesco teaches us that there are governments that are open to counteroffers israel doesnt need to hide in americas shadow it is capable of working on its own to blunt the impact of the palestinians automatic majority and it will need to use all of its resources to fend off a usbacked assault at the security council unlike unesco the security council can pass legally binding resolutions israel needs to be prepared to bring all of its resources to bear to prevent such a resolution from being adopted against it obamas intention to abandon israel at the security council means that israel comes to this battle severely hobbled but there is one advantage to the uss betrayal over the years israels ability to trust the us to veto antiisrael resolutions at the security council was been a mixed blessing on the one hand the us has secured israel from diplomatic assaults but on the other hand our ability to trust washington has made us diplomatically lazy and ineffective safe in washingtons shadow we have behaved as through all diplomacy is public diplomacy that is we have pretended that statecraft begins and ends with making the moral or strategic case for our side against the other guys but public diplomacy is just one diplomatic tool the syrian regime for instance has no moral case for securing international support bashar assad didnt convince russian president vladimir putin to support him by arguing that he is better than alternative regimes he bought putins support by offering him permanent air and naval bases in syria then there is morocco another weak state with no public diplomacy case to make last march un secretarygeneral ban kimoon outraged rabat when he acknowledged the plain fact that western sahara which morocco occupies is occupied territory morocco quickly secured the support of spain and france and launched an allout onslaught against ban how did morocco manage moroccos most powerful diplomatic resource is its control over migration flows from north africa to europe anytime it wishes rabat can open the migratory floodgates just as easily as it can keep them shut and the french and spanish know it in less than a month ban issued repeated abject apologies game set match morocco from reports to date it appears that shortly after the us elections on november  the malaysians or egyptians will submit a palestinianbacked resolution that defines israeli communities in united jerusalem judea and samaria as illegal if the resolution is brought to a vote the us will fail to veto it such a resolution or a resolution obligating israel to withdraw to the  armistice lines would cause israel grave harm so what resources does israel have to prevent this from happening of course we have public diplomacy and that might work with some friendly nations but it wont get us over the top we need to learn from the syrian and moroccan examples and consider what we have to offer security council members in exchange for their support in scuttling the approaching onslaught against us one such resource is the us congress israels allies in congress are sickened by the obama administrations devastating middle east policies a solid majority of lawmakers can be trusted to support actions that will reinforce israels position israel has other resources as well that we can trade on we have natural gas and we have technologies that the governments of the world require to surmount the challenges of the  century there is no reason to give these resources away when we can trade them for diplomatic support as for the palestinians as the unesco vote showed they are less popular now than at any time in the past  years all they have to offer is threats and antisemitism both are powerful weapons but they are no longer invincible israels goal must be to use our resources at the security council in a manner that will make it impossible for obama to enable an antiisrael resolution to pass a method for achieving this goal has two components the first component is to convince a friendly country on the security council to propose a balanced resolution that would counter the palestinianbacked israelbashing one such a resolution could include four points first it could deplore efforts to deny jewish history in jerusalem and the temple mount second it can condemn the paplo for their continued unlawful funding of terrorists third it can urge israel to restrain settlement construction in areas that in previous negotiations have been identified as likely territory for a future palestinian state fourth it can call on israel and the pa to reinstate negotiations immediately without preconditions israel has friendly ties with a few security council members among them uruguay and new zealand in the final weeks of the obama era it is possible that israel will be able to convince one of them to submit a balanced resolution along these lines obama would be hardpressed to oppose such a resolution in favor of one that singles israel out for rebuke but that still is insufficient obama can make uruguay and new zealand a better offer if he wishes and so we move to the second aspect of the plan if we learn nothing else from the obama era we must recognize that the time has come for israel to stop sufficing with just one security council veto most states have several and we need a few more russia today is the best place to start our search for a second veto putin is a dealmaker as his agreement with assad showed he is willing to consider attractive offers obviously israel wont offer russia bases but we do have other things to offer putin in exchange for a veto for instance in exchange for a russian veto at the security council israel can offer putin to lobby the us congress to cancel us sanctions against russia over russias annexation of crimea israel has no dog in that fight and the sanctions are not getting the us anywhere putin might go for the deal for two reasons first by stepping into the breach and defending israel against obama he will humiliate obama second if israel succeeds with the congress he will reap economic rewards for his part putin wouldnt even have to openly side with israel all he would have to do is announce that in the interests of regional stability russia will not support an unbalanced resolution on israel and the palestinians if putin supports a balanced resolution obama will be checkmated his plan to take revenge on israel for not following him off the strategic cliff will be foiled israel will have survived his presidency none of this will be easy and success is far from assured there are many more ways for israel to fail than succeed our diplomatic weakness remains a millstone around our neck but as the unesco resolutions showed attacking israel is no longer cost free we are not powerless in the grip of circumstances we have cards to play and now is the time to play them for all they are worth",english,frontpagemag.com,http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/10/lp_1.jpg?itok=3ClxpnGN,hate,Real
Raymond Ibrahim,2016-10-28T07:55:00.777+03:00,the psychopathic and insincere jihad,"a look at the universitys new mission october   jack kerwick 
jonathan haidt a professor of social psychology at new york university argued in a recently published essay that while its traditional telos end or goal has been truth within the last few decades the university has assumed another social justice 
the university however can only have one telos 
the conflict between these two goals has raged for decades haidt claims last year though it became unmanageable when student groups at  universities and colleges around the country issued  demands  to administrators demands for social justice that by and large were met 
the following statement is posted at blackliberationcollectiveorg  
we demand at the minimum black students and black faculty to be reflected by the national percentage of black folk in the state and the country 
we demand free intuition for black and indigenous students 
we demand a divestment from prisons and an investment in communities 
a statement of principles follows the black liberation collective blc opposes antiblackness sexism ableism capitalism white privilege inequality and heteronormativity it rejects as well nonviolence considered as a principle in contradistinction to a tactic  
antiblack racism is woven in the fabric of our global society says the blc when social systems are racialized by white supremacy whiteness becomes the default of humanity and blackness is stripped of its humanity becoming a commodity becoming disposable 
the blc is antisexist insofar as it affirms the value of all black womens lives whether cisgender transgender or genderqueer in addition to rejecting eurocentric beauty standards that are made to lessen the beauty of black women and black womens features being antisexist also means realizing that police brutality the prison industrial system school to prison pipeline and the like are aspects of structural racism that affect black women as much as they impact black men 
black liberation entails queer liberation and trans liberation we also seek to destroy the heteronormative norms that dehumanize black queer people the blc asserts the homophobia within the black community comes by way of the same hands responsible for white supremacy 
presumably transphobia within the black community is also a legacy of white supremacy in cooperation with cissexism and the gender binary transphobia has been used as a means of invalidating and erasing our trans family members the blc pledges to eliminate such systemic biases 
these social justice warriors sjws are staunch opponents of the capitalist notions of infinite profit homogenized markets and a privatized means of production capitalism they insist is the economic system thats been used to justify the oppression marginalization and exploitation of blacks 
nor is the solution to this oppression to be found in supporting blackowned businesses the blc explains that we cannot adopt the patriarchal exploitative tools of our oppressors as we seek liberation rather the solution is to dismantle antiblack capitalist corporations that benefit from our oppression 
it isnt only the capitalist corporations that these students want destroyed they demand as well the eradication of all institutional practices and policies that discriminate against the black community and the removal of all federal state and local government officials who do not abide by our principles 
the state and all its institutions that deny black humanity and black agency must be dismantled and replaced with those that produce black liberty 
concerning its attitude toward america the blc is clear this country was built to systematically oppress groups of people and the black liberation collective will not stand for it 
haidt misspeaks in characterizing  as the year when the university experienced a crisis of identity an unmanageable conflict of goals to judge from the vast majority of liberal arts humanities and social sciences departments social justice long ago eclipsed truth as the raison detre of the academy interestingly it is these sjw demands from last year that bear this out 
perhaps it is because ive spent the last couple of decades in the academy in the capacity of both student and faculty that i may be more privy to this than are some others but its painfully obvious that these student activists did not come up with these demands on their own if they didnt have their professors actually write the demands for them then the black liberation collective unquestionably derived the concepts and language of their statement of demands from their mentors 
to put it bluntly one must attend college major in the liberal arts and humanities and study under far left professors in order to think in the terms that are characteristic of social justice warriors 
leftist ideologues are training their students to bend the university to their will this is the first point there is though another a rich irony that is lost upon these selfstyled radicals 
for all of their bluster over systemic racism and structural white supremacy ie phenomena that are omnipresent and hence largely unconscious these black students their white collaborators and their professors fail to realize that their thinking for lack of a better term on these issues is about as eurocentric as one can get the  critical race theory  to which the blc subscribe is a version of marxism the philosophical vision of a  th century germanjewish man the marxist tradition within which they are enmeshed was fleshed out over a span of generations by mostly white heterosexual men 
but theres more to it than this 
the idea that racism sexism homophobia transphobia ableism and the like against which sjws rail are evils to be defeated is itself peculiar to the moral traditions of european civilization if these isms and phobias are immoral it can only be because those who are guilty of them fail to judge the individual as an individual color gender sexual orientation ability and so forth are neither constitutive of nor essential to the moral identity of the individualbut only if the framework of the doctrine of individualism is accepted 
yet this conception of the sacrosanct individual is as eurocentric as the proverbial apple pie is american 
the social justice warriors intellectual landscape is as much a european colony as was any west african country in the  th or early  th centuries those in the black liberation collective have most definitely internalized the modes of thought of their oppressor 
now they would have been well aware of all this had they received a genuine education in college rather than a training in social justice",english,frontpagemag.com,http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/10/sw.jpg?itok=bxOjUWH-,hate,Real
Ari Lieberman,2016-10-28T07:55:01.169+03:00,the battle at unesco,"what feminists can learn from melania trump october   ilana mercer 
in recent interviews donald trumps wife melania trump observed wryly that almost every malicious liefilled article about herself or he husband was written by a  female indeed women seem to have a particular stake in bringing mr trump down 
the contrast between mrs trump and the many histrionic shrews prosecuting her husband is stark in both her interviews with cnns condescending anderson cooper and fox newss ainsley earhardt mrs trump was the embodiment of strength 
when a liberal woman declares shes a strong woman usually uttered in a tartlike staccato inflection shes using a cliché look at her actions youll see that strong to liberal distaff means kicking and screaming until she brings others into compliance with her worldview and ways 
a strong liberal woman is one who hammers you about your obligation to forkout for her trojans and her trivora and if birth control fails our liberated libertine then youre on the hook for her abortions and abortifacients and dont dare doubt any of the intemperate charges leveled by this prototype liberal succubus against a man any man to doubt her is to harm her 
it was not without significance that hillary clintons first general election speech in june was before planned parenthood at the time media buried the story of one named rajiv k fernando  who had donated to the clinton foundation and was given a seat as hillarys nuclear weapons advisor watching this i was thinking endemic corruption the  trillion debt the dire jobs report the terrifying prospect of negative interest rates and the fate of savers but hillary and her gynobrigade in media and across the country were cheering for a universal right to taxpayerpaid dilation and curettage dc 
melania trump on the other hand is authentically strong 
in her refusal to impart salacious tellall tidbits to interviewers in the way she guards her privacy and that of her family in her serene gracious and beautiful manners and bearingmrs trump exemplifies a european womans good breeding shes a class act her enemies are the cultural underclass 
nor does mrs trump display any of the histrionics about men exhibited by her american counterparts there are images on the internet of presidents being inappropriate with women in particular you can watch a grainy youtube clip of barack obama appearing to be showing off his crotch to giggling female reporters in another the president with frances nicolas sarkozy is eying the shapely behind of a young woman passing by much to media chagrin melania refused to get worked up about the  access hollywood tape in which her husband engaged in lockerroom talk 
men will be men if theyre not saying it theyre thinking it 
more material than her mien were melania trumps words of reason on the sovietstyle witchhunt launched against her husband with media mediation she said this all sexual assault allegations should be handled in a court of law to accuse someone man or woman without evidence is damaging and unfair this was the exact verdict of famed defense attorney tom mesereau about the bill cosby pileon quit the feeding frenzy give the man his due process investigate the women counseled mesereau esq at the time 
the very embodiment of the malevolent liberal matriarchy rising is the sainted michelle obama the first lady was lauded for an unhinged antitrump address to the nations women in a world where americans have been beheaded on camera women raped en masse on europes streets and christians exterminated in the middle eastthe first lady bewailed being shaken to her shallow core by raunchy words i cant stop thinking about it groaned michelle about mr trumps access hollywood indiscretion it has shaken me to my core in a way i could not have predicted 
the ritualistic decapitation on the altar of a catholic priest by muslim migrants in france thats something i cant stop thinking about the machinegunning of five macys shoppers and employees by a turkish muslim immigrant arcan cetin in my neck of the woods that has shaken me to my core in a way i could not have predicted again mrs obamas pitiful case against mr trump has strengthened nothing but her dramaqueen credentials 
candidate clinton crowed that mrs obamas long whinge for women was a compelling and strong case about the stakes in the election about who we are as americans indeed the implicit case michelle put to women is this a mammoth national debt a shrinking job market rising lawlessness and racial strife an annual intake of mostly thirdworld immigrants exceeding  million the dangers to life and limb of importing more islam fuhgeddaboudit what counts whimpered michelle obama voice tremblingyes mrs obama almost brought herself to tearswas to ferret out microaggression and find a safeplace to hunker down 
as i write sen elizabeth warren has stormed a stage somewhere for hillary clinton phony pocahontas is hollering about the power of nasty women to immiserate clinton and warren make for a resentful domineering powerhungry pair whove made it big in life through the use of state power the human backdrop to their displays of female force invariably looks the same 
whereas trump rallies are packed with hopefilled beaming faces a clintonwarren affair is festooned with malevolentlooking aggrieved women and their frightened lowt houseboys the background music enfeebled squeaking courtesy of a female pop singer like katy perry whose outoftune yelps and bedroom whispers would be unheard if not for the marvel of autotune autotune is the holy grail of recording that corrects intonation problems in vocals or solo instruments in real time without distortion or artifacts it was invented by a male engineer

Caroline Glick,2016-10-28T07:55:02.971+03:00,checkmating obama,"search zineb el rhazoui charlie hebdo survivor discusses why the world needs to destroy islamic fascism undeterred by fatwas and death threats the author has released an incendiary and thoughtful new book bound to provoke debate october   
reprinted from nytimescom 

she leads a clandestine existence on the move and under hour guard as frances most protected woman yet zineb el rhazoui the charlie hebdo journalist who happened to be in casablanca on january  last year the day terrorists avenging the prophet massacred nine people at the satirical magazine in paris believes she has a duty to defy islamists desperate to silence her 
shaken but undeterred by the fatwas and relentless precise death threats issued via social media to kill the bitch since she helped produce the publications first survivors issue following the attack  and spoke about it in arabic for the arab press  the moroccanfrench writer refuses to assume an anonymous identity fleeing paris or abandoning her human rights activism and her unforgiving critiques of the religion she grew up with are also out of the question 
i dont have the right to renounce my struggle or to give up my freedom says the reporter and sociologist of religion in an interview with women in the world during a recent trip to new york as part of french president francois hollandes delegation when he received the appeal of conscience foundations world statesman award for  if the french state protects me it is not little individual me what is being protected is my freedom to be irreverent and freedom of expression so i should exercise this even more because i enjoy this protection 
its totally crazy i have done nothing against the law and have nothing to hide yet i live with security while those who threaten us are free el rhazoui declares with an air of shock and anger that underscores the arbitrariness and brutality visited on a yearold woman condemned to living on the run and mostly in the shadows and if you call them by their names you are islamophobic and racist i am racist i can teach them a few things about arab culture i can show them how to discover its richness and the diversity of their culture i believe this culture deserves universality because you can be arab muslim and a free thinker 
resisting terror 
sweeping in to the offices of women in the world in manhattan accompanied by bodyguards the worldrenowned journalist is living proof of her pledge to keep living her life beyond its limits as a key way of resisting terror elegant and beautiful with her long wavy hair flowing freely and in an impeccably tailored black dress el rhazoui is reminiscent of s cinemas cerebral heroines  her eloquence and composure only occasionally betraying the trauma of the past  months each time we speak about the aftermath of the massacre at her magazine and how she is coping personally her voice quavers but when the subject comes back to her fight for reform in islamic civilization she is fearless 
in this spirit el rhazoui obliged to spend most of her time in hiding like salman rushdie after his  publication of the satanic verses  has taken the highrisk option of publishing an explosive new book about islam 
detruire le fascisme islamique  destroy islamic fascism  being released in france this week takes the battle of ideas directly to the ideologicallydriven zealots who inspired the assassins of her dear friend charb stephane charbonnier late editor of charlie hebdo who preferred to die standing than to live on my knees 
obtained exclusively by women in the world the book dedicated to muslim atheists is an unapologetic strike against the strict application of islam by imitating the first salafists or pious ancestors the prophet mohammed and his companions whose violent exploits are contained in bellicose texts from a barbaric thcentury bedouin tribal context exhibited codes of behavior el rhazoui insists have no place in the modern world and can be directly connected to terrorism the most abject crimes of islamic state are but a stcentury remake of what the first muslims accomplished under the guidance of the prophet she writes noting that sexual and domestic slavery the massacre of nonmuslims notably jews pedophilia pillage polygamy and summary executions were all adopted from preislamic societies the book is also the journalists way of carrying on the legacy of her dead comrades who reveled in their right to mock established religion and fanatics everywhere  with islam no exception to their traditional french anticlerical ridicule  through satire and caricature 
formerly the magazines religion writer el rhazoui is in the throes of joining the exodus of staff breaking from the magazine under its new management flush with cash from international donations the fundamentally altered publication she disappointedly explained  will probably never again draw the prophet  out of fear of more reprisals 
and those who think that only a handful of madmen are capable of killing for a cartoon of mohammed forget that everywhere that islam reigns as the religion of the state caricatures and cartoons in the press are repressed el rhazouis book dedicated to muslim atheists is an unapologetic strike against the strict application of islam religion of peace and love 
we need to admit that islamism today is applied islam el rhazoui  who describes herself as an atheist of muslim culture writes responding to politicians religious figures islamophobia opponents and media commentators who claim after every jihadist attack that real islam has nothing to do with such terror 
when we apply islam to the letter it gives islamism and when we apply islamism to the letter it gives terrorism so we need to stop saying islam is a religion of peace and love what is a moderate islamist an islamist who doesnt kill 
the essaylength book is in the grand french polemical tradition of emile zola whose jaccuse denounced the antisemitism of the french state and establishment during the dreyfus affair on the eve of the th century el rhazoui who holds moroccan and french citizenship takes aim at a very stcentury phenomenon what she abhors as the intellectual fraud of islamophobia which pretends to be about antiracism but in her reckoning is used as a weapon to silence all critics of islam and the ideas behind it as automatically hostile towards all muslims epitomized by the french collective against islamophobia ccif this deliberate strategy vilifies as islamophobic voices such as el rhazouis who dare question the religion the ccif and fellow travelers define only through the prism of their own fundamentalism 
the notion of islamophobia doesnt even exist in muslim countries the author points out because outside the west criticism of the religion or mohammed is officially categorized as blasphemy 
unable to pass blasphemy laws in europe groups like the ccif employ a dangerous semantic confusion she said on the ccif site it is written islamophobia is not an opinion it is an offense 
this is very dangerous because it has even entered the dictionary as hostility towards islam and muslims yet criticism of an idea of islam or of a religion cannot be characterized as an offense or a crime i was born and lived under the islam of morocco and live in france and i have the right criticize religion and this dictatorship of islamophobia that says i have no right to criticize if we criticize christianity it doesnt mean we are christianophobes or racist towards the christian race 
the widespread pressure to selfcensor is severe el rhazoui says 
you can no longer speak about islam without saying its a religion of peace and love but when you open any book in islam what do you find violence blood oppression of women and hate for other religions 
of course you can find this in other religions however we are talking about something written many centuries ago during a barbaric time for humanity as long as we dont talk about this and keep repeating that islam is a religion of peace and love many people will continue to believe the koran is a constitution and that rather than being a book written  centuries ago reflecting a particular context it is a legal constitution to apply today 
zineb el rhazoui feels she is carrying on the legacy of her dead charlie hebdo comrades 
after completing high school in morocco el rhazoui studied languages and the sociology of religion obtaining a masters degree from pariss prestigious social science graduate school ehess in her twenties she returned to the country of her birth to work as a journalist at le journal hebdomadaire becoming a campaigner for secular liberties such as the right to break the fast and even snack in public during the month of ramadan this act of nonviolent resistance earned her her first fatwa ahead of her involvement in the movement supporting the arab spring in  the wave of personal attacks and threats that came after her collective protest against ramadan rules prompted her to leave morocco again for france where she began to report for charlie hebdo bringing her memories of having vomited up compulsory religious classes in a country where being muslim is not a choice unless youre jewish or christian 
extreme personality cult 
socalled islamic fascism seen in its most extreme form in groups like isis shares characteristics in common with all extremeright fascisms el rhazoui argues because it combines an intense personality cult around mohammed as the incarnation of the nation it also employs widespread systems of suspicion and denunciation exemplified by sartorial branding  for example burkinis or niqabs  that allow for immediate identification and targeting of nonadherents there are also familiar fascist tropes of repressive sexism against women and homosexuals armed militias adoption of a flag and a strategy that confers the benign status of muslim women to heavily veiled adherents in the west and characterizes them disingenuously as victimized objects of exclusion 
the literary corpus of islam is so stuffed with damning accounts it would be difficult to cleanse it without altering the fundamentals of dogma el rhazoui writes 
if the terrorists of daesh isis behead those they judge to be miscreants that is because they draw on their legislation in the texts like the th surah of the koran alanfal verse  remember what your lord revealed to the angels  i am with you so support those who have believed i will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve you can strike them above the neck and strike off every fingertip 
you can be arab muslim and a free thinker 
drawing on her personal experience and scholarly knowledge of islams core arabic texts the politics of the postarab spring middle east and the wellspring of reformism and dissidence embraced within the multifaceted islamic civilization el rhazouis book is an impassioned response to all the extremists who want to see her and her fellow opponents of politicoreligious repression dead 
the greatest racism is el rhazoui argues the racism of the islamist ideology that forbids marriage with people who are not muslims and that rejects women that is the definition of racism and fascism and we must say it the writer adds 
today islam in the world only has a role as a civilization a civilization is defined by many things and not uniquely by religion  but also by its geographical heritage its artistic culinary and sartorial traditions and by literature 
the muslim religion has its place in the modern world if it submits itself fully to the laws that rule humanity today universal principles of equality between men and women sexual and individual freedom and equality for all no matter your creed or religion until islam has admitted this and accepted that the freedom of men and women is superior to it islam will not be acceptable 
islamophobia whiners 
destroy islamic fascism aims to puncture the hypocrisy and fauxintellectual fakery the authors word of islamophobia whiners and other collaborationists from across the political spectrum  particularly the hard left cryptoislamist antiracists on a quest for a new muslim proletariat certain feminists cultural relativists and socalled moderate imams all these willing accomplices do is distort the noble cause of fighting racism to give undeserved legitimacy to an ideology that at its most extreme results in the horrors of islamic state the author says but also makes the lives of millions of muslims living in islamic countries downright miserable 
what do these islamophobia whiners say to the millions of individuals who live in islamic theocracies and dream of liberty el rhazoui concludes in her book who speaks about the nightmare of a woman who decides to cross the streets of algiers casablanca or cairo in a skirt those who would like to drink a glass of alcohol in countries where you have to flout the law to do it  about homosexuals pariahs of muslim societies who often only have the choice of death prison or exile who speaks about this youth born muslim but dreaming of a normal life these teens attacked for having had a romance 


the summer furore over burkini bans in france agitated the author who deplored the cynical rush of islamists and their western sympathizers in the media academia and politics to celebrate the controversial swimsuit as a form of liberation and simultaneously a banal piece of cloth preferred by muslim women even though most never wear it 
western media in an intolerable readiness to oblige have defended the burkini as a freedom and a legitimate cultural expression of a part of humanity she said but pointed out that in muslim countries the beaches are not filling up with burkinis but they are emptying themselves of women from one year to another they are disappearing from the public space because the veil has never been anything except an extension of the walls of their harem to the exterior 
as for mainstream or moderate muslim clerics el rhazoui tells women in the world that during the burkini debate in france not one imam stood up and said hey wait a minute you can be muslim and wear a regular bathing suit 
history will judge those who have monopolized the debate given a platform to islamist fundamentalism and even given it a guarantee of acceptability the author of destroy islamic fascism told women in the world this is just betrayal and it is collaboration with one of the worst forms of fascism that exists today she said 
according to the writer who is repeatedly accused of bigotry the islamophobia ruse is driven by great ignorance and a lack of understanding of the culture of islam and what islam with a big i is  they ignore its complexity and that there have always been opposition currents and progressive and liberal pushes from within 
the accomplices dont recognize the struggles playing out today in arab countries will inevitably be won by the democrats and free people no fascism or totalitarianism has ever been able to win in the long haul of history the people who are the allies and collaborators of this totalitarianism today will be judged by history and seen as accomplices to this criminal ideology to which they have given a veneer of respectability 
for el rhazoui the true racism emerges from a condescending approach to islamic culture that decrees an islamic woman in a burqa is congenitally not free and that her race is the burqa we present the fundamentalists as being a race and this only shows the contempt we have for this culture it is absolutely intolerable she says 
survivor syndrome 
women in the world asked el rhazoui how she manages to keep up her spirits and continue her struggle for the freedom to dissent after everything that has happened since january  
it is a question people often ask me she said with a perceptible tremor in her voice but when you live through these moments in which you are confronted by a reality as cruel and simple as life and death you realize can put many things in perspective 
straight after the attacks like many of my colleagues i felt guilty for having stayed alive i said to myself those who are dead are dead for all our work and some are dead when it wasnt even their work but it was my work because i am a journalist and i am still here and then you understand this is all part of survivor syndrome which is normal when you survive a massacre like that 
as you start to heal you say i am lucky to be alive and if i am still here perhaps that is because i still have something to do i understood long before the attack on charlie when i engaged in a struggle for individual liberties and democracy in morocco that when you fight against totalitarianism whether it is political or religious you should never give your enemies the pleasure of stopping living we fight so that everyone can have a free and happy life and we must continue to live this same life 
zineb el rhazoui c attends the funeral of french cartoonist and charlie hebdo editor stephane charb charbonnier on january   in pontoise outside paris martin bureauafpgetty images 
still a day doesnt go past when she doesnt think of her old colleague charb and their many heated discussions 
he was someone who was extremely lucid and for whom the concepts were clear he was a true humanist who didnt fear being accused of being racist because for him it was absurd 
el rhazouis deconstruction of islam is also a defense of muslims she reasoned as salvation will come when we stop aligning the identity of an entire community with the most fundamentalist people who pretend to represent it 
we have to extend a hand to all these muslims who are free people who have questioned their heritage and who are fighters for liberty battling for the same values as us but in a context controlled by islamists she says 
life in a moving jail 
since january  the survivor from charlie hebdo has traveled frequently to speak at universities and meetings of the freedom forum in europe and the us under the protection assured by the french state and the countries that receive her she says she would never complain about living under permanent armed guard and having her freedom of mobility curtailed because so many other writers and political figures around the world  and especially in islamistcontrolled or influenced countries  are taking the brave decisions to do as she does but without any security 
i always find some spaces of freedom there are always little escape hatches life continues says the woman who has just written her second book since the charlie attacks and recently became a firsttime mother in what she laughingly called the surprise baby boom at a publication that used to have one of the lowest birthrates in french media 
today i wander around in a moving jail  its a moving cage  but in reality i am more free in my head than those who threaten me because their cage is inside their head they have this cage in their brain and even if they have freedom of movement it is their spirit and their reason and intelligence that is imprisoned i am much freer than them

commendably organized american jewry is finally focused on the campaign to boycott delegitimize and sanction israel however focusing primarily on israel and not also on america and europe is shortsighted 
the bds campaign has not devastated israel economically israel is thriving both economically and in terms of regional alliancesbut fifty years of a wellfunded propaganda campaign has all but destroyed israels good name and has rendered her and jews everywhere vulnerable to diplomatic academic and mob attacks 
it has also lowered the standards for truth among americans this is a very important point 
an islamicstyle of jew hatred has merged with western politically correct antiracism to breed an unnatural passion for palestinians fakestinians which has infiltrated every corner every crevice of our lives and world it has infected americans and europeans on both sides of the aisle and of every class race and ethnicity 
this is utterly astounding amazing really something like this does not happen overnight 
the bds campaign is rooted in the arab league plo and soviet propaganda campaign that began in the mids in the mids the un proposed its infamous zionismracism resolution 
in  the day after israel won yet another war of selfdefense israelnot the arab aggressorswas seen as the alleged occupier 
by the late s edward saids treacherous lying work had begun to have its way with western academics and with westernstyle academics in israel european governments and international organizations 
i only realized how successful his campaign was in  when israel was demonized at a un conference on women in copenhagen the soviets the iranians the arab league the plo roamed the hallways chanting death to israel european feminists called upon palestinian refugees but refused to hear jewishisraeli refugees from arab and muslim countries by  the un world conference against racism in durban was an even more outofcontrol hate fest and riot against israel 
as we approach  un resolutions against israel are as commonplace as they are grotesque unescos recent decision to dejudaize jerusalem the western wall and the first and second temples is a grim and maddening continuation of this trend at the same time proisrael professors and students in america are increasingly being harassed even fired 
such lies have infiltrated my private social world for example at a recent holiday dinner our guests agreed that we live in criminal and anarchic times and that no great power has stopped global barbarism no entity is willing to bring the world back from the brink 
a likeminded gathering yes not exactly one man a genial wellheeled welleducated jewishamerican suddenly began hectoring us about the palestinians what if they did not hate the jews and destroyed all their textbooks that demonize jews and israelis what if they were peaceful wouldnt we have to admit that palestinians have always existed and therefore deserve a state of their own you cant deny that the palestinian people have always lived there can you oh my where to start the company included two authorscholars who between them have published  books and thousands of articles many of them dealing with the history and nature of islam tribal gender and religious apartheid israel and antisemitism etc among us was a third author who had also served four tours of duty in the idf i held my breath and prayed that we would not go to war at the table this man was punching way above his pay grade and i could not understand why 
the two authorscholars presented facts cited statistics i pulled down book after book from my shelves we got nowhere look he said i have some really good muslim friends theyre americans totally westernized they are palestinians they strongly feel that this is their identity why deny them the identity of their choice and then i understood that the propalestinianantizionist propaganda behind the relentless bds campaign is successful precisely because so many americans of all ages are without knowledge without respect for knowledge do not know this and frankly dont care 
fair is fair he said in other words whats good for the jews has to be good for everyone else if not the jews dont deserve whatever it is either 
heres a man whos not an antisemite or an antizionist not an active member of any organizationyet who needs to believe the canard that nonjewish palestinians have always existed or that they existed by the nineteenth century or no later than  the year that another stateless peoplethe jewschose a national sovereign identity 
he would not listen to reason it was quite astounding how is this possible 
his mindset is part of our ruling american zeitgeist if rachel dolezal can say shes black even when shes white and direct a chapter of the naacp if a man can say that hes really a woman trapped in a mans body if all truths are relative if everything is subjective if objectivity is no longer important if doctored narratives have supplanted factbased histories if revisionism is preferred to truththen yes anyone can say that they deserve their own nation state because they feel or believe that they do 
i am grateful to my combative guest for reminding me that ignorance is often arrogant and as such is a great enemy that educated people have been especially vulnerable to false ideas that psychologically speaking we must approach them as if theyve been brainwashed by a cult 
facts alone will not work we must consider all known techniques for deprogramming 
this is one of our greatest challenges",english,frontpagemag.com,http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/10/nm_1.jpg?itok=2YWPFbXh,hate,Real

the intercepted shipments were filled with coastal defense cruise missiles boats that we believe were explosive boats other weapons that were clearly on the decks of their ships that we saw donegan said 
im sure theres no chance that the billions obama lavished on iranian jihadists have in any way freed up the terror state to open its own jihadi candy store not a chance

obama inc has a lot more luck with the media than it does with trials its lynchings of police officers have not gotten very far baltimore was the biggest and most resounding defeat but it wasnt the only one and the vastly differing treatment of the bundy protesters and the dakota pipeline protesters from killing to government backing have not had their intended effect 
instead obama lost at trial again 
this time its the bundy case that was when the left realized it hated civil disobedience just before rediscovering it again when it came to environmental protests but big gov lost this one  again 
a jury thursday delivered a stunning acrosstheboard acquittal to the leaders and participants in the malheur national wildlife refuge occupation and a remarkable blow to the federal government as it tries to tamp down a national movement led by a nevada family to open public lands to ranchers miners and loggers 
the verdicts finding ammon bundy older brother ryan bundy and five others not guilty of a federal conspiracy drew elation from defense attorneys who spent five weeks arguing that the armed takeover amounted to a timehonored tradition of first amendment protest and civil disobedience 
the highprofile case riveted the state and drew national and international attention to the isolated bird sanctuary in rural eastern oregon the jurys decision proved no less dramatic and sets up a showdown in the next stage of the landrights movement 
it means that big green gov will have to think twice next time around or do a much better job of picking a jury 
the oregon prosecutors sat silently in front of their boss us attorney billy williams and the head of the fbi in oregon greg bretzing as the judge announced the not guilty pleas one by one 
but it was quickly back to more of the same 
ut the trial fireworks werent quite over a brawl broke out at the very end when six to seven us marshals surrounded ammon bundys lawyer as he stood before the judge arguing and shouting for his client to walk out the door a free man they tackled him and stunned him with a taser gun as mumford yelled what are you doing us district judge anna j brown ordered everybody out of the courtroom

were talking about tehran joe biden of course who is good pals with the iran lobby biden is reportedly hillarys fantasy cabinet pick for secretary of state because the democrats have decided that secretary of state is a job too important to be trusted to experienced diplomats but should instead be reserved strictly as a consolation prize for failed presidential candidates 
heres a flashback on bidens views  
democratic vicepresidential candidate joe biden was quoted monday as telling senior israeli officials behind closed doors that the jewish state will have to reconcile itself to a nuclear iran in the unsourced report army radio also quoted biden as saying that he opposed opening a additional military and diplomatic front army radio said israeli officials expressed amazement over the remarks attributed to him israel will have to reconcile itself with the nuclearization of iran army radio quoted biden as telling the unnamed officials 
bidens people loudly denied the report but he had a history of being tight w ith the iran lobby 
some might call it reaching out to american muslims but to many iranians living in california a fundraiser for sen joseph biden ddel at the home of a prominent proiran lobbyist on feb  sent a wrongheaded message to the ruling clerics in tehran 
when we learned that sen biden was planning to hold a fundraiser at the california home of dr sadegh namazikhah we immediately contacted his office to express our dismay a prominent iranianamerican activist tells insight why dismay 
dr namazikhah is wellknown in the los angeles area for his support of the ruling clerical regime in tehran and is one of the regimes leading unofficial lobbyists in america we thought that sen biden might not know his background getting the chairman of the senate foreign relations committee to appear at this event will certainly be seen by the regime in tehran as a show of support 
on the eve of the fundraiser which brought an estimated  into bidens reelection coffers a biden staffer told the activist that the senators staff had all the facts necessary to make a decision and he was planning to attend the fundraiser despite the protests 
several participants who paid to attend the event tell insight that biden arrived at  pm stayed until  and delivered a sweeping condemnation of president george w bushs axis of evil formula 
as senator biden was not only undermining bush but fundraising off it at the home of supporters of a terrorist enemy state 
biden also impressed many of those present with his friendly attitude toward the islamic republic of iran the senator said that iran always wanted to be an ally of the united states and to have good relations with the us according to housang dadgostar a prominent lawyer as iranianamericans we dont want anything to happen to the iranian government or to the iranian people as a result of this war on terrorism says mohsen movaghar a los angeles businessman both men belong to the member board of directors of namazikhahs iranian muslim association of north america iman 
namazikhah denied any official contact with the iranian government but he tells insight that he regularly travels to iran  something many expatriates do  and that he actively supports moderates within the ruling clergy such as iranian president mohammad khatami in their efforts to bring reform to the islamic system 
namazikhah and other iman board members say bidens office contacted them to inquire if they would hold a private fundraiser for the senator who is up for reelection this year after meeting with them at a protehran gala in new york last december that event was sponsored by the americaniranian council aic a proregime lobbying group trying to get congress and the bush administration to lift the trade embargo on iran 
but biden had the perfect post  reaction  
after september th biden suggested sending  million to iran no strings attached as a gesture of good faith to the arab world 
at the tuesdaymorning meeting with committee staffers biden launches into a streamofconsciousness monologue about what his committee should be doing before he finally admits the obvious im groping here then he hits on an idea america needs to show the arab world that were not bent on its destruction 
seems to me this would be a good time to send no strings attached a check for  million to iran biden declares 
he surveys the table with raised eyebrows a how do ya like that look on his face

yes virginia you can now have both of them in one like peanut butter and jelly or shampoo and conditioner in one theyve been merged into one horrible stinking landfill for your entertainment and the downfall of the republic 
the fbi has reopened its investigation into hillary clintons use of a private server while secretary of state after discovering new emails  apparently during the probe of former rep anthony weiners sexting  in a stunning turn of events just days before the presidential election 
fbi director james comey wrote in a letter to top members of congress friday that the bureau has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation 
comey did not detail those emails saying only that they surfaced in connection with an unrelated case 
an fbi source though confirmed to fox news that the new emails were discovered after the bureau seized devices belonging to disgraced rep weiner and his wife huma abedin a top clinton aide who recently announced she was separating from the former congressman the new york times first reported on the weiner investigation connection noting the fbi had been probing texts weiner sent to a yearold girl 
as donald trump and congressional republicans seized on the fbis decision interim democratic party leader donna brazile simply tweeted good grief after the news of the anthony weiner connection broke 
cant argue with her there 
it would be hilarious if anthony weiner and thereby huma abedin led to the downfall of hillarys lifelong ambition you just know someone is going to commit suicide in a dc park

for more than  years the united states had a policy aimed at isolating the government of cuba for roughly half of those years un member states have voted overwhelmingly for a general assembly resolution that condemns the us embargo and calls for it to be ended the united states has always voted against this resolution today the united states will abstain applause thank you 
under obama power was told to abstain from opposing a resolution critical of the united states and they say obama is some sort of antiamerican traitor i dont see it if he were we would be seeing signs of it by now 
anyway power then went on to audition for the job of the un ambassador from cuba by claiming that critiques from a brutal communist dictatorship about our human rights are wellfounded 
let me be among the first to acknowledge  as our cuban counterparts often point out  that the united states has work to do in fulfilling these rights for our own citizens and we know that at times in our history us leaders and citizens used the pretext of promoting democracy and human rights in the region to justify actions that have left a deep legacy of mistrust

this is michael isikoff so the spin is an attack on comey though if comey couldnt get lynch to sign off on a warrant the public announcement could very well have been his way of pressuring the doj to do the right thing now that the emails are an election issue the only way to move forward is to allow the fbi to review them

comeydecided to disregard their concerns and sent the letter friday anyway shaking the presidential race  days before the election and nearly four months after the fbi chief said he wouldnt recommend criminal charges over the democratic nominees use of the server 
the officials acknowledged there was little lynch and yates could do given the fallout over lynchs controversial meeting over the summer with former president bill clinton

tester a massive jovial man who raises livestock on his family farm was more compelling than many of the other breakfast guests all of them political candidates the firm hoped would defend the interests of trial attorneys but the drill was basically the same the personal injury lawyers listened politely for a few minutes then returned to their offices and tester walked away with  in checks 
but a striking thing happened the day tester visited in  partner david c strouss received a payment from the firm labeled as a bonus that exactly equaled his  contribution to testers campaign the maximum allowed a few days later partner garrett bradley  until recently the house assistant majority leader on beacon hill  got a bonus too exactly matching his  gift to tester 
thats quite a coincidence 
from  through  strouss and bradley along with founding partner michael thornton and his wife donated nearly  million to democratic party fundraising committees and a parade of politicians  from senate minority leader harry reid of nevada to hawaii gubernatorial candidate david ige to senator elizabeth warren of massachusetts over the same span the lawyers received  million listed as bonuses in thornton law firm records more than  of the contributions precisely matched bonuses that were paid within  days

Daniel Greenfield,2016-10-30T13:39:16.216+02:00,media spin the fbis actions are deeply troubling not hillarys,"obamas doj also obstructed clinton foundation investigation october   
we now know that lynch and obamas doj are obstructing the investigation of hillary clintons emails the biased media is predictably spinning this as the fbi being in the wrong and hillarys backers at the doj being in the right 
but it also appears that the doj was obstructing any investigations of hillary including that of the clinton foundation 
the fbi field office in new york had done the most work on the clinton foundation case and received help from the fbi field office in little rock the people familiar with the matter said 
in february fbi officials made a presentation to the justice department according to these people by all accounts the meeting didnt go well 
some said that is because the fbi didnt present compelling evidence to justify more aggressive pursuit of the clinton foundation and that the career public integrity prosecutors in the room simply believed it wasnt a very strong case others said that from the start the justice department officials were stern icy and dismissive of the case 
that was one of the weirdest meetings ive ever been to one participant told others afterward according to people familiar with the matter 
justice department officials told the fbi at the meeting they wouldnt authorize more aggressive investigative techniques such as subpoenas formal witness interviews or grandjury activity but the fbi officials believed they were well within their authority to pursue the leads and methods already under way these people said 
of course the doj wouldnt authorize investigations of the democratic partys chosen thats the type of elemental corruption at work in the system",english,frontpagemag.com,http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/10/ht_obama_salute_kab_140923_16x9_992.jpg?itok=pcHxDuJl,hate,Real

thats quite an endorsement  and if theres anything top fbi officials now its crime families certainly this is probably the first serious level of experience that hillary can claim in any field 
the clintons thats a crime family basically former assistant fbi director james kallstrom said its like organized crime i mean the clinton foundation is a cesspool 
kallstrom best known for leading the investigation into the explosion of twa flight  in the late s said that hillary clinton the democratic presidential nominee was a pathological liar 
he also blasted attorney general loretta lynch claiming that she impeded the investigation into clintons private server 
the problem here is this investigation was never a real investigation he said thats the problem they never had a grand jury empanelled and the reason they never had a grand jury empanelled im sure is loretta lynch would not go along with that 
kallstrom also said that fbi director james comey and the rest of the fbis leadership were responsible for holding back the investigation not the rest of the bureau 
the agents are furious with whats going on i know that for a fact he said 
but according to the media the fbi investigating hillary is the real crime",english,frontpagemag.com,http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/10/hillary_clinton_1_2.jpg?itok=4ISnsqTA,hate,Real

originally published by the gatestone institute raymond ibrahim is a shillman fellow at the david horowitz freedom center 
as the muslim persecution of christians continues to reach critical proportions around the world see report below the average american shows much more concern than the current administration soon after it was revealed that the obama administration has taken in  muslim refugees but only  christianseven though christians are approximately  percent of syrias population and are classified as experiencing a genocide therea poll found that more than three quarters of american respondents agreed with the statement it is important to me that the next us president be committed to addressing the persecution that some christians face around the world eg imprisonment beheadings rape loss of home and assets

later when a journalist asked pope francis if fr jacques was  killed in the name of islam  the pope disagreed he argued that he hears of christians committing violence every day in italy this one who has murdered his girlfriend another who has murdered the motherinlaw and these are baptized catholics there are violent catholics if i speak of islamic violence i must speak of catholic violence the logic of the popes statement seems to be that violence done in direct contradiction of the judeochristian gods commandmentssuch as the murder of wives and mothersinlawis identical to violence done in accordance with allahs commandments to wage jihad on infidels

egypt  after a christian man was stabbed to death and many christian homes and a church burned by angry muslims because of a rumor that a church was going to be built coptic christian bishop makarious of alminya was interviewed on television church authorities in egypt are regularly diplomatic and sensitive to what they say but makarious made many revealing comments although only christians no muslims were killed and hurt he wondered why the government and media continue to describe these incidents as clasheswhich suggests two quarrelling partieswhen the reality is always that one side attacks the other within minutes of the start of one of the attacks  muslims instantly appeared fully armed as if ready for war he added as long as the attackers are never punished and the armed forces are portrayed as doing their duty this will just encourage others to continue the attacks since even if they are arrested they will be quickly released when the host asked questions about who is released and why suggesting that perhaps those released are in fact innocent of any wrongdoing against the christians the bishop replied well what do you think when the actual attackers themselves are arrested with complete proofs and evidences against them but then they are still declared innocent and released this happens every single time about this series 
the persecution of christians in the islamic world has become endemic accordingly muslim persecution of christians was developed to collate someby no means allof the instances of persecution that surface each month it serves two purposes 
 to document that which the mainstream media does not the habitual if not chronic persecution of christians 
 to show that such persecution is not random but systematic and interrelatedthat it is rooted in a worldview inspired by islamic sharia 
accordingly whatever the anecdote of persecution it typically fits under a specific theme including hatred for churches and other christian symbols apostasy blasphemy and proselytism laws that criminalize and sometimes punish with death those who offend islam sexual abuse of christian women forced conversions to islam theft and plunder in lieu of jizya financial tribute expected from nonmuslims overall expectations for christians to behave like cowed dhimmis  or thirdclass tolerated citizens and simple violence and murder sometimes it is a combination thereof 
because these accounts of persecution span different ethnicities languages and localesfrom morocco in the west to indonesia in the eastit should be clear that one thing alone binds them islamwhether the strict application of islamic sharia law or the supremacist culture born of it

university of california 
dear dr napolitano 
your school purports to promote the values of diversity inclusiveness and tolerance yet provides resources funding and legitimacy to students for justice in palestine students for justice in palestine is a campus organization whose sole purpose is to conduct hateful propaganda against jews and the jewish state for the terrorist organization hamas the explicit goals of hamas are the destruction of the worlds only jewish state and genocide against its jewish population for these reasons among others three campuses of the university of californiairvine los angeles and berkeleyhave been named among the top ten schools supporting terrorists by the david horowitz freedom center you may read the full report here httpwwwstopthejewhatredoncampusorgnewstoptenschoolssupportingterroristsfallreport 
while it masquerades as a typical campus cultural group sjp is an integral part of hamass efforts to annihilate israel through the boycott divestment and sanctions bds campaign this is an insidious effort that attempts to delegitimize israel and smear it as a rogue apartheid nation these claims are ludicrous more than a million palestinians enjoy israeli citizenship including the rights to vote and to sit on the israeli courts and parliament harvard professor alan dershowitz has said of the bds movement it is antisemitic antizionist antihuman rights antiintellectual antiscience antinegotiation antipeace anticompromise and antipalestinian workers when they are denied opportunities to work both larry summers and hillary clinton have denounced bds as antisemitic jew hatred yet your school provides a platform and funding for its sponsors 
with university support sjp also conducts israeli apartheid hate weeks on campus quads these events feature prohamas advocates the construction of apartheid walls featuring prohamas antisemitic propaganda and the creation of mock checkpoints and dieins that disrupt student movements on campus sjp actively disrupts proisrael campus eventsa threat to free speech and a violation of your universitys stated values and rules of conduct 
in addition to being scripted by hamas terrorists sjps proterror campaign is funded and guided through a hamas front called american muslims for palestine in recent testimony before the house foreign affairs committee jonathan schanzer who worked as a terrorism finance analyst for the united states department of the treasury from  described how hamas funnels large sums of money and provides material assistance to students for justice in palestine sjp through the hamas front group american muslims for palestine amp for the purpose of promoting bds campaigns on american campuses amp was created by sjp cofounder hatem bazian a proterrorist lecturer at uc berkeley who called for a suicide bombing intifada inside the united states it employs highranking officials from other muslim charities that were previously shut down for providing material assistance to terrorists 
schanzer described amp as arguably the most important sponsor and organizer for students for justice in palestine sjp which is the most visible arm of the bds campaign on campuses in the united states he detailed how amp provides speakers training printed materials a socalled apartheid wall and grants to sjp activists and even has a campus coordinator on staff whose job is to work directly with sjp and other probds campus groups across the country furthermore according to an email it sent to subscribers amp spent  on campus activities in  alone 
students for justice in palestine continues to accept funding and aid through the hamas front group american muslims for palestine despite its links to terrorist organizations and agendas students for justice in palestine continues to receive campus funds and campus privileges including university offices and the right to hold events preaching the genocidal values of hamas on university property these privileges would normally be denied to groups that preach hatred of any other ethnic group let alone one that supports barbaric terrorists who slaughter men women and children with the goal of cleansing the earth of people who disagree with them 
in light of these facts we ask that you withdraw all university privileges granted to sjp and other campus groups who promote the genocidal hamas agenda and that you put an end to the terrorist influences which have infiltrated your campus and which threaten the security not only of jewish students on your campus but of all americans

daniel greenfield a shillman journalism fellow at the freedom center is a new york writer focusing on radical islam 
september   has come and gone countless bodies lie scattered in fragments around where two of the countrys tallest skyscrapers once stood some have burned to ash others had their throats slashed by islamic terrorists still others fought and died on a plane to prevent another islamic terror attack from taking place 
but joe has an idea joe is a guy with lots of big ideas and this one is a real doozy 
the senator from delaware has come a long way since his days as a sixties shyster drumming up business in wilmington his formerly bald head is covered in hair so shiny is gleams under neon lights his teeth are capped and shine almost as brightly after a generation holding down a squeaky seat in the senate seniority makes him a man to be reckoned with and therefore a man to be listened to 
even if you wish he would shut up 
im groping here joe says for once he isnt referring to his notorious habits with women that will go on to make him the star of countless viral photographs massaging squeezing caressing instead hes talking about foreign policy the chair of the senate foreign relations committee has no clue 
joe is worried that the muslims will think badly of us after they murdered thousands of us and he has a plan to make them feel better 
seems to me this would be a good time to send no strings attached a check for  million to iran senator joe biden says 
the remark isnt quite as random as it seems the senator from delaware a state not known for its large muslim or iranian population has a friendly relationship with the iran lobby that relationship will only grow friendlier during the bush era as he attacks america and appeases its enemies 
iranianamericans who hate the jihadist government that has taken over their country and oppressed the persian people are outraged when he attends a fundraiser at a proiranian lobbyists home in california while treasonously attacking his own government for naming iran one of the members of the axis of evil 
joes usual amtrak obsession wouldnt get him in the door in california but treason hair plugs and capped teeth make him a big hit outside delaware and joe remains very fond of iran 
he informs israeli officials that israel will have to reconcile itself with the nuclearization of iran and thats all the way back in  before the deal that puts iran on the path to a shiite bomb was a nuclear twinkle in obamas eye and a radioactive itch in hillarys socks 
that was a big year for biden it was his first and biggest shot at the big chair in the white house joe had tried it in  and was stomped by dukakis of all people after being caught plagiarizing a speech by british politician neil kinnock  got him a useless position in the white house as a consolation prize 
this time around joe biden is expected to get the same consolation prize from hillary clinton that she got from barack obama the office of secretary of state of the united states 
of all the jobs that joe biden wants and is utterly unfit for amtrak train engineer secret agent and the guy in charge of counting all the money at the bar its hard to think of one that hes less fit for 
joe biden blamed darfur on the gingrich revolution he fell in love with the taliban 
the taliban per se is not our enemy joe insisted there is not a single statement that the president has ever made in any of our policy assertions that the taliban is our enemy 
he suggested that  of the taliban were probably okay and only  were incorrigible most of the taliban he seemed to think were like joe biden just in it for the money 
but joe biden has a soft spot for islamic terrorists whether theyre the shiite jihadists of iran or the sunni jihadists of the taliban joe loves all the terrorists of the world and the terrorists love him back 
it wasnt that long ago that we were being lectured to by the media on bushs ruination of relations with the rest of the world if biden were to become secretary of state he would become the third democratic presidential campaign loser to get the job as a consolation prize for his failures as a politician the last time a professional held down the job would have been the bush administration 
and yet perversely each loser secretary has been more incompetent than the last hillarys disastrous time as secretary of state could only be exceeded by john kerry who gave away everything to the russians and who was contradicted by the white house so many times it would have humiliated a lesser man or just any man the only loser who could follow two class acts like that was joe biden 
joe bidens amateur diplomacy has been one disaster after another even his visit to israel a friendly ally not known for fractious political visits by american politicians became an international incident with biden sulking in his room while hillary yelled at prime minister netanyahu for  minutes over the phone but somehow biden with his gift for appeasing iran and the taliban alienates allies 
just this year joe biden launched yet another attack on israel a cynic might almost think that tehran joe loves islamic terrorists and hates those who resist them and fight against them 
biden has claimed that terrorism is not an existential threat he accused president bush of being shortsighted for using the military to fight islamic terrorists he argued that the perception that we want to stay in iraq helps al qaeda some years later his administrations decision to pull out led to the rise of isis he called for closing gitmo while insisting that it had become the greatest propaganda tool that exists for recruiting of terrorists around the world 
senator joe biden was a voice for appeasement vice president joe biden was part of an administration that empowered and unleashed the malignant power of islamic terror secretary of state joe biden would be able to act out his worst fantasies he could even write that check to iran though the obamabiden era has seen cash transfers to iran that make joes  million check seem like chump change 
hillary clintons rise doesnt just mean that she will be making big decisions it will mean that joe biden will have gone from a wilmington shyster to running the foreign policy of a country he has betrayed",english,frontpagemag.com,http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/10/pers.jpg?itok=QuZYOt2a,hate,Real
No Author,2016-10-31T10:53:40.058+02:00,americans seek to help persecuted christians government helps muslims  frontpage magazine,"hillary clinton and the presidents  longer game  at home and abroad a nation less affluent less free and far less secure october   lloyd billingsley 
the president of the united states the most powerful man in the world used a pseudonym to communicate with secretary of state hillary clinton on her private unsecured email server as andrew mccarthy contended  that was the reason the fbi declined to prosecute clinton because the president would have been part of the same action and that wouldnt be politically correct 
the current president of the united states is also on record that contrary to custom he will linger in washington dc for a few years wherever he chooses to live the email intrigue suggests continuing backchannel communications with hillary clinton should she become president that invites a look at what the man the new york times dubbed obamas narrator the white house adviser who sat closest to the president and signed off on his every word had to say about the presidents vision of the future 
few of the decisions he had made would satisfy the politics of the moment david axelrod explained in his massive  believer  but at home and abroad obama was playing a longer game as he explained in columbia missouri on october   we are five days away from fundamentally transforming the united states of america 
if this man was a liberal as barry rubin wondered in silent revolution how the left rose to political power and cultural dominance  why did he see a need fundamentally to transform a nation shaped by liberals such as franklin roosevelt with his new deal and lyndon johnson with his great society he saw the need because he was not a liberal but a lifelong leftist radical 
as david horowitz explained in volume  of the black book of the american left  the president was born bred and trained in the progressive movement his mentors were communists and their progressive successors so no wonder he presided over the institutionalizing of the policies of the left in government for eight years what that means in practical terms is becoming painfully evident 
the economy remains sluggish and under obamacare the presidents signature plan premiums are skyrocketing  this suggests that as many believe obamacare was simply a demolition plan in the longer game designated successor hillary clinton will impose government monopoly healthcare what some candidates erroneously call socialized medicine 
as rubin noted the goal of the left is to convince americans the exact opposite of what their experience proved that the country had fundamentally failed and the old leftist solutions were the answer the result may be a very longterm and even permanent change of the united states into something else a nation far less affluent and far less free and far less secure as david axelrod also indicates 
vladimir putin makes an appearance in believer but obamas narrator does not outline putins background in the kgb the believer includes nothing about putins role in east germany a stalinist police state that walled in its subjects and shot those attempting to escape the narrator avoids putins belief that the breakup of the soviet union was the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century

Frontpagemag.com,2016-10-31T11:11:00.000+02:00,freedom center urges college presidents to end aid to campus supporters of terror,"search selective outrage over splcs antimuslim extremist list leftists and atheists appalled that splcs hit list of islam critics includesleftists and atheists october   robert spencer 
sam harris thinks its unbelievable that maajid nawaz and ayaan hirsi ali made it to the southern poverty law centers hit list of antimuslim extremists he said nothing about me or the other people whom the splc included which is not surprising since he has quite recently expressed willingness to acquiesce in other contexts to the demonization that the splc list exemplifies 
hemant mehta of the friendly atheist blog ably sums up the outrage over nawaz and hirsi ali being included if criticizing religious beliefs makes them extremists then it wont be long before other vocal atheists end up on that list too and make no mistake thats what nawaz and hirsi ali are doing thats all theyre doing theyre not antimuslim they work with moderate muslims theyre critical of the worst aspects of islam 
the problem with being angry about nawaz and hirsi ali being on the splc list but silent about everyone else who is on it is that what mehta says about nawaz and hirsi ali can quite accurately said about everyone else on the list if criticizing religious beliefs makes them extremists then it wont be long before everyone who dares to utter a critical word about islam will be on the list  and that is indeed the objective of the list to stigmatize and marginalize any and all such critics mehta protests that nawaz and hirsi ali are not antimuslim they work with moderate muslims theyre critical of the worst aspects of islam 
but no one would think that the other  were antimuslim if it hadnt been for the southern poverty law center and the hamaslinked council on americanislamic relations cair and their allied groups insisting that we were all these years in their avidity to conflate opposition to jihad terror and sharia oppression with hating a group of people  a tactic designed to discredit opposition to jihad terror and sharia oppression mehta and co are falling for and validating the same smear tactics hey are decrying when used against their friends 
and as for working with moderate muslims for  years jihad watch has contained this invitation  any muslim who renounces violent jihad and dhimmitude is welcome to join in our antijihadist efforts it is nawaz as well as other moderates who has attacked me in what appears to have been a cynical attempt to gain support for himself among muslims i never attacked him and would have have been happy to work with him otherwise 
in complaining that nawaz and hirsi ali are merely criticizing religious beliefs and are not antimuslim mehta is strongly implying that the others on the splc list are doing something beyond criticizing religious beliefs and are indeed antimuslim on twitter the last couple of days ive seen many people express outrage that nawaz has been lumped in with the likes of spencer but when i ask them what the big difference is between us or for quotes from me that are actually bigoted they go silent 
mehta harris haider and the others who are only angry with the splcs hit list because it included nawaz and hirsi ali are by their selective outrage acquiescing to and legitimizing the splcs demonization of the other people on the list in his own defense hemant mehta wrote me to explain somewhat unsatisfactorily i focused on those two because theyre well known in atheist circles this is a selfdefeating choice for them to have made for the splc has never identified anyone whom it considers to be a legitimate critic of islam and never will the point of lists such as the one they released yesterday is to demonize and silence everyone who dares say something about islam that is not warmly positive 
the turn of mehta harris and haider will come for the same treatment one wonders if when this happens there will be anyone left to speak for them who has not already been smeared as antimuslim with their tacit approval",english,frontpagemag.com,http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/10/sdf.jpg?itok=a_1pk7_P,hate,Real
Daniel Greenfield,2016-10-31T11:09:00.000+02:00,meet hillary clintons secretary of state,"a resolution on jerusalem that will fuel antijewish incitement and violence october   joseph puder 
if anyone doubted the fact that the united nations agencies harbored a deepseated antiisrael and antijewish animus the united nations educational scientific and cultural organization unesco vote on jerusalem proved it the unesco world heritage committee voted this week october   on a resolution dealing with jerusalem drafted by the palestinian and jordanian delegations and submitted by kuwait lebanon and tunisia all arab muslim states the executive committee of unesco approved  for  opposed  abstained and  missing the resolution that was already voted on earlier this month in which  memberstates approved the resolution algeria bangladesh brazil cuba chad dominican republic egypt iran lebanon malaysia morocco mauritius mexico mozambique nicaragua nigeria oman pakistan qatar russia senegal south africa sudan and vietnam  opposed estonia germany lithuania the netherlands uk and the us among the abstaining  states were argentina france greece india japan kenya south korea spain sri lanka and sweden 
the resolution deeply decries the continuous israeli aggressions against civilians including islamic religious figures and priests decries the forceful entering into the different mosques and historic buildings and into muslim holy sites by israelis including employees of the socalled israeli antiquities israel is urged to end these aggressions and abuses which inflame the tension on the ground and between faiths 
according to hillel neuer executive director of un watch a genevabased watchdog organization the resolution which is likely to be adopted dangerously risks fueling antijewish incitement and violence and legitimizing the escalating palestinian denial of jewish and cultural rights neuer added that this inflammatory narrative praised last week by hamas rewards the past years relentless palestinian stabbing and shooting attacks in jerusalem and other parts of israel which we mustnt forget began with false claims that israel was planning to damage the holy muslim shrines 
the expected resolution mentions eleven times alharam alsharif the muslim designation to what jews call har habayit the holiest shrine in judaism where the temple of solomon stood and also known as temple mount with the islamic bloc controlling the largest voting bloc in the un it is no wonder that a resolution of this kind can be approved oic organization of islamic cooperation being the largest and most influential bloc at the un it might as well declare that the earth is flat and it will garner a majority vote at the general assembly or its other un constituent agencies what this resolution effectively does to jerusalem is to islamize sites historically belonging to other faiths 
the latest draft does not describe the western wall as the most hallowed remains of the jewish holy temple destroyed by the romans in ce but as the western wall of al aqsa mosque in a blatant effort to erase the jewish heritage and biblical truth and as part of a campaign to islamize the site it shamelessly disregards the fact that jewish worshippers have prayed at the wall for over two thousand years the language of the draft resolution continues the deliberate attempt by the palestinian authority pa to deny the jewish historical connection to the land of israel in general and to jerusalem in particular mahmoud abbas has continued on the path of denial that arafat initiated at camp david 
among the charges brought up by the pa and the other arabmuslim states for undertaking the resolution is that the jerusalem light rail which is used daily by thousands of arab residents of jerusalem is having a damaging effect on the visual integrity and the authentic character of the walls of the old city of jerusalem yet the rail tracks pass through an existing highway and facilitates effective transportation for visitors of all faiths 
preceding the shameless resolution and the vote that took place in the paris headquarters of unesco israels president reuven rivlin stated at an event in his jerusalem residence no forum or body in the world can come and deny the connection between the jewish people the land of israel and jerusalem  and any such body that does so simply embarrasses itself we can understand criticism but you cannot change history 
unescos director general irina bokova and the chairman of unescos executive board michael worbs expressed displeasure and apologized for the resolution in an interview with israeli tv channel  on october   the day following the vote worbs said he hoped that the boards tuesday meeting will be delayed in order to reach consensus on the resolution before a formal vote bokova on her part expressed her dismay at the resolution saying that efforts to deny history and the citys jerusalem complex multifaith character harms unesco 
earlier in july  bokova stated that the heritage of jerusalem is indivisible and each of its communities have a right to the explicit recognition of their history and relationship with the city to deny or conceal any of the jewish christian or muslim traditions undermines the integrity of the site and runs counter to the reasons that justified its inscription in  as a world heritage site 
unesco can be counted as one of the most antiisrael un agencies in the course of a typical year the organizations legislative bodies will condemn israel  or more times with no criticism aimed at any other country in the world in  for example unesco adopted  antiisrael decisions  eight at the  st and  nd sessions of the executive board and two at the  th session of the general conference again in  unesco adopted  antiisrael decisions at the  th and  th sessions of the executive board in  unesco again adopted  antiisrael decisions at the  th and  th sessions of the executive board and two resolutions against israel at the  th session of the general conference 
whereas jerusalem was king davids capital and continued to be the capital of the second jewish commonwealth as well as israels capital today it was never the capital of any arab or muslim empire caliphate or entity nor was jerusalem a spiritual center that muslims yearned for the umayyad caliphate had its capital in damascus the abbasside caliphate capital was baghdad and the ottoman empires caliphate capital was constantinople ramle a small town in israel was its administrative capital in palestine  not jerusalem a palestinian state never existed as an independent entity and the pa claims on jerusalem are strictly contrarian  to deny jerusalem as the heart of jewish spirituality and yearning jerusalem exists in every jewish prayer and is invoked on every occasion and holiday 
dore gold former director general of israels foreign ministry addressed last years unescos jerusalem resolution he pointed out that the resolution glossed over any jewish connection to jerusalem and it failed to acknowledge christianitys ties to jerusalem 
most dismaying is the fact that christian nations who voted for the resolution or abstained have abandoned all vestiges of pride and honor and are willing to deny historical truth for narrow political interests brazil mexico and the dominican republic predominantly catholic states are a case in point unfortunately other christian countries including france spain greece argentina and sweden who should know about jerusalem from their church bibles did not have the courage to reject this outrageously false resolution it can only lead to the conclusion that perhaps cowardice and latent antisemitism drove their decision to accept not reject this infamous resolution",english,frontpagemag.com,http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/10/dr_1.jpg?itok=23-8EVDd,hate,Real
Lloyd Billingsley,2016-10-31T11:09:00.000+02:00,hillary clinton and the presidents longer game,"is hillary panicking over the fbi and weiner emails   
these past few days have seen a major shift in the clinton tactics during the original investigation the clinton campaign and its political and media allies launched attacks at republicans for wasting time investigating hillary but did not attack the fbi it misrepresented fbi statements but it certainly did not target investigators in the way were seeing now 
but now we have open hostilities between lynch at the doj and the fbi we have the clinton campaign circulating a letter attacking the fbi we have countless media hit pieces aimed at the fbi 
the obvious question is why the clinton campaign kept its cool at least to some degree before it certainly didnt begin an illadvised campaign against the fbi thats the kind of tactic that may play to your core base but alienates everyone else that is to say everyone who isnt in the media 
so whats going on here 
 the clintons thought they were done its close to the election so theyre lashing out its typically paranoid and nasty behavior by the clintons hillary tried playing humble she tried apologizing but a moment ago her victory seemed inevitable and now shes in a state of fury at having it put at risk 
 there is something in those emails that genuinely frightens the clinton campaign which is why it took the crazy risk of going after the fbi with both barrels its desperate to smear the fbi as much as possible in order to neutralize any revelations or even potential charges the attacks are a warning to treat hillary with kid gloves again or else 
the first is plausible to a degree but for all of hillarys awkwardness she didnt lose it in the past why is she losing it now theres no evidence beyond speculation for the latter and yet the major shift in tactics is rather striking if the clinton campaign were panicking this is what it would look like",english,frontpagemag.com,http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/10/mn.jpg?itok=VggFnaBh,hate,Real
Robert Spencer,2016-10-31T11:08:00.000+02:00,selective outrage over splcs antimuslim extremist list," reminders to ignore the trump is doomed polls   
weve recently had two object lessons in the worthlessness of the trump is doomed polling saga a few days ago the media was loudly trumpeting that hillarys victory was inevitable that the polls were in and she was going to ignore trump and focus on building her administration and winning downticket races and then just like last time around the numbers turned around again 
i was recently asked to predict the race i answered that the one thing i could predict is that the media will claim a landslide for hillary right before the election that much is very likely 
its in the medias interest to spread fud by promoting polls that predict not just a hillary win but a landslide creating the perception that voting is useless the more republicans feel that the outcome is futile the less likely they will be to go out and vote but the scandal polling numbers have a history of rebounding this remains a challenging and very unusual election 
the premature panic weve seen in some circles is unhealthy we shouldnt completely ignore poll numbers but neither should we treat them as inevitable 
weve had two major lessons in why thats short sighted",english,frontpagemag.com,http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/10/nbv.jpg?itok=c1RwRhG5,hate,Real

remember last week when hillary clinton was shopping around for white house drapes and the popular wisdom was that she was inevitable that was fun wasnt it now she hit an unfavorability rating high of  percent thats higher than trump 
it also means that the candidate who claims shes going to bring americans together is disliked by most of the country  
clinton is seen unfavorably by  percent of likely voters in the latest results a new high trump is seen unfavorably by essentially as many   percent marking the depth of these views  percent see clinton strongly unfavorably and  percent say the same about trump  unusual levels of strong sentiment 
the extent of partisan antipathy in this poll produced for abc by langer research associates is remarkable ninetyseven percent of trump supporters see clinton unfavorably  percent strongly so ninetyfive percent of clinton supporters see trump unfavorably  again  percent strongly so 
but remember hillary is inevitable 
now the clinton campaign has decided to go after the fbi under the assumption that people like hillary more than the fbi that may be a slight misjudgment and by slight i mean huge because not only is the fbi more popular than hillary so are major landfills ufo cattle mutilations and a number of international war criminals",english,frontpagemag.com,http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/10/bagdad-bob_2.gif?itok=xOeoGjV6,hate,Real

were not talking about debbie wasserman schultz the exmuppet in charge of the dnc who was forced to resign because of the way the dnc rigged the process to favor hillary this is donna brazile who was brought in to replace her to bring back integrity to the dnc since brazile is another clinton loyalist that was never going to happen 
but the latest leak reveals that brazile had passed along a second debate question to hillary all this just emphasizes how fraudulent and rigged the whole debate process was 
another leaked email has emerged showing democratic national committee boss and former cnn contributor donna brazile sharing a debate question in advance with the hillary clinton campaign  despite braziles persistent claims to the contrary 
cnn announced in a statement soon after the email became public monday that brazile had tendered her resignation and the network accepted it on oct  days after the controversy over brazile tipping off the clinton campaign initially broke 
according to documents released monday by wikileaks brazile sent clinton communications director jennifer palmieri an email titled one of the questions directed to hrc tomorrow is from a woman with a rash the night before the march  cnn primary debate in flint mich 
her family has lead poison and she will ask what if anything will hillary do as president to help the ppl of flint brazile wrote 
the following night leeanne walters a mom whose twin boys stopped growing and whose daughter lost her hair during the flint water contamination crisis posed a question to both clinton the eventual democratic presidential nominee and her primary opponent vermont sen bernie sanders

Daniel Greenfield,2016-10-31T14:57:59.537+02:00,reminders to ignore the trump is doomed polls,"independents tilt decisively to trump october   daniel greenfield 
independents are the largest political group in the country larger than either democrats or republicans and theyre tilting toward trump and the gop 
adding in ideology the tracking poll shows clinton going from  percent support among liberal democrats early in the tracking poll to  percent now while trumps gone from  percent among conservative republicans to  percent now 
independents  sometimes swing voters in past elections albeit inconsistently  also merit attention theyve gone from a scant  points in clintons favor in the first four nights of tracking  percent to a substantial trump lead now  percent clintontrump 
a key element here is the partisan preferences of independents who emerge as likely to vote they were  points more likely to lean toward the republican party rather than the democratic party at the start of tracking but are  points more apt to do so now 
hillary clinton tried to win over independents by positioning her brand as a moderate centrist who can work with republicans and can get things done while portraying trump as dangerous and irresponsible it certainly worked to a degree 
trumps pitch was that hes not a conventional republican and he can overturn a rigged system the drain the swamp speech was a key element the latter is more likely to ultimately appeal to people who identify as none of the above because theyre disgusted with both parties",english,frontpagemag.com,http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/10/a-fly-landed-directly-on-hillary-clintons-face-during-the-second-presidential-debate.jpg_8.png?itok=A_x95L9u,hate,Real

the hillary clinton whineaton continues 
after having mobilized mulltiple exofficials and media types to attack the fbi the clinton campaign whose candidate blatantly benefited from white glove from the fbi is complaining about a double standard 
hillary clintons campaign accused fbi director james comey monday of engaging in a blatant double standard 
clintons campaign manager robby mook slammed comey in the wake of reports that the fbi director refused to publicly comment on potential donald trump campaign ties to russias alleged efforts to meddle with the us election but did weigh in on an updated investigation involving clintons email server 
it is impossible to view this as anything less than a blatant double standard mook clintons campaign manager said on a call with reporters that director comey would show more discretion in a matter concerning a foreign state action than one involving the democratic nominee for president is nothing short of jawdropping 
yes its jaw dropping that mook cant grasp how investigations work 
comey had no reason to comment on the trump thing because it wasnt part of an existing criminal investigation of trump there has been despite hillarys bottomless barrel of lies a criminal investigation of hillary clinton

democrats are in panic mode a week out from election day as they try to spin away the fbis newly announced discovery of a hoard of twothirds of a million potentially sensitive emails apparently related to hillary clintons catastrophic tenure as americas top diplomat 
partisan hack james carville is spewing wild conspiracy theories 
i think it is an outrage and i think the fact that the kgb is involved in this election is an outrage and i think the american people ought to take their democracy back regardless of what the press wants to do and the excuses they want to make for fbi director james comey thats what i think 
he added this is in effect an attempt to hijack an election it ought to be called for what it is 
just this past july comey was praised by democrats far and wide for his wisdom in opting not to pursue clinton there is evidence federal officials tried to hinder various investigations of clinton and the endlessly corrupt bill hillary and chelsea clinton foundation which functions as a bribe processing center for wouldbe president hillary clinton 
but democrats have suddenly flipped sides denouncing comey as an enemy of the republic now that he has opened an investigation into the newly discovered emails 
carville long known as the ragin cajun is apoplectic because he thinks these emails could change the dynamics of the election 
the old clinton hand may be right 
investigators found  emails on a laptop computer they believe was used at home by disgraced former rep anthony weiner d and his wife longtime senior hillary aide huma abedin the computer is reportedly the same device serial pervert weiner used to send sexual messages to an underage girl 
underlying metadata suggests thousands of those messages could have been sent to or from the private server that mrs clinton used while she was secretary of state according to people familiar with the matter reports the wall street journal  some of the information emailed may have been classified 
abedin who has intergenerational ties to the muslim brotherhood reportedly forwarded sensitive government information to her personal yahoo email account and may have viewed them on her home laptop 
over the objections of attorney general loretta lynch comey notified congress of the information about the previously unknown emails at this late stage in the election cycle because after letting hillary off the hook this summer he was facing a huge uprising among fbi employees the overwhelming majority of whom are not unprincipled supplicants to power 
lynch is doing her best to make sure the department of justice probe goes nowhere 
assistant attorney general for legislative affairs peter j kadzik whom zero hedge calls the best friend of john podesta hillarys campaign chairman and former white house chief of staff in bill clintons administration is heading up the email probe 
so the fix is in 
in any event the prospect of restoring his good name may also have prompted comey to act 
people are upset at comey because he took the cowards way out in the email investigation and is viewed as helping the clinton team and the obama white house in their efforts to cover up wrongdoing 
it was back on july  comey announced that despite the massive body of damning evidence accumulating against clinton he would not recommend charges be brought against the former secretary of state for her use of hackerfriendly homebrew private email servers to conduct official business clinton and her aides were extremely careless in their handling of classified documents but there was no evidence of criminal intent he said even though the relevant national security statute does not require intent the next day attorney general lynch confirmed no charges would be laid against hillary lynch as everyone now knows had a clandestine meeting with former president bill clinton at a phoenix airport a week before at which a corrupt bargain was presumably made 
this internal rebellion in the investigative agency was serious enough that comey felt he had to act immediately 
i have some sources in the fbi and the former district attorneys commentator larry kudlow said sunday on nbcs meet the press the fbi is in full revolt right now the fbi has been in full revolt since the decisions made last summer 
ever the hillary shill host chuck todd corrected kudlow 
not full revolt he said theres been a lot i mean itsthere are agentslets not say full revolt 
all right a semifull revolt said kudlow 
because what im getting at is if comey hadnt said what he said to congress and the rest of the world it would have leaked it would have leaked that whole building was ready to leak that they had discovered this new source with anthony weiner and huma abedin so i dont think comey had much chance here and i think the fbi is badly divided 
meanwhile the trickle of bad news for hillary clinton has turned into a raging flood in the last few days 
clinton has been directly implicated in a nasty false flag operation against the donald trump campaign top democrat operatives robert creamer and scott foval were caught on undercover video describing their involvement in an elaborate criminal conspiracy involving the use of targeted political violence against political opponents the euphemism employed was conflict engagement which means paying leftist agitators the homeless and the mentally ill to cause melees at trump rallies 
fomenting violence and physically attacking political opponents was what the fascist third reich did using the sturmabteilung or sa also called brown shirts and storm troopers 
longtime democrat pollster and campaign consultant doug schoen a familiar face on fox news channel announced he could no longer in good conscience support clintons candidacy 
im deeply concerned that well have a constitutional crisis if shes elected he said sunday if the secretary of state wins we will have a president under criminal investigation with top aide huma abedin under criminal investigation 
republican donald trump is closing the gap in national polls of likely voters 
clintons unfavorability rating in polls now exceeds trumps shes at  percent hes at  percent 
former new york mayor and leading trump surrogate rudy giuliani said over the weekend that enough evidence has surfaced from wikileaks and the fbi to indict clinton for racketeering bill clinton does the speeches they put the money in the pocket she does the favors in the government said giuliani a former federal prosecutor it all links up why did they destroy  emails because it shows the link 
influential liberal journalist ron fournier threw hillary under the bus mrs clinton got a secret server to protect what the washington post called the circle of enrichment he said 
if hillary clinton wins next week media outlets across america will have to hire extra investigative journalists to handle all the corruption exposes that will follow",english,frontpagemag.com,http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/10/hillary_clinton3_3_2.jpg?itok=gjjQHTJr,hate,Real
Daniel Greenfield,2016-10-31T19:56:35.868+02:00,independents tilt decisively to trump,"how the nevertrumpers sunk themselves november   
bruce thornton is a shillman journalism fellow at the david horowitz freedom center 
the chorus of nevertrumpers is wailing ever louder as election day and hillarys supposed victory approach after more than a year of complaining about trump crashing their political soiree the republicans attacking trump still dont seem to get how their own behavior contributed to the perception that they are outoftouch elites disdainful of the republican masses 
a recent example comes from premier nevertrumper bret stephens of the wall street journal  in his column stephens bids farewell to a republican party stupid enough to nominate trump contrasting it with his imagined golden age of republican policy excellence that trump and his followers have destroyed one policy in particular immigration reveals the distance between the political and pundit elite and the voting masses that helped make trump the nominee 
at a  republican primary debate in houston candidates george hw bush and ronald reagan were asked whether the children of illegal immigrants should be allowed to attend public schools for free mr bush said they should were creating a whole society of really honorable decent familyloving people that are in violation of the law he lamented 
reagan agreed instead of putting up a fence he asked why dont we    make it possible for them to come here legally with a work permit and then while theyre working and earning here they pay taxes here for good measure reagan suggested we should open the border both ways 
where in the populist fervor to build a wall with mexico and deport millions of human beings is that republican party today 
take bush seniors statement first it repeats basically the same clichés that the bipartisan gang of eight recycled in  during their push for comprehensive immigration reform another euphemism for amnesty all those hardworking familyvalues illegal immigrants are embryonic conservatives we were told who just need legal status and social recognition so they can come out of the shadows as john mccain said and start voting republican the political apple doesnt fall far from the tree son jeb ended his presidential ambitions by calling illegal immigration an act of love 
this stance on illegal immigration by republican politicos and pundits is obviously lightyears from the experience and position of many ordinary people take mccains oftrepeated trope of living in the shadows seriously illegal alien young people openly protest on live television knowing they are not going to be deported millions visit emergency rooms for free and wrangle food stamps welfare transfers school lunches and all sorts of largess all the while they live protected by sanctuary cities and living in the shadows doesnt deter them from committing felonies given that even if caught convicted and deported theyll soon be back remember juan francisco lopezsanchez the illegal alien deported five times who murdered kate steinle or angel gilberto garciaavalos another fivetime deportee who just this month started a  million fire in sequoia national park he had just been released from the kern county jail but could not be deported because of californias lunatic sanctuary city law which prohibits a sheriff from contacting federal agents 
simply repeating the hardworking family values religious mantra doesnt address the problems of illegal immigration there are such illegal immigrants as i know from over sixty years of personal experience living in the san joaquin valley one of the largest concentrations of illegal aliens in the country i grew up with mexicanamericans theyre members of my immediate family theyre my friends students and colleagues theyre also the victims of the crimes and disorder caused by our porous border 
some illegals do transition into these sort of immigrants but many do not a rigorous vetting process might sort out the wheat from the chaff but bush mccain and stephens have not proposed a workable rigorous mechanism for determining who should stay and who should go that means with any form of amnesty citizenship will likely be granted indiscriminately with only the most egregious felons sifted out if any are stupid enough to apply for citizenship rather than continuing to live in the shadows but all those guilty of duis hitandruns or defrauding the welfare system with fake ids will stayand then bring their extended families under the provisions of the disastrous  immigration act which enshrined family reunification with no limits on relatives of us citizens 
equally tonedeaf is stephenss bringing up ronald reagans open the border both ways thats exactly what he did in  when he signed the simpsonmazzoli act which granted amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants with promises of border enforcement that never materialized stephens doesnt mention that as a result the number of illegal immigrants increased from about  million to  million creating todays crisis the obvious lesson is secure the border first then figure out what to do with the  million it would be governmental malfeasance to repeat reagans mistake 
the problem with politicians and pundits like stephens is they dont live with the consequences of indiscriminately letting in people from very different cultures and mores people like stephens dont live daily with the disorder and crime that results theyre not aware of the extensive damage to quality of life the illegal immigration version of broken windows such as dogs without rabies shots running free health and safety codes ignored building codes shrugged off garbage and refuse dumped everywhere copper wire stolen from pumps and street lights and chronic petty theftand thats on top of stolen cars hitandruns driving without insurance gangbanging and dealing drugs 
and if mr stephens thinks im just a nativist or xenophobe or racist i dare him to visit the san joaquin valley better yet let him bring his wife and children to live there for a month come and tour a hospital emergency room a social security disability office a public school a county jail and then wax lyrical about these honorable decent familyloving people it would take just a week for mr stephens to develop a fervor for a fivefoot high wall around his house and buy four or five pit bulls and a shotgun then again he wouldnt last that long within a day hed scurry back to his nice white secure tony neighborhood where he doesnt have to pay the cost of his moral preening 
and that hypocrisy is where trump came from in the perception of millions of votersperceptions nevertrumpers have fed so incessantly that they look a lot like realitythe conservative politicians and pundits care more about their privileged status and purity of principle than they do about the welfare and interests of their partys voters and so they would rather see a venal perjurious corrupt mediocrity become obama  and continue the progressive destruction of the constitutional order than see elected the nominee of their own party what sort of principle is that",english,frontpagemag.com,http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/11/user812517_pic124606_1438224400.jpg?itok=QpaJjlyy,hate,Real
Daniel Greenfield,2016-11-01T06:27:23.010+02:00,hillary clinton campaign still whining about the fbi,"obama wont vote with america at the un under obama the united states wont defend the united states november   daniel greenfield 
daniel greenfield a shillman journalism fellow at the freedom center is a new york writer focusing on radical islam 
a generation ago the communist tyranny in cuba demanded that the united nations condemn america for the embargo the brutal castro regimes rant accused the united states of threatening nuclear annihilation countless acts of sabotage and plans to assassinate cuban leaders 
on a cold day in october the european leftwing activist serving as un ambassador announced to applause that her administration would no longer be voting to defend the us at the un 
un member states have voted overwhelmingly for a general assembly resolution that condemns the us embargo and calls for it to be ended the united states has always voted against this resolution today the united states will abstain samantha power said 
thank you she added acknowledging the applause 
under obama the united states would no longer defend the united states a generation ago the communists had been in cuba now they were in washington dc 
instead of defending america obamas chosen representative agreed that our communist enemies had a point about our lack of human rights and our imperialist foreign policy 
let me be among the first to acknowledge  as our cuban counterparts often point out  that the united states has work to do in fulfilling these rights for our own citizens and we know that at times in our history us leaders and citizens used the pretext of promoting democracy and human rights in the region to justify actions that have left a deep legacy of mistrust she said 
if the cuban representative had been in her place he could not have done much better communist cuban propaganda was now being parroted by ambassador power if the castro dictatorship wanted to save money it could shut down its propaganda department and outsource the labor to washington dc 
the cuban ambassador boasted that cuban communists had rid ourselves of us imperialism and proclaimed that we will never go back to capitalism he declared that the resolution was a powerful message to the peoples of the world the message is indeed unmistakable 
ben rhodes the close obama adviser who sold the media on the iran sellout curtly tweeted his justification no reason to vote to defend a failed policy we oppose 
who is this we 
the cuban embargo is the law of the land its the official policy of the united states its based on laws passed by congress and implemented by president john f kennedy and his successors 
this we certainly isnt the united states government its elected representatives in the legislative and executive branches working together to end the old policy and implement a new one 
one member of the we must be ben rhodes because he tells us so who is rhodes an aspiring novelist who pushed obama to back the muslim brotherhood takeover of egypt the iran nuke sellout and now apparently choosing communist cuba over america 
no one has ever elected rhodes to anything but under leftwing rule he outweighs congress president kennedy the law of the land and the national interests of the united states 
we is obama who made the final decision its ambassador samantha power its a number of other functionaries all of whom derive their power from a single elected official who is only one third of the government this is the we that announced its treasonous opposition to the us at the un 
america has a we problem 
if the we of the american left wants to vote its own way it should secede to form its own country 
when president john f kennedy proclaimed the embargo on all trade with cuba he based it on authorization from the congress of the united states that is how our system used to work 
these days el teleprompte in dc decides that he wants to sign a nuclear treaty with iran mandate transgender bathrooms legalize millions of illegal aliens or open relations with his brother tyrant in havana and he does so on his own authority and congress is dismissed as a bunch of obstructionists 
thats not how america is supposed to work thats how iran works thats how cuba works 
the first word in the introduction to obamas presidential policy directive on cuba after the date was i obamas basis for his authority is his  announcement letat cest moi obama is the state 
jfk no humble shrinking violet mentions i only in the fourth paragraph after congress what is the context of kennedys i now therefore i john f kennedy president of the united states of america acting under the authority of section a of the foreign assistance act of  
the i of jfk can only act as a servant not a master 
in obamas directive congress exists only to be berated or badgered for its obstructionism there is no source of authorization for anything other than barack obama there is no law only obama 
now the big we in washington have decided that they will oppose america at the united nations but ben rhodes who aspires to excel at novelistic narratives made an unfortunate slip obama has been accused of louis xivs letat cest moi mentality but ben rhodes isnt saying we are the state instead he tells us that there are two powerful political entities in america one is us the other is we 
we does not yet entirely control the state but we also feels no obligation to the united states if we agrees with america then we will vote with it at the un if we opposes america then we votes against it we will choose patriotism or treason based on its own interests not ours 
we happens to run america but it isnt america its the parasite humped on americas back 
you can call we by many names deep state is one its a coalition of leftwing special interests networking through politics the nonprofit sector and media corporations to control america 
president kennedy was quite familiar with the enemy  we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influenceon infiltration instead of invasion on subversion instead of elections on intimidation instead of free choice 
kennedy was speaking after the recent bay of pigs crisis the foreign assistance act mentioned by him was passed by congress that year while the cuban embargo limited the ability of the castro regime to sponsor and spread terror around the region and the world it didnt stop the we in washington dc 
it is easy to sit here in the distant future of  and wonder whether cuba matters at all but the truth is that we are still enmeshed in the same fundamental struggle of the cold war that struggle did not end when the berlin wall fell it is a battle over whether nations will be ruled by we the people or by the nameless we of the monolithic and ruthless conspiracy of the nomenklatura of the left 
by backing away from america at the united nations the we have announced their independence from the laws responsibilities and duties of the country whose government they have hijacked 
but the we offer us no such independence from their treasonous rule instead they impose on us the collectivism of yevgeny zamyatins novel we in which everyone suffers under the stifling progressive tyranny of the one state that controls every aspect of human life that novel inspired  
what we offer us is what cubas castro wes one state and every communist regime offer us its what george orwell in  summed up as a boot stamping on a human face  forever 
president kennedy dated his embargo proclamation from the one hundred and eightysixth year of the independence of the united states of america at the united nations ambassador power cheerfully declared americas enforced submission to the communist demands for cuba 
the cuban people show no signs of winning independence from their communist overlords the question is will the united states of america be able to regain its independence from the we",english,frontpagemag.com,http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/11/hillary-clinton-email-leak-scandal-fbi-reopens-investigation-latest-updates-4_1.jpg?itok=NB98nciK,hate,Real
Matthew Vadum,2016-11-01T07:32:54.394+02:00,democratic panic,"dawn perlmutter 
the war on law enforcement is epidemic every aspect of culture has been infected the antipolice disease is highly contagious and rapidly spreading on social media in memes in movements in popular fast food restaurants at football games on campuses in media and in every aspect of american culture 
an epidemic is defined as the rapid spread of infectious disease to a large number of people in a given population within a short period of time colin kaepernick is the typhoid mary of the antipolice epidemic kaepernick refuses to stand while the us national anthem is being performed at the start of nfl games as a protest against alleged racial injustice and police brutality on sept  kaepernick chose to kneel on one knee as his protest gesture instead of just sitting on the bench his explanation for his decision to switch is that it was an attempt to show more respect to former and current us military members as if kneeling is somehow symbolically less offensive than sitting he misinterpreted the meaning of the military expression take a knee which occurs when troops take a pause before continuing their mission similar to hands up dont shoot the antipolice gesture has been imbued with a trendy righteousness regardless of its original meaning the media reverently refers to kaepernicks protest as taking a knee as if it is some kind of sacred act there are no headlines that read kaepernick disses the flag or kaepernick takes a crap on his country just in case his gesture didnt send a clear enough message kaepernick also uses clothing to symbolize his antipolice sympathies he has worn everything from tshirts honoring the militant black panther party to socks that depict police as pigs in addition to numerous other crimes the black panther party was responsible for the murder of at least  officers and originated the expression off the pigs meaning murder police 
like the typhoid infected cook mary mallon kaepernick is rapidly spreading the antipolice pathogen in what has been dubbed the kaepernick effect dozens of nfl and wnba players have knelt sat or raised a fist during the national anthem the disease has also spread to over  high schools  colleges and one middle school in what can only be described as a bizarre symbolic contradiction there were two incidents where women performing the star spangled banner got down on one knee in protest of what they were singing one of the women denasia lawrence not only kneeled while performing the anthem but also opened her jacket to display a black lives matter tshirt exposing miami heat fans to the contagious disorder 
rapid spread is well known for infectious diseases the antipolice disorder also contaminated the navy an unidentified sailor assigned to the naval air technical training center in pensacola florida filmed herself deliberately not standing for the national anthem and posted it on facebook she remained seated and raised a fist during morning colors and then praised colin kaepernick another sailor petty officer nd class janaye ervin an intelligence specialist in the navy reserve stationed at pearl harbor did not stand for the national anthem while in uniform she also posted a statement on facebook saying she was inspired by colin kaepernick the navy acted decisively she lost her security clearance and may be facing jail in response to her actions it is yet to be known if facing real consequences will contribute to curing the virus or accelerating it 
kaepernick is just one carrier of the antipolice disease the source of the infection can be attributed to specific movements such as black lives matter that originated in florida during the trayvon martin protests the disease went airborne in ferguson missouri where it was transmitted to college students professional protesters and journalists who subsequently spread the disorder to towns and cities across the country currently the disease seems to cluster around populations that are susceptible to antipolice propaganda the symptoms are irrationality excessive anger impaired perception anxiety hatred and delusions of oppression acute symptoms include sudden changes in behavior aggression paranoia loss of control and homicidal and suicidal tendencies all indicators are expressed in severe disrespect for law and order 
early symptoms of the antipolice epidemic have been observed in various cultural manifestations of contempt for law enforcement officers antipolice graffiti is a common symptom of the virus writing has escalated from insults such as police are murderers to threats of violence a recent popular indicator is the expression kill cops and related variations such as kill all police save a life kill a cop cops lives dont matter and shoot cops threats are also depicted in images such as guns to officers heads violent antipolice rhetoric has also been seen in protest signs that read all my heroes kill cops put wings on pigs kill cops and cops under control or cops under flowers disturbingly antipolice graffiti protests and tweets increase after officers are murdered signifying that violence against cops is celebrated and glorified 
the antipolice epidemic has also spread to wellknown fast food restaurants employees have refused to serve officers at a taco bell in phenix city al dunkin donuts in west hartford ct krispy kreme in columbia sc ihop in virginia beach va arbys in pembroke pines fl chuck e cheese in bowling green ky whataburger in lewisville tx mcdonalds in brenham tx chipotle in brooklyn ny genghis grill in dallas tx noodles  company in alexandria va tropical smoothie in winter haven fl luckys teriyaki sedrowoolley wa and at the krystal restaurant in irondale al other incidents involved employees refusing to let an officer use the restroom in a philadelphia starbucks refusing service at a sunoco gas station in miramar fl writing black lives matter on an officers coffee cup at a dunkin donuts in providence ri and a walmart bakery in mcdonough ga refusing to bake a cake for a police officers retirement party these are just the incidents that have been made public 
refusing service at a restaurant goes beyond gestures of disrespect law enforcement officers are concerned that instead of simply being denied service that their food will be tampered with for this reason many officers will only eat at restaurants where they can see the food being made this is a legitimate concern on aug   in louisville ky five police officers were denied service at a taco bell when another employee took their orders they overheard a conversation between two employees making the food saying im going to mess with them which resulted in them walking out of the restaurant when officers have to fear what is being put in their food there can be no doubt that the war on police is a fullscale epidemic 
the antipolice infection went viral on social media facebook twitter instagram and other social networks have hundreds of antipolice pages ridiculing disrespecting and threatening officers protests and riots are organized on social media and some users openly advocate and celebrate the killing of police officers the following are examples of popular hashtags ftp fuck the police bluelivesmurder acab all cops are bastards bluelivesdontmatter fuckcops fuckthemall apdk all police dept killer fryemlikebacon blacklivesmatter ferguson milwaukeeuprising and kaepernick 
as the disease progresses more acute symptoms begin to manifest in acts of violence a particularly offensive indicator of the disorder is the desecration of fallen officer memorials memorials honoring officers killed in the line of duty have been attacked in philadelphia chicago albuquerque fresno denver new orleans oakland austin honolulu rochester san diego st paul covington richmond goshen fayetteville raleigh and many other cities across the country vandalism has involved everything from dousing in paint toppling and scratching granite burning to destroying a metal torch in order to extinguish the eternal flame in a previous article  i described these acts as symbolic assassinations vandals target tributes to heroic officers because they want to appropriate the valor honor and respect that they think they have been deprived of this is another symptom of the antipolice disease a sense of entitlement and resentment that leads to both symbolic and actual attacks on law enforcement officers 
at its most critical stage the antipolice disorder is lethal this is expressed in the dozens of ambushes and killings of police officers in the most acute phase of the disease some of those infected become homicidal and suicidal targeting and killing officers knowing that they will die in the incident a pattern has emerged that clearly demonstrates that attacks on police escalate from protest gestures to acts of vandalism to deadly shootings that inspire further demonstrations in a continual cycle of protest and violence consequently kaepernicks gesture is neither benign nor harmless it is one symptom in a deadly epidemic",english,frontpagemag.com,http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/10/tr3.jpg?itok=OFI7QhAc,hate,Real
